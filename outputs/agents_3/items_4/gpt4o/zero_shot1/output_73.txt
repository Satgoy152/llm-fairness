Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  48  47  48
1  73  16  14  45
2  51  94  56  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total value, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items. We have 4 items and 3 agents, so one agent will receive 2 items while the other two will receive 1 item each.

Let's evaluate the allocation based on maximizing the total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (81), Item 1 (48)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (73), Item 3 (45)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 2 (56)

We can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, trying to distribute fairly.

- **Agent 0** can take Item 0 (81) since it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2** can take Item 1 (94) since it is their highest valued item.
- For the remaining items, we consider:
  - **Agent 1** can take Item 3 (45) since it's their second highest valued item.
  - The remaining Item 2 can be given to **Agent 2**, who values it at 56, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 14.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
