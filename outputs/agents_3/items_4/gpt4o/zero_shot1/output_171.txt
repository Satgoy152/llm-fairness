Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  53  54  74
1  66  61  15  59
2  61  12  97  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives by considering their preferences. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs, where we try to maximize the overall satisfaction (total valuation) of all agents.

Letâ€™s examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [27, 53, 54, 74]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [66, 61, 15, 59]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [61, 12, 97, 98]

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 98.
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the second highest at 97.
3. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 66.
4. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 53.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonably high total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1 with a valuation of 53.
- Agent 1 receives item 0 with a valuation of 66.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3 with valuations of 97 and 98, respectively.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
