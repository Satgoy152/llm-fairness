Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  19  74   6
1  14  60  62  81
2   3  95  79  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations. We will use a greedy approach to allocate the items to the agents with the highest value for each item while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (highest value).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 95
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (highest value).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 62
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (highest value).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 81
   - Agent 2 values it at 55
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (highest value).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
