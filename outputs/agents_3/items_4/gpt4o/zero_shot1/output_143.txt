Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  33  60  65
1   8   6  91  93
2  42  36  32  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent. One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations by agents. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (93) and item 2 (91). Therefore, it makes sense to allocate these two items to agent 1.

2. **Agent 0**: Among the remaining items (0 and 1), agent 0 values item 1 (33) more highly than agent 2 does (36), and agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 0 (18). Therefore, allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Agent 2**: The only remaining item is item 0. Agent 2 values item 0 (42) the highest among all agents for this item. So, allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Thus, the allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
