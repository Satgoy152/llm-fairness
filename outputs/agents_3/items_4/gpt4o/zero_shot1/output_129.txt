Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  61  51  58
1  91  68  40  28
2  88  29  89   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total value received by each agent. One possible approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 at 91, and Agent 2 at 88. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 68, and Agent 2 at 29. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 40, and Agent 2 at 89. Agent 2 values it the most.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 28, and Agent 2 at 6. Agent 0 values it the most.

Assigning the items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 0 gets item 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
