Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  58  65  24
1  82  48  27  76
2  68  80  81   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach to achieve this is by using a method known as the "maximum sum allocation," where we assign each item to the agent that values it the most.

Let's examine the valuation table and determine the best allocation:

```
Agent 0: [19, 58, 65, 24]
Agent 1: [82, 48, 27, 76]
Agent 2: [68, 80, 81, 7]
```

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 68
   - **Allocate** to Agent 1 (highest value at 82)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 80
   - **Allocate** to Agent 2 (highest value at 80)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 27
   - Agent 2 values it at 81
   - **Allocate** to Agent 2 (highest value at 81)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 24
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 7
   - **Allocate** to Agent 1 (highest value at 76)

Based on these allocations:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
