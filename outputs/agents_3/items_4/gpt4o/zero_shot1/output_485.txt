Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  24  56  73
1  39  97  39  52
2  23  59  54  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total sum of valuations for the items assigned to each agent. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 63 
  - Agent 1: 39 
  - Agent 2: 23 
  - Highest valuation: Agent 0

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 24 
  - Agent 1: 97 
  - Agent 2: 59 
  - Highest valuation: Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 56 
  - Agent 1: 39 
  - Agent 2: 54 
  - Highest valuation: Agent 0

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 73 
  - Agent 1: 52 
  - Agent 2: 40 
  - Highest valuation: Agent 0

Now, let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets no items.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": []
}
```
