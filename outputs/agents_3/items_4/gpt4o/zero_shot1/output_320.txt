Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  72  20  23
1  78   2  58  30
2  25  19  62   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here's a step-by-step consideration of the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0** has valuations: Item 0: 24, Item 1: 72, Item 2: 20, Item 3: 23
- **Agent 1** has valuations: Item 0: 78, Item 1: 2, Item 2: 58, Item 3: 30
- **Agent 2** has valuations: Item 0: 25, Item 1: 19, Item 2: 62, Item 3: 9

To maximize the total valuation while ensuring a fair allocation, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 1** should get Item 0 (valuation 78) because it is the highest value for any agent on any item.
2. **Agent 0** should get Item 1 (valuation 72) as this is the next highest remaining value.
3. **Agent 2** should get Item 2 (valuation 62) as it is the highest value remaining for Agent 2.
4. The remaining item, Item 3, can be given to any agent. An equitable approach is to give it to the agent who hasn't received an item yet or to the agent valuing it highest. However, in this case, all agents have already received an item, so we look for the highest remaining valuation, which is Agent 1 for Item 3 (valuation 30).

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations, with the highest total valuation for the group.
