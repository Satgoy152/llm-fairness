Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  18  37  96
1   5  32  42  12
2  72  27  80  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 18 37 96]
 [ 5 32 42 12]
 [72 27 80 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A fair allocation can mean different things, such as maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0: values items at [95, 18, 37, 96]
- Agent 1: values items at [5, 32, 42, 12]
- Agent 2: values items at [72, 27, 80, 57]

A reasonable approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (95)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (32)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (80)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (96)

Under this allocation, Agent 0 will receive items 0 and 3, Agent 1 will receive item 1, and Agent 2 will receive item 2. This ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
