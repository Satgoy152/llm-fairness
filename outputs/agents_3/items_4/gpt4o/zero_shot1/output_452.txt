Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  96  56  43
1  20  82  20  90
2  44  25  94  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each of them receives at least one item. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3
0   6  96  56  43
1  20  82  20  90
2  44  25  94  85
```

We'll analyze the valuations and allocate the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (96)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (90)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 2 (94)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we still have Item 0 left to allocate. We should allocate it to the agent that would benefit the most from it to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 at 6.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 at 20.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 at 44.

Thus, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
