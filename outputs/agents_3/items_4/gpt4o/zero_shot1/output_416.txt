Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  26  17  88
1   3  38  95  35
2  76  72   5  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 6, Item 1 at 26, Item 2 at 17, Item 3 at 88
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 3, Item 1 at 38, Item 2 at 95, Item 3 at 35
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 at 76, Item 1 at 72, Item 2 at 5, Item 3 at 99

An effective approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it results in each agent getting at least one item.

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (76)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (72)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (95)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (99)

Notice that Agent 2 is receiving three items which is more than intended, and Agent 0 is not receiving any. To balance this, we can consider the next highest valuations for the items:

1. **Reallocate Item 1** to Agent 0 (26) 
   - Now Agent 0 gets Item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2.
   - Agent 2 gets Items 0 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized under these constraints. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
