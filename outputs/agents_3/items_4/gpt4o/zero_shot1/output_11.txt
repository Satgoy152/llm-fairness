Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  90  31  71
1  79   3  36  15
2  66   5  47  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Letâ€™s consider the valuations and make a decision based on maximizing the sum of valuations for all agents.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 - 42, Item 1 - 90, Item 2 - 31, Item 3 - 71
- Agent 1: Item 0 - 79, Item 1 - 3, Item 2 - 36, Item 3 - 15
- Agent 2: Item 0 - 66, Item 1 - 5, Item 2 - 47, Item 3 - 93

We will allocate the items to the agents based on highest preference:

1. Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 at 90.
2. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 at 93.
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 at 47.
4. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 at 79.

The allocation based on the maximum valuations for each item is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1
- Agent 1 receives Item 0
- Agent 2 receives Items 2 and 3

Now presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
