Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  63  98  65
1  72  81  81  77
2  22  71  27  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Allocate item 2 to agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 at 98. This is the highest value for any item across all agents.

2. **Allocate item 1 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 at 81, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item.

3. **Allocate item 3 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 at 77, which is the highest valuation for this item across all agents.

4. **Allocate item 0 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 72, and this is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item.

Now, agent 1 gets three items, agent 0 gets one item, and agent 2 gets no items. Although agent 2 does not receive any items, this allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
