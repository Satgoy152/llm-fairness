Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  16  36  45
1  37   9  30  72
2   8  14  99   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [37  9 30 72]
 [ 8 14 99  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets the items they value highly. One common approach is to use the "Maximum Weighted Matching" or "Maximal Bipartite Matching" in a preference matrix, but for simplicity, I'll manually assign items based on maximizing total value per agent without overlap.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [20, 16, 36, 45]
Agent 1: [37, 9, 30, 72]
Agent 2: [8, 14, 99, 3]
```

Let's assign the items:

1. Agent 2 has a very high valuation of item 2 (value 99), so it makes sense to assign item 2 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation of item 3 (value 72), so item 3 is assigned to Agent 1.
3. For items 0 and 1, Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 37), and Agent 0 has the highest for item 1 (value 16).

After considering the highest values, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items while maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items.
