Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  46  48  14
1  83  96  14  71
2  95  84  72  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [83 96 14 71]
 [95 84 72 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and only 4 items are allocated in total.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 2 (48).
2. Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 1 (96).
3. Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 0 (95).
4. The remaining item, item 3, has a high valuation by agent 2 (88).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their preferred items, maximizing their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and no more than 4 items are allocated in total.
