Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  10  49  62
1  50  81   6  11
2  71  70  73  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We will use a simple approach to assign items, focusing on maximizing individual agent satisfaction for each item:

1. Review the valuations:
   - Agent 0 values: [57, 10, 49, 62]
   - Agent 1 values: [50, 81, 6, 11]
   - Agent 2 values: [71, 70, 73, 65]

2. Assign items based on highest valuation per item:
   - Item 0: Highest value is from Agent 2 (71)
   - Item 1: Highest value is from Agent 1 (81)
   - Item 2: Highest value is from Agent 2 (73)
   - Item 3: Highest value is from Agent 0 (62)

3. The assignment based on valuations will look like this:
   - Agent 0 gets item 3
   - Agent 1 gets item 1
   - Agent 2 gets items 0 and 2

Thus, our allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
