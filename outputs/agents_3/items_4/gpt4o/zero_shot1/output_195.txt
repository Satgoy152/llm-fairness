Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  36  92  62
1  55  79  67  34
2  43  37   1  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets items based on their highest valuations while also trying to balance the number of items each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item unless necessary.

Here is one possible allocation that considers the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 55, Agent 0 values it at 47, and Agent 2 values it at 43.  
   Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value).

2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 79, Agent 0 values it at 36, and Agent 2 values it at 37.  
   Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value).

3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 67, and Agent 2 values it at 1.  
   Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).

4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 88, Agent 0 values it at 62, and Agent 1 values it at 34.  
   Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value).

By ensuring each item goes to the agent who values it most, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while all items are distributed fairly.
