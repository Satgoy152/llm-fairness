Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  29  17  89
1  94  42  14   4
2  86  40  68   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Values item 0 at 87
  - Values item 1 at 29
  - Values item 2 at 17
  - Values item 3 at 89

- Agent 1:
  - Values item 0 at 94
  - Values item 1 at 42
  - Values item 2 at 14
  - Values item 3 at 4

- Agent 2:
  - Values item 0 at 86
  - Values item 1 at 40
  - Values item 2 at 68
  - Values item 3 at 5

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow a strategy where each agent receives the item they value the most, provided there are no conflicts. If multiple agents want the same item, we consider the next highest value or negotiate among the remaining items. 

Let's allocate:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 94.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 1 also values item 1 highly, but they already received item 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the second highest among the contenders at 29.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 68.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 89.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Following these allocations, we ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated without conflicts.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
