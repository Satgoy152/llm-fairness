Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  74  23  65
1  70  26   7  79
2  48  34  58   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Valuations Table:
    0   1   2   3
0  80  74  23  65
1  70  26   7  79
2  48  34  58   9
```

Let's use a simple greedy approach to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 0 (80). 
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 3 (79).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 2 (58).
4. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for item 1 (74), after the highest values have been assigned.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
