Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  39  83  52
1  41  84  71  57
2  14  81  68  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to optimize the allocation such that each agent receives the items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [35, 39, 83, 52]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [41, 84, 71, 57]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [14, 81, 68, 31]

Let's start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent to maximize their individual satisfaction:

- **Item 2** should go to Agent 0 because it's Agent 0's highest valued item (83).
- **Item 1** should go to Agent 1 because it's Agent 1's highest valued item (84).
- **Item 1** is also highly valued by Agent 2, but Agent 1's valuation is higher, so Agent 1 gets it.
- **Item 0** should go to Agent 1 because it's their second-highest valued item (41) and is not highly valued by others.
- **Item 3** should go to Agent 0 because it's their second-highest valued item (52) and no one has a significantly higher valuation for it.

Now let's review to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 1
- **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 1
- **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 0
- **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 0

Finally, **Agent 2** has no items allocated due to higher bids by other agents on their preferred items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent's highest priorities are considered, and all items are allocated fairly based on the given valuations.
