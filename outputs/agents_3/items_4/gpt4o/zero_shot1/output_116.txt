Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  84  59  52
1  68   0  70   5
2  98  15  36  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent. In this case, we will attempt to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while taking into account their preferences.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 52

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 5

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 53

A fair allocation strategy is to allocate each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then allocate remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

1. Agent 0 values Item 1 the most.
2. Agent 1 values Item 2 the most.
3. Agent 2 values Item 0 the most.

This leaves Item 3 unallocated. Agent 2 values Item 3 more than Agent 0 and Agent 1, so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

Based on this strategy, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
