Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  39  87  83
1  13  76  38  63
2  86  96  23  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents with their allocations. One common approach is to use the "maximum sum allocation" method, where we try to maximize the total value of the items to the agents by giving each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since we have a constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and there are only four items, we should also consider the distribution of items to ensure fairness.

Here's a step-by-step approach for this allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent.** This helps to initially allocate items to agents based on their highest preferences.

2. **Assign items to maximize the overall value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.** Since we have three agents and four items, one agent might receive two items.

3. **Iterate over potential allocations to ensure fairness.** We ensure that no agent receives a disproportionately low value unless necessary.

Following these steps for the given table:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (87). 
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest (76).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (98).

Initially, we can assign these items to the respective agents.

- **Item 0** should be assigned to an agent who values it the most considering the remaining need:
  - Agent 0 values item 0 as 28.
  - Agent 1 values item 0 as 13.
  - Agent 2 values item 0 as 86.

Thus, item 0 should be assigned to Agent 2 to maximize overall allocation value.

The final allocation would be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 3

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
