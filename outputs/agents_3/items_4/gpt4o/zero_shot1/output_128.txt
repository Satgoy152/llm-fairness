Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  68   6   1
1  95  88  81   2
2  81   2  72  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can use the Hungarian algorithm or a simpler heuristic approach to achieve a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 50, 68, 6, 1
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 95, 88, 81, 2
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 81, 2, 72, 68

A simple heuristic approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is optimally allocated:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (95).
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (88).
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (81).
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (68).

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation gives Agent 1 three items and Agent 2 one item, while Agent 0 receives none. However, this ensures that the items are allocated in a way that provides the highest satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
