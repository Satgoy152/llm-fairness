Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  53  31  73
1   1  60  33  39
2  48  15  54  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign the highest valued item for each agent**: Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, provided that item is not already assigned to another agent with a higher valuation.

2. **Consider remaining items**: After each agent has one item or as many as possible while keeping fairness, assign the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Ensure that all items have been allocated by checking if any agent can receive additional items without reducing fairness.

Here's how it plays out with the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (75), item 3 second highest (73).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (60).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (54).

Following these steps, the allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 75).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 60).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 54).

Now, we need to allocate the last item, item 3:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 73.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 39.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 41.

Since Agent 0 values the remaining item 3 the most, assign item 3 to Agent 0.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
