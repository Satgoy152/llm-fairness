Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  41  63  49
1  80  66  96  74
2  54  81  24  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method where each agent gets one item, and we try to maximize total value by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 54
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Agent 2 values it at 81
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

Now, let's see the allocations. Agent 1 got three items, which is not allowed as each agent should get an integer number of items and in this case not more than one due to 4 items and 3 agents. Let's reallocate to ensure fairness:

1. **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1
2. **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2
3. **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0
4. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 had the second highest value and Agent 1 already got item 0)

This way, every agent gets at least one item, and the allocations are balanced. Here are the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.
