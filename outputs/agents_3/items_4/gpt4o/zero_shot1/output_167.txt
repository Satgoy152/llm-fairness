Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  74  52  30
1  36  27  11  72
2  24  67  85  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the four items among the three agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [99, 74, 52, 30]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 with a value of 99.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [36, 27, 11, 72]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 with a value of 72.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [24, 67, 85, 92]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 with a value of 92.

To maximize total value, we should allocate based on the highest available value for each agent, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it highest, and it's the only item above 70 for them).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has the lowest overall valuation, give them the remaining item).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent according to their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
