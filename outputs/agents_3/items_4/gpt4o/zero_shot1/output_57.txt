Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  88   7  10
1  26  49  88  44
2  19   7  98  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. In this scenario, we can look for a way that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the sum of the values for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for item 1 (value 88).
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for item 2 (value 88).
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 3 (value 91).
4. Agent 2 also has a high valuation for item 0 (value 19), which, although not the highest, complements the high value of item 3.

Considering these points, we can assign the items as follows:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 88 to agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 88 to agent 1).
- Assign items 0 and 3 to agent 2 (values 19 and 91 to agent 2).

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on maximum valuations while ensuring each agent gets a significant value. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
