Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  95  28  28
1   7  41   5  22
2  48  14  48  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both maximizing each agent's satisfaction (based on their valuations) and ensuring an equitable distribution of items. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1.
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1, but since Agent 0 values it much more, we consider the next best options for Agent 1.

Based on these considerations, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1 (since these are the highest valued by Agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (as it's the next best option for Agent 1).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (since Agent 2 values this item the most).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
