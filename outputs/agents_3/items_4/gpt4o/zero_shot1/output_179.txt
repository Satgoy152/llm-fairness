Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  70  46   7
1  58  94  27  52
2  96  91  39   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent is assigned an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [94, 70, 46, 7]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [58, 94, 27, 52]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [96, 91, 39, 2]

We need to allocate all 4 items (0, 1, 2, 3) to agents 0, 1, and 2.

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (96).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 (94).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (46).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (52).

However, this allocation gives Agent 1 two items, so we need to adjust to ensure fairness and integer allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

Now let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
