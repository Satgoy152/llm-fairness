Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  70  84  89
1  23  88  38  45
2  91  17  17  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with exactly 4 items being allocated in total. One approach is to allocate items in such a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, which can be achieved by examining the highest valuations each agent has for the items.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has the following valuations: [64, 70, 84, 89].
2. **Agent 1** has the following valuations: [23, 88, 38, 45].
3. **Agent 2** has the following valuations: [91, 17, 17, 11].

We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives:

- Start by allocating the most valued items to the respective agents.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Item 3** (highest value of 89 for Agent 0) should be allocated to **Agent 0**.
2. **Item 0** (highest value of 91 for Agent 2) should be allocated to **Agent 2**.
3. **Item 1** (highest remaining value of 88 for Agent 1) should be allocated to **Agent 1**.
4. **Item 2** (next highest value of 84 for Agent 0) should be allocated to **Agent 0**.

Thus, the allocation is:

- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 1** receives item 1.
- **Agent 2** receives item 0.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
