Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  30  37  91
1  58  28   7  99
2  22  77  25  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 96
  - Agent 1 values it at 58
  - Agent 2 values it at 22
  - Highest valuation: Agent 0

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 30
  - Agent 1 values it at 28
  - Agent 2 values it at 77
  - Highest valuation: Agent 2

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 37
  - Agent 1 values it at 7
  - Agent 2 values it at 25
  - Highest valuation: Agent 0

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 91
  - Agent 1 values it at 99
  - Agent 2 values it at 19
  - Highest valuation: Agent 1

Based on the highest valuation approach, the allocations can be made as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2
- Agent 1 gets item 3
- Agent 2 gets item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
