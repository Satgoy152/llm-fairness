Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  11  37  71
1  40  59  79  87
2  34  31  25   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 59 79 87]
 [34 31 25  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [79, 11, 37, 71]
- Agent 1: [40, 59, 79, 87]
- Agent 2: [34, 31, 25, 8]

We can allocate items to agents by maximizing their individual valuations on items and ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (79).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (87).
3. Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 2 (79), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 2 can receive item 1, as it is not strongly preferred by others, and it gives Agent 2 at least one item.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3
- Agent 2 gets item 1

Now, formatting this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
