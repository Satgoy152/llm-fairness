Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  28   7   3  96
1   8  89  96   9
2  12  19  72   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [28, 7, 3, 96]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [8, 89, 96, 9]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [12, 19, 72, 7]

By examining these valuations, we can identify which agent values each item the most:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (28).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (89).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (96).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (96).

To ensure fairness, let's distribute the items while considering these aspects:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

This way, we maximize the value for each agent while ensuring a fair allocation. Agent 2, unfortunately, will not receive any items as their valuations are significantly lower compared to the others.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
