Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  29  41  11
1  99  59  73   4
2  18  58  51  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents.** This helps ensure that items are allocated to agents who value them the most.

2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the highest, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.**

Let's analyze the table:

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 4
  - Agent 1 values it at 99 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 18
  - **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 29
  - Agent 1 values it at 59 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 58
  - **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 41
  - Agent 1 values it at 73 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 51
  - **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 11
  - Agent 1 values it at 4
  - Agent 2 values it at 51 (highest)
  - **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**

This initial allocation gives all items to Agent 1 except for Item 3, which goes to Agent 2. To ensure fairness and that each agent receives an item, we can adjust the allocations as follows:

- **Reassign Item 2 to Agent 0** since Agent 0 values it fairly high (41) and currently has no items.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0 gets Item 2
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1
- Agent 2 gets Item 3

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
