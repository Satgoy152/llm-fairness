Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  85  41  79
1  10  88  62  32
2  28  51  10  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Analyze the table to find which items have the highest value for each agent:

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (85), followed by item 3 (79).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (88), followed by item 2 (62).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (51), followed by item 0 (28).

2. Considering the highest valuations, we can distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for them.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the second-highest valued item and Agent 0 already has item 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their second-highest valued item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it highly and it maximizes their total valuation.

3. Verify the allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives item 2.
   - Agent 2 receives item 0.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
