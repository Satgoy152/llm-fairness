Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  99  86  57
1  63  81  87  98
2   9  18  33  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 81 87 98]
 [ 9 18 33 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total value of the allocations. This can be achieved by evaluating the value each agent places on each item and assigning the items such that the overall value is maximized while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Considering the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [90, 99, 86, 57]
- Agent 1: [63, 81, 87, 98]
- Agent 2: [9, 18, 33, 24]

The goal is to allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents. Let's consider the highest valuations and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value is 90 for Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value is 99 for Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value is 87 for Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value is 98 for Agent 1.

Now, let's distribute the items to agents ensuring a fair allocation:

- Assign Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 will not receive any items as their valuation is significantly lower than the others, ensuring a fair allocation under the given constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
