Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  44   8  93
1  72  10   5  71
2  81  15  62  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will follow a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. One way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 88
  - Agent 1: 72
  - Agent 2: 81
  - Highest valuation by Agent 0.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 44
  - Agent 1: 10
  - Agent 2: 15
  - Highest valuation by Agent 0.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 8
  - Agent 1: 5
  - Agent 2: 62
  - Highest valuation by Agent 2.

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 93
  - Agent 1: 71
  - Agent 2: 68
  - Highest valuation by Agent 0.

Considering the highest valuation for each item, we can initially assign:

- Item 0 to Agent 0
- Item 1 to Agent 0
- Item 2 to Agent 2
- Item 3 to Agent 0

However, Agent 0 has been assigned three items, while Agent 1 has none. To ensure a fair distribution where each agent gets a reasonable share, we can adjust the assignments:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has the second-highest valuation and no items)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it more than Agent 2 and has space)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
