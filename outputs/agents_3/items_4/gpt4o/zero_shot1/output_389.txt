Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  88  17  94
1  23  53  95  75
2  35  90  44  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (39), 1 (88), 2 (17), 3 (94)
- Agent 1: Items 0 (23), 1 (53), 2 (95), 3 (75)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (35), 1 (90), 2 (44), 3 (30)

We will try to assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them and ensure that each agent, if possible, receives at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (94).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (95).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (90).

This leaves item 0, which has the following valuations:
- Agent 0: 39
- Agent 1: 23
- Agent 2: 35

Since Agent 0 already has a high-value item 3, and Agent 1 has item 2, we allocate item 0 to Agent 2, who values it at 35.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 1, 0

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
