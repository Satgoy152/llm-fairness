Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  67   2  29
1  45  65  22  76
2  42  80  36  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here’s one way to approach this task:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 0 (60) and item 1 (67).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (76) significantly.
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 (80).

2. **Possible Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 since it's the highest valuation for any item by any agent.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 as it's their highest-valued item.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 as it's the highest available for that agent.
   - Allocate the remaining item 2 to Agent 0, as it’s a leftover and the least valued item overall.

With this strategy, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.

This ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here’s the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
