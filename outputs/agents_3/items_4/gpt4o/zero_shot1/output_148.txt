Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  48  22  63
1  62  26   1  16
2  57  58   1  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can utilize a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a variation of the Hungarian algorithm or a greedy method that assigns items based on the highest valuations.

Let's attempt a fair allocation by considering the highest value items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (63), Item 0 (58), Item 1 (48), Item 2 (22)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (62), Item 1 (26), Item 3 (16), Item 2 (1)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (58), Item 0 (57), Item 3 (50), Item 2 (1)

Using a greedy approach:
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 63 for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 62 for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 58 for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 22 for Agent 0).

This allocation ensures the items are allocated in a way that considers the agents' preferences and maximizes overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
