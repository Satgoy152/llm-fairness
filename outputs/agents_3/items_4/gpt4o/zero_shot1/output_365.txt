Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  57  59  81
1  35  16  78  73
2  28  73  39  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to maximize the total satisfaction. We will assign items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 30     | 57     | 59     | 81     |
| 1     | 35     | 16     | 78     | 73     |
| 2     | 28     | 73     | 39     | 99     |

Based on the valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 3 (81).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 2 (78).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for Item 3 (99), which is higher than Agent 0's valuation for Item 3. However, since Agent 0 also values Item 3 highly and Agent 2 values Item 1 highly, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 to maximize overall value.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (81 is the highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (78 is the highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (73 is the highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it more than others.

Therefore, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
