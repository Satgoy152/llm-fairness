Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  61  20  85
1  31   2  36  77
2   6  29  71  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 61 20 85]
 [31  2 36 77]
 [ 6 29 71 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both maximizing the total utility (or value) and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [55, 61, 20, 85]
Agent 1: [31, 2, 36, 77]
Agent 2: [6, 29, 71, 59]
```

Let's consider the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 85. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 71. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
3. Agent 1 values item 0 at 31, which is the highest available after considering other preferences. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
4. The remaining item 1 is most valued by agent 0 at 61, so assign item 1 to agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
