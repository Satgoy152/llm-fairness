Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  39  75  51
1  18  88  69   5
2   1  73  55  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. One method to achieve this is to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [49, 39, 75, 51]
- Agent 1 values: [18, 88, 69, 5]
- Agent 2 values: [1, 73, 55, 90]

We can approach this by assigning each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair number of items.

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 0 (49)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 1 (88)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (75)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 2 (90)

Now, let's redistribute to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [3]

With this allocation, each agent has a fair share, considering their highest valued items. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
