Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  68  66  68
1  67  36  13  17
2  39  17  73  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 68

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 17

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 87

To maximize fairness, let's allocate items based on the highest valuation each item receives from any agent:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 67 (Agent 1)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 68 (Agent 0)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 73 (Agent 2)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 87 (Agent 2)

Now, we need to ensure that items are fairly distributed among agents, given that each agent receives an integer number of items and four items are allocated in total. 

Let's consider the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an optimal item based on their highest valuation, with Agent 2 receiving two items which they value highly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their individual valuations given the constraints.
