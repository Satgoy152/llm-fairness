Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  53  21  92
1  69  36  88  75
2  36  75  73  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [36 75 73 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can look at maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. One common method is to use the "maximum bipartite matching" approach, which attempts to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, but ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's analyze the valuation table and make allocations:

### Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  40  53  21  92
1  69  36  88  75
2  36  75  73  38
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 92. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 with a value of 88. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 with a value of 75. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Remaining Item (0)**: Now, item 0 needs to be assigned. 
   - Agent 1 values it at 69, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 0 compared to agent 0 (40) and agent 2 (36). Assign item 0 to agent 1.

### Allocation Summary:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 1

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share and maximizes their respective valuations. Note that fairness could be interpreted in different ways, but this allocation prioritizes higher valuations for each agent while distributing all items.
