Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  38  77  22
1  15  68  76  14
2  95  83  44  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method called "maximizing total utility" or "max-sum allocation." This method aims to maximize the total value derived by all agents collectively. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all possible allocations**: We need to assign each item to exactly one agent.

2. **Calculate total utility for each allocation**: For each possible allocation, calculate the sum of the values that agents derive from the items they receive.

3. **Choose the allocation with the highest total utility**.

Using the table provided, let's calculate:

- Agent 0 values: [33, 38, 77, 22]
- Agent 1 values: [15, 68, 76, 14]
- Agent 2 values: [95, 83, 44, 93]

Let's consider an allocation that maximizes the total sum of the values:

- Give item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 95)
- Give item 1 to Agent 2 (value = 83)
- Give item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 77)
- Give item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 93)

This allocation provides the following values to each agent:
- Agent 0: 77
- Agent 1: 0
- Agent 2: 95 + 83 + 93 = 271

This allocation maximizes the total utility: 77 + 0 + 271 = 348.

Thus, the allocation in the desired JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
