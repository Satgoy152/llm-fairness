Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  60  70  13
1  88  42  43  42
2  95  40  96  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's consider a few allocation strategies:

1. **Maximize Total Value:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Using this strategy, we look at the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 60.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 also values it the most at 85.

However, this would give all items to Agent 2, which might not be fair in terms of spreading items among agents.

2. **Fair Distribution with High Value:**
   - Try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is still reasonably high.

Let's try to distribute fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 60)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 88)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 96) and Item 3 (value 85)

This allocation gives every agent at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized within these constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
