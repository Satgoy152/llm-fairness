Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  98  46  29
1  26  98  95  60
2  40  86  16  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. A common approach is to use the "Hungarian algorithm" or similar methods to find an optimal assignment. Given the small size of the problem, we can manually determine an allocation that seems fair and aims to maximize the total valuation.

Here are the valuations for quick reference:

- Agent 0: [44, 98, 46, 29]
- Agent 1: [26, 98, 95, 60]
- Agent 2: [40, 86, 16, 12]

A possible fair allocation maximizing total valuations could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 98)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 95)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 40)
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 12)

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
