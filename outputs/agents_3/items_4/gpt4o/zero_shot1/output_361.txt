Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  90  14  48
1  99  31  19  11
2  35  56  22  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value derived by all agents. The goal is to allocate the items in a way such that the agents receive items they value most while ensuring all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 90, 14, 48]
- Agent 1: [99, 31, 19, 11]
- Agent 2: [35, 56, 22, 97]

Let's consider the highest value each agent has for the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (90).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (99).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97).

Now, let's allocate these items to the respective agents:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Now, we have allocated 3 items. There is 1 item left (item 2), which needs to be allocated. Let's allocate item 2 to the agent who values it the most among those who haven't received a high-value item yet. 

Checking the valuations for item 2:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 14 (already received item 1).
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 19 (already received item 0).
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 22 (already received item 3).

Since all agents have received an item and agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2, we can allocate item 2 to agent 2 as well.

Here's the final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 2.

The allocations in the required JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
