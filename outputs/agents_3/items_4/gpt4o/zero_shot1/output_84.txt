Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  84   5  31
1  86   9  79  80
2   0  81  90  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that their overall satisfaction is maximized, considering the given valuations. 

Let's examine the possible allocations:

- Agent 0 values: [56, 84, 5, 31]
- Agent 1 values: [86, 9, 79, 80]
- Agent 2 values: [0, 81, 90, 50]

One potential approach is to try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent by ensuring that the highest valued items for each agent are distributed to them. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 84)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 86)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 90)

Now, the remaining item is 3, which Agent 1 values at 80, which is their second highest valuation for an item.

Therefore, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
