Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  75  59  75
1  68  68   9  88
2  62  99  99  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [62 99 99 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value received by each agent. Given this, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [38, 75, 59, 75]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [68, 68, 9, 88]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [62, 99, 99, 63]

To maximize fairness, we'll aim to allocate items such that each agent receives the highest possible valuation for the items they receive, balancing the distribution of total value across agents.

1. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest at 99.

2. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 2 also values Item 2 the highest at 99.

3. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest at 88.

4. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 68 (Agent 0 values it at 38, which is lower).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
