Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  81  99  43
1  95  33  72  48
2  65   3  26  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 81 99 43]
 [95 33 72 48]
 [65  3 26 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent places on the items and aim to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [90, 81, 99, 43]
Agent 1: [95, 33, 72, 48]
Agent 2: [65, 3, 26, 69]
```

A potential fair allocation could involve giving each agent the item they value most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the highest at 99.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 0 the highest at 95.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 3 the highest at 69.

Now, item 1 is not yet assigned. We need to decide which agent should receive this item.

- **Agent 0's** second highest value is for item 1 at 81.
- **Agent 1's** second highest value is for item 2 at 72, but item 2 is already assigned.
- **Agent 2's** second highest value is for item 0 at 65, but item 0 is already assigned.

Giving item 1 to **Agent 0** maximizes the total value, as it is the highest unassigned value after initial allocations.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 1.
- **Agent 1** receives item 0.
- **Agent 2** receives item 3.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
