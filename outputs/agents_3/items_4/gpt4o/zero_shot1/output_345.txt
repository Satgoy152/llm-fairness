Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  21  68  37
1  55  49  85  82
2  28  99  32  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (79), Item 1 (21), Item 2 (68), Item 3 (37)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (55), Item 1 (49), Item 2 (85), Item 3 (82)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (28), Item 1 (99), Item 2 (32), Item 3 (35)

A potential allocation strategy is to assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

1. Agent 0 should get the item where they have the highest valuation, which is Item 0 (79).
2. Agent 1 should get the item where they have the highest valuation, which is Item 2 (85).
3. Agent 2 should get the item where they have the highest valuation, which is Item 1 (99).

This leaves Item 3, which we can allocate to Agent 1, who has the second-highest valuation for this item (82), maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
