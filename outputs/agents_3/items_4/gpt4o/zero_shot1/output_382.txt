Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  77  89  11
1  35  45   6  96
2  84  73  80  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (for fairness) if possible. Since there are three agents and four items, one agent will necessarily receive two items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations: [20, 77, 89, 11]
- Agent 1 has valuations: [35, 45, 6, 96]
- Agent 2 has valuations: [84, 73, 80, 90]

To allocate items fairly, we can consider the maximum valuation each agent has for an item and try to assign items based on those.

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (84), so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (89), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (96), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, we have:
- Item 0 to Agent 2
- Item 2 to Agent 0
- Item 3 to Agent 1

This leaves item 1 to be allocated. To maintain fairness, we should look at the value of item 1 for each agent:
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 77
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 45
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 73

Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
