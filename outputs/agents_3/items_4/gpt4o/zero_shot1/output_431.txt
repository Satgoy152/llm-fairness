Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  27   3  42
1  69   8   8  78
2  96  88  15  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that each agent gets the most value possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

The table of valuations is as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (76), Item 1 (27), Item 2 (3), Item 3 (42)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (69), Item 1 (8), Item 2 (8), Item 3 (78)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (96), Item 1 (88), Item 2 (15), Item 3 (39)

Let's consider allocating the items based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 2 (96).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 2 (88).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value for Agent 1 (8), although Agent 0 also has a tie value (3).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 1 (78).

Based on these maximum valuations, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation maximizes the total individual agent valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 1.
