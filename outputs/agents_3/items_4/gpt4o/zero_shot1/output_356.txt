Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  15  77  47
1   8  50  85  34
2  32  16  93  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A fair allocation should take into account both maximizing the total value and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 77)
   - Allocation: Item 2

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 85), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest valued item: Item 1 (value 50)
   - Allocation: Item 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 93), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest valued item: Item 0 (value 32)
   - Allocation: Item 0

The remaining item is Item 3. We can assign it to Agent 1 or Agent 2 since Agent 0 already has one item. Letâ€™s assign it to Agent 1 as they have the next highest valuation for it.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total value is reasonably distributed.
