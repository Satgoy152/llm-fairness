Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  60  77  69
1  42  15  52  80
2  43   3  43  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 96, 60, 77, 69
- Agent 1 values: 42, 15, 52, 80
- Agent 2 values: 43, 3, 43, 67

A possible allocation strategy is to allocate the items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (96)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (60)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (77)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (80)

Let's check if we can distribute any items to Agent 2. If we give item 3 to Agent 1, then Agent 1 gets that item because they value it the most among the unallocated items. This will leave Agent 2 with no items, which is unfair.

To ensure fairness, we can consider allocating items as follows:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 (96)
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 (3)
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 (77)
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 (80)

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item, and we are considering the highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation considers fairness by ensuring each agent receives an item, and the total number of allocated items is 4.
