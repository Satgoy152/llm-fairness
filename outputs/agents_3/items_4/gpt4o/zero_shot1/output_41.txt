Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  24   4  99
1  24  44  89  47
2   6  30  84  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total utility based on the given valuations. This often involves matching items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total utility is maximized.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [79, 24, 4, 99]
- Agent 1 values: [24, 44, 89, 47]
- Agent 2 values: [6, 30, 84, 53]

A fair allocation would try to distribute these items so that each agent gets an item they value highly.

1. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (99).
2. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (89).
3. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (79), but since Agent 0 already gets item 3, let's consider the next highest value, which is Agent 1 (24).
4. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (44), but since Agent 1 already gets item 2, the next highest is Agent 2 (30).

Given these observations, a potential allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [3] (since they value item 3 the most)
- Agent 1: [2, 0] (since they value item 2 the most and have a reasonable valuation for item 0)
- Agent 2: [1] (since they value item 1 the most among the remaining options)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to maximize the total utility based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
