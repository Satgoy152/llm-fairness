Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  87   2  87  18
1   9  16  95   7
2  38   2   7  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuations for the agents while ensuring each one gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Likely prefers item 0 (value 87) or item 2 (value 87).

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Strongly values item 2 (value 95).

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Prefers item 3 (value 63).

With these preferences in mind, we can allocate as follows to fairly distribute the items:

- **Agent 0:** receives item 0. (Value = 87)
- **Agent 1:** receives item 2. (Value = 95)
- **Agent 2:** receives item 3. (Value = 63)

Now, we have one item left, item 1, which has low values for each agent. We can allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items:

- **Agent 0:** receives items 0 and 1.

This results in:

- Agent 0: items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: item 2
- Agent 2: item 3

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
