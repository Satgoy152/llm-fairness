Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  55  39  25
1  98  13  67  60
2  32   4  57  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 0 55 39 25]
 [98 13 67 60]
 [32  4 57 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0   0  55  39  25
1  98  13  67  60
2  32   4  57  78
```

We will allocate the items by considering the highest valuations for each item across agents:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (55).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (67).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (78).

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 will receive Item 1 (highest value for them).
- Agent 1 will receive Item 0 and Item 2 (as they value these items the most).
- Agent 2 will receive Item 3 (highest value for them).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total allocation consists of all 4 items. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
