Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  94  61  36
1  76  77  12  92
2   5  50  54  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use a method that aims to give each agent the item they value most while avoiding conflicts.

Let's analyze the table:

```
Agent 0: 60, 94, 61, 36
Agent 1: 76, 77, 12, 92
Agent 2: 5, 50, 54, 72
```

We'll start by assigning the highest value for each item to an agent, and then adjust to ensure fairness:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 60
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 76)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 50
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 94)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 61
   - Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Agent 2 values it at 54
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 61)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 2 values it at 72
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 92)

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, while each agent receives an integer number of items.
