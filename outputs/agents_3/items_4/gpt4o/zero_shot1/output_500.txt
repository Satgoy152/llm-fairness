Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  99  97  17
1  16  47  17  58
2  94  68  68  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their value while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Firstly, let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 17

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 58

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 34

We will aim to maximize the total value each agent perceives from the items allocated to them:

1. Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 99.
2. Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest at 94.
3. There are two remaining items, Items 2 and 3. 

Let's assign these items based on the highest residual valuations:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 highly at 97, so let's assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 should get the remaining Item 3, which they value at 58 (the highest value Agent 1 has for any unallocated item).

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1 and Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
