Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  88  78   3
1  49  55  59   7
2  39  82  53  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from the items. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - **Assign item 0 to Agent 1** (since 49 is the highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - **Assign item 1 to Agent 0** (since 88 is the highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - **Assign item 2 to Agent 0** (since 78 is the highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - **Assign item 3 to Agent 2** (since 79 is the highest valuation).

Based on the above allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing individual satisfaction within the constraint of distributing all items.
