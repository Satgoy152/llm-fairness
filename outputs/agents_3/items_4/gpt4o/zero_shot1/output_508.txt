Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  65  54  92
1  96  55  94  97
2  71  44  88  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation of the items for all agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and every item is allocated. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 97.
2. **Agent 1** also values item 0 highly with a value of 96.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 with a value of 88.
4. **Agent 0** can receive item 1, which is not highly valued by the other agents, maximizing the total satisfaction.

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
