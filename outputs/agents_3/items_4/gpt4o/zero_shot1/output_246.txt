Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  93  45  10
1  59  61  63  80
2  88  61  71  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on any item and try to allocate that item to them if it doesn't overlap with another agent's highest value.
2. If there's an overlap, consider the next highest value that doesn't overlap and allocate accordingly.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 95, 93, 45, 10.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 59, 61, 63, 80.
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: 88, 61, 71, 67.

Step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0's highest value is for item 0 (95).
- Agent 1's highest value is for item 3 (80).
- Agent 2's highest value is for item 0 (88), but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 (71).

Allocate items based on the highest unique values:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, there is one item left: item 1.

- Check remaining preferences:
  - Agent 0: item 1 (93)
  - Agent 1: item 1 (61)
  - Agent 2: item 1 (61)

Since Agent 0 values item 1 the highest among the remaining choices, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
