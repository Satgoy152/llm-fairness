Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  84  18   7
1  29  86  87   7
2  74  63  44  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 63 44 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and no item is assigned more than once.

Let's examine the table for the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 60, 84, 18, 7
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 29, 86, 87, 7
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: 74, 63, 44, 64

We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2 (74).
2. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (86).
3. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (87).
4. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 2 (64).

To ensure fairness, we can adjust the allocation to give each agent at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (60), as it is the highest value for them and item 0 is not highly valued by others compared to their best items.
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (87), which is their highest value.
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (64), which is their second-highest value.

Now, Agent 1 can also take item 1 (86) since it's their second-highest valued item, and the only remaining one.

Thus, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [3]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
