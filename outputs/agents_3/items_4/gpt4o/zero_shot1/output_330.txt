Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  97  91  53
1  61  99  79  72
2  20  40  68  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 40 68 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes total valuation or balances valuations among agents. Here, we'll aim for a balanced allocation, where each agent gets at least one item if possible, and we try to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

### Valuations Table:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (21), Item 1 (97), Item 2 (91), Item 3 (53)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (61), Item 1 (99), Item 2 (79), Item 3 (72)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (20), Item 1 (40), Item 2 (68), Item 3 (83)

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Highest Valuation First:** Start by allocating items based on the highest valuations for each agent until all items are allocated.

2. **Balance Across Agents:** Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while maximizing their satisfaction.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 1 (highest value):** Agent 1 values Item 1 highest at 99. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   
2. **Item 2 (next highest):** Agent 0 values Item 2 at 91, which is higher than other agents' valuations. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 3 (next highest):** Agent 2 values Item 3 highest at 83. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 0 (remaining item):** Agent 1 values Item 0 at 61, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 0]
- Agent 2: [3]

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
