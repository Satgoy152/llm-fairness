Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  36   6  88
1  97  79   6  18
2  16  10  82  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents. We will look at the table of valuations and assign items such that the sum of the valuations is maximized while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item:** 
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 97 (highest).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 36 (highest).
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 82 (highest).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 88 (highest).

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Review the allocations:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 0.
   - Agent 2 receives Item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is maximized.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
