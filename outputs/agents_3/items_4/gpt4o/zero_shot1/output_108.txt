Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  11  36   0
1  75  38  89  57
2  45  24  74  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. One common approach is to use a version of the "maximum weight matching" algorithm in bipartite graphs, or simply assigning high-value items to agents with the highest valuations for those items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [37, 11, 36, 0]
- Agent 1's valuations: [75, 38, 89, 57]
- Agent 2's valuations: [45, 24, 74, 14]

A simple greedy approach could be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0: 37
   - Agent 1: 75
   - Agent 2: 45
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value: 75)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 11
   - Agent 1: 38
   - Agent 2: 24
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value: 38)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 36
   - Agent 1: 89
   - Agent 2: 74
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value: 89)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 0
   - Agent 1: 57
   - Agent 2: 14
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value: 57)

In this allocation, Agent 1 receives all the items since they have the highest valuation for each item. This is a straightforward approach based on maximizing valuations. However, if we want to ensure that not all items go to one agent and try to distribute items more evenly, we can consider slightly different allocations while still aiming to maximize the total value:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value: 75)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest value: 24, as Agent 1 already has Item 0)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value: 89)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (second-highest value: 0, as Agent 1 already has Item 0 and Item 2)

This setup provides a somewhat more balanced distribution, although not perfectly equal.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This distribution allows each agent to receive at least one item, maximizing overall satisfaction based on the highest available valuations for each item.
