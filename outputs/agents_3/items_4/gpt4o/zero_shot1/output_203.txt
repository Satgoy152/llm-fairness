Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  54   9  45  73
1  90  74  80  47
2  34  66  28  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. We'll analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 54, 9, 45, 73
Agent 1: 90, 74, 80, 47
Agent 2: 34, 66, 28, 33
```

One strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 66.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 80.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 73.

Based on this analysis, the allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most while ensuring all items are distributed.
