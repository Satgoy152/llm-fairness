Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  16  71  44
1  99  29  36  10
2  84  26  49  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach of maximizing the total valuation sum by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Evaluate each item for all agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 99, and Agent 2 at 84.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 at 29, and Agent 2 at 26.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 36, and Agent 2 at 49.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 at 10, and Agent 2 at 34.

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value of 99).
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value of 29).
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value of 71).
   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value of 44).

3. Make sure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 4.

The allocations based on the highest valuations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives no items.
