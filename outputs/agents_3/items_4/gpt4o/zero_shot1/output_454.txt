Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  69  70  64  66
1  35  97  71  45
2  75  23  35  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Let's start by looking at the highest value each agent has for any item:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 70.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 97.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 83.

2. Allocate these items based on the highest valuation:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the highest at 97.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it the highest at 83.

3. We have items 0 and 2 left to allocate. Let's look at their valuations:
   - Item 0:
     - Agent 0 values it at 69.
     - Agent 1 values it at 35.
     - Agent 2 values it at 75.
   - Item 2:
     - Agent 0 values it at 64.
     - Agent 1 values it at 71.
     - Agent 2 values it at 35.

4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it the highest at 75.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the highest at 71.

Following these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
