Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  11  22  84
1  34  74  22  37
2  77   0  88  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by considering each agent's preference or value for the items. We aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one.

Let's consider the values from the table:

- Agent 0 values: [54, 11, 22, 84]
- Agent 1 values: [34, 74, 22, 37]
- Agent 2 values: [77, 0, 88, 43]

We will start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't already been assigned. This approach aims to maximize the total value across all agents while considering fairness in allocation.

1. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 88), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (value 84), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 74), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
4. Now, only item 0 is left. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (value 77), so assign item 0 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent's preferences are considered while distributing the items fairly. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations for the items available.
