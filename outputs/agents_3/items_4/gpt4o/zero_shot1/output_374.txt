Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  78   8  89
1   7  20  13  16
2  17  78  66  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, considering each agent can receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 77, Item 1: 78, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 89

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 7, Item 1: 20, Item 2: 13, Item 3: 16

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 17, Item 1: 78, Item 2: 66, Item 3: 35

To maximize fairness, we'll consider each agent's highest valued items that are not already taken by another agent.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for Item 3 (89).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is for Item 1 (20) since Item 3 is already taken.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for Item 2 (66), and then Item 0 (17).

Since we have already allocated 3 items, we need to allocate one more item:

- **Agent 2** can also take Item 0 (17) since this is the only item left.

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Items 0 and 2.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
