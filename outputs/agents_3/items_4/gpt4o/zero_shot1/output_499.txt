Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  45  11  94
1  17  22  63  10
2  62  37  66  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value for all agents. Let's look at each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 36 (item 0), 45 (item 1), 11 (item 2), 94 (item 3).
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 17 (item 0), 22 (item 1), 63 (item 2), 10 (item 3).
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 62 (item 0), 37 (item 1), 66 (item 2), 19 (item 3).

We can try to allocate items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (94). So, allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (63). So, allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (62). So, allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Now we have one item left to allocate (item 1), which is valued by:

- Agent 0: 45
- Agent 1: 22
- Agent 2: 37

Item 1 should be allocated to agent 0, who values it the highest (45).

The allocations based on these decisions are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
