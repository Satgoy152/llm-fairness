Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  93   4  77  30
1  24   5  92  43
2  40  52  55  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the idea of maximizing total valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll try to assign the items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's review the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 24, Agent 2 at 40
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 at 5, Agent 2 at 52
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 92, Agent 2 at 55
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 43, Agent 2 at 27

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. Item 0 should go to Agent 0, as they value it the highest at 93.
2. Item 1 should go to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 52.
3. Item 2 should go to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 92.
4. Item 3 should go to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 43.

This allocation maximizes the sum of valuations and ensures that all items are distributed. Agent 0 gets one item, Agent 1 gets two items, and Agent 2 gets one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
