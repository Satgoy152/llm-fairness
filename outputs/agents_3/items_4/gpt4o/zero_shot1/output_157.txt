Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  45  96  46
1  27  13  75  13
2  81  45  44  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 3 agents and 4 items, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown to find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**'s valuations: [97, 45, 96, 46]
2. **Agent 1**'s valuations: [27, 13, 75, 13]
3. **Agent 2**'s valuations: [81, 45, 44, 28]

We aim to allocate items such that:
- Each agent is allocated at least one item.
- The total valuation is maximized.

Based on the valuations given:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 1.

To maximize fairness and valuation:
- Assign item 0 to **Agent 0** (highest valuation of 97).
- Assign item 2 to **Agent 1** (highest valuation of 75).
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 2** (valuation of 45).

This leaves item 3 available, which can go to **Agent 0** since it has the second-highest valuation from Agent 0 (46).

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is maximized across the board.
