Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  63  30  86
1  97  21  95  83
2  22  22  75  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to give each agent a reasonable share of the total value based on their respective valuations. Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [87, 63, 30, 86]
   - Highest value items: 0 and 3

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [97, 21, 95, 83]
   - Highest value items: 0 and 2

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [22, 22, 75, 46]
   - Highest value item: 2

Considering the above, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value of 87)
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3 (values of 95 and 83)
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (value of 22)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 4.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
