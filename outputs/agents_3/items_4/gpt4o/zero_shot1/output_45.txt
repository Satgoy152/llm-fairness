Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  54   2  13  78
1  68  60  47  70
2  53  53  36  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction or value. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them to the agent who values them the most:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - *Allocate to Agent 1* (68 is the highest value)

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 2
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - *Allocate to Agent 1* (60 is the highest value)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 47
   - Agent 2 values it at 36
   - *Allocate to Agent 1* (47 is the highest value)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 67
   - *Allocate to Agent 0* (78 is the highest value)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
