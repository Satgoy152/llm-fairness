Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  78  63  53
1  34  44  68  22
2  20   9  30  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value based on the agents' preferences. Let's attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Evaluate the total valuations**: Review the valuation table provided to assess the value each agent places on each item.

2. **Assign the highest values**: Start by assigning items based on the highest valuations to make the allocation fair and to maximize total satisfaction.

3. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items**: Since there are 4 items and 3 agents, one agent will end up with 2 items, and the others with 1 item each.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (90), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (68), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 1 (78), assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (14), assign item 3 to agent 2.

This allocation maximizes total value and ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
