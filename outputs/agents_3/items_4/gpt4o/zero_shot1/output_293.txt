Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  18  92  61
1  66  37  10  73
2  78   2  29  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [43, 18, 92, 61]
   - Highest value item for Agent 0: Item 2 (value 92)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [66, 37, 10, 73]
   - Highest value item for Agent 1: Item 3 (value 73)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [78, 2, 29, 97]
   - Highest value item for Agent 2: Item 3 (value 97), but Agent 1 has a higher preference for Item 3. Next highest for Agent 2 is Item 0 (value 78).

Now that we have identified the highest value items for each agent, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair allocation, considering their next best preferences if conflicts arise.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 92)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 73)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (value 78)

Now, we have 3 items allocated: Items 0, 2, and 3. The remaining item (Item 1) should be allocated to the agent who would benefit the most from it, without reducing the overall fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Remaining preference for Item 1 is 18
- **Agent 1**: Remaining preference for Item 1 is 37
- **Agent 2**: Remaining preference for Item 1 is 2

Item 1 should go to Agent 1 because it gives them the highest additional value.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on each agent's preferences while attempting to maximize the total value received by each agent.
