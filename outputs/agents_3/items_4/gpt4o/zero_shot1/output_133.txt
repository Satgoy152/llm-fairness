Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  53  90  56
1  39   5   3  95
2  43  71  30  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one common approach is to try maximizing the total valuation for all agents or ensuring that each agent is getting items they value most. Here's a step-by-step approach to consider:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [19, 53, 90, 56]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [39, 5, 3, 95]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [43, 71, 30, 32]

### Allocation Strategy:

- Start by allocating the highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet to any agent.
- Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
- Allocate items that provide the highest value to each respective agent.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 2 → Allocate item 2.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is for item 3 → Allocate item 3.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for item 1 → Allocate item 1.

Now, the only remaining item is item 0.

4. **Allocate the remaining item 0**:
   - Among agents, agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 39) compared to agent 0 (value 19) and agent 2 (value 43).

Thus, the fair allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their highest preferences, balancing value distribution among them. Note that item 0 was given to agent 2 instead of agent 1 since agent 2 only received one item earlier.
