Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  30  41  27
1   8  83  20  54
2  22  21  44   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can look for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 (87), Item 1 (30), Item 2 (41), Item 3 (27)
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 (8), Item 1 (83), Item 2 (20), Item 3 (54)
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 (22), Item 1 (21), Item 2 (44), Item 3 (9)

A fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation by Agent 2)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation by Agent 1)

This allocation respects the preference of each agent for at least one item and ensures all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
