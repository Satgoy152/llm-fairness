Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  91  42  92
1  79  74  79  42
2  69  13  34   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the value each agent assigns to each item and try to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 92

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 42

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 7

A possible strategy is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to any of the items, while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

1. **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0, who values it the highest at 92.
2. **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 1, who values it the highest at 79.
3. **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 2, who values it at 34, which is higher than any other unallocated item.
4. **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 0, who values it at 91, the highest among remaining options.

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 4 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
