Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  78   1  21
1  41  72  95  40
2  27  66  39  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's evaluate the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  82  78   1  21
1  41  72  95  40
2  27  66  39  80
```

The goal is to allocate all 4 items. Let's consider the highest valuations for each item and try to distribute them fairly among the agents:

1. Item 0 has the highest value (82) for agent 0.
2. Item 1 has the highest value (78) for agent 0, but to distribute items fairly, we consider agent 2, who values it at 66.
3. Item 2 has the highest value (95) for agent 1.
4. Item 3 has the highest value (80) for agent 2.

By allocating based on these considerations, we have:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
