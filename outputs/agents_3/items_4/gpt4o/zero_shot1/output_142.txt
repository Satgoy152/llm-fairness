Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  17  46  94
1  17  83  95   4
2  74  89  32  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A straightforward approach to this problem is to ensure that the items are distributed to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 89, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 95, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 89, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 94 (after already getting item 0), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.

Thus, the allocations can be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
