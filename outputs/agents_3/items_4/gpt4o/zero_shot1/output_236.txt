Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  70   3  66  15
1  28  76   7  67
2  56   5  60  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation from their allocated items is as high as possible.

Let's analyze the values and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** 
   - Item 0: 70
   - Item 1: 3
   - Item 2: 66
   - Item 3: 15

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 28
   - Item 1: 76
   - Item 2: 7
   - Item 3: 67

3. **Agent 2's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 56
   - Item 1: 5
   - Item 2: 60
   - Item 3: 99

To maximize fairness and overall satisfaction, we should aim to allocate items to agents based on the highest unique valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0** (value 70 is the highest for Agent 0 and relatively high compared to others)
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1** (value 76 is the highest for Agent 1)
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2** (value 60 is higher than Agent 0's and Agent 1's valuation of this item)
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2** (value 99 is highest overall, and Agent 2 has already been allocated one item)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total value received by the agents.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
