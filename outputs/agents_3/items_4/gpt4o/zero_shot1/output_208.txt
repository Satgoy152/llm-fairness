Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  55  43  38
1  63  42  62  68
2  53  38  67  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. A common method for achieving this is by using a greedy approach or evaluating potential allocations for the highest total valuation.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [26, 55, 43, 38]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [63, 42, 62, 68]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [53, 38, 67, 16]

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Assign the highest-valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (55).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (68).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (67).

2. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - Item 0 is left and has the following valuations:
     - Agent 0: 26
     - Agent 1: 63
     - Agent 2: 53
   - The highest value for item 0 is with Agent 1 (63).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that the total valuation is maximized and each agent receives at least one item.

### JSON Format Allocation:

{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
