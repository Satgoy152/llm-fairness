Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  12   5  72  73
1  26  88   5  95
2  48  46  61  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and each item is allocated to exactly one agent. The goal is to make sure that the allocation is fair and optimal based on the given valuations.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it higher (26) compared to agents 0 (12) and 2 (48).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it highest (88) compared to agent 0 (5) and agent 2 (46).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highest (72) compared to agent 1 (5) and agent 2 (61).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it highest (98) compared to agent 0 (73) and agent 1 (95).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and each item is allocated. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent given the possible allocations.
