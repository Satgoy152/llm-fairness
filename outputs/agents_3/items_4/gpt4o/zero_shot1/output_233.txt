Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  35  51  54
1  99  20  63  82
2  32  26  70  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 20 63 82]
 [32 26 70 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value. We might consider using a method like the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents are on one side and items are on the other, with edges weighted by the valuation.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [71, 35, 51, 54]
- Agent 1: [99, 20, 63, 82]
- Agent 2: [32, 26, 70, 86]

One possible allocation to maximize fairness and total value could be:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 99, highest value for item 0).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 35, since Agent 1 already got item 0, and Agent 0 values item 1 higher than Agent 2).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 70, highest value for item 2).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 86, highest value for item 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and it fairly distributes the items based on the values.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
