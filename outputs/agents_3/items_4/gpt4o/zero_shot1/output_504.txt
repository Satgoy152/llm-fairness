Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  37  48  64
1  26  31  35  38
2  31  18  74  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 31 35 38]
 [31 18 74 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent. We will try to assign items to agents such that the sum of their valuations is maximized, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [89, 37, 48, 64]
- Agent 1 values: [26, 31, 35, 38]
- Agent 2 values: [31, 18, 74, 65]

A possible fair allocation while maximizing the total value is:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 89, highest for this item)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 37, highest for this item)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 74, highest for this item)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 65, second highest, but Agent 0 already has 2 items)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
