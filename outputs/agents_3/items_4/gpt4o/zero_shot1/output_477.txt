Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  72  63  33
1  72  19   0  68
2  57  55  47  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items. This helps to understand which agent values the items more overall.
   
   - Agent 0: 31 + 72 + 63 + 33 = 199
   - Agent 1: 72 + 19 + 0 + 68 = 159
   - Agent 2: 57 + 55 + 47 + 40 = 199

2. **Item Allocation**: Assign items one by one to the agents who value them the most, checking each item's value across agents.

3. **Item 0 Allocation**: 
   - Agent 0: 31
   - Agent 1: 72 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 57
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 1 Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: 72 (highest)
   - Agent 1: 19
   - Agent 2: 55
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 2 Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: 63 (highest)
   - Agent 1: 0
   - Agent 2: 47
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 3 Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: 33
   - Agent 1: 68 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 40
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring an integer number of items per agent and exactly 4 items allocated overall.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
