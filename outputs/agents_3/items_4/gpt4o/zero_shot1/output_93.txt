Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  91  76  79
1  30  85  40  45
2  16  12  86  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the 4 items among the 3 agents in such a way that the total value is maximized and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [0, 91, 76, 79]
- Agent 1: [30, 85, 40, 45]
- Agent 2: [16, 12, 86, 65]

One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Assign to Agent 1 (value 30)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 91
   - Agent 1 values it at 85
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - Assign to Agent 0 (value 91)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - Assign to Agent 2 (value 86)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Assign to Agent 0 (value 79)

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3]
- Agent 1 gets item [0]
- Agent 2 gets item [2]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
