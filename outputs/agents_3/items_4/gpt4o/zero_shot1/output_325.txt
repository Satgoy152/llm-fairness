Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  17  22   4
1   5  78  73   1
2  22  76  11  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's analyze the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 4

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 1

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 11
  - Item 3: 24

Let's allocate the items to maximize valuations and ensure each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1, which is 78. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 3, which is 24. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2, which is 22. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. For Item 0, Agent 2 has the highest valuation at 22, but since Agent 2 already has an item, we can consider Agent 0, who values it at 18. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
