Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  11  17  43
1  85  94  22  24
2  11  84  70  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 94 22 24]
 [11 84 70 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method, where we aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation sum for all agents.

Given the valuation matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  37  11  17  43
1  85  94  22  24
2  11  84  70  53
```

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 37
   - Item 1: 11
   - Item 2: 17
   - Item 3: 43

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 85
   - Item 1: 94
   - Item 2: 22
   - Item 3: 24

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 11
   - Item 1: 84
   - Item 2: 70
   - Item 3: 53

A possible allocation could be:
- Assign the item with the highest valuation to the corresponding agent if it's not already assigned.

Let's allocate based on the highest individual valuations:
- Agent 1 gets Item 1 (value 94)
- Agent 0 gets Item 3 (value 43)
- Agent 2 gets Item 2 (value 70)
- Agent 1 gets Item 0 (value 85)

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent gets from their most valued items.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
