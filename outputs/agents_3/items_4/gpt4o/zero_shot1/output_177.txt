Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  72  86  75
1  72  25  50  57
2  54  97  62  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value or ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly. Let's break it down:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 66, 72, 86, 75
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** 72, 25, 50, 57
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** 54, 97, 62, 44

To ensure a fair allocation, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (86).
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (72).
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (97).

This allocation ensures each agent gets one of their highest-valued items. For the remaining item, item 3:

- Assign item 3 to **Agent 0** as they have a relatively high valuation for it (75), maximizing their overall value.

By doing this, we ensure each agent receives at least one item they value highly. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
