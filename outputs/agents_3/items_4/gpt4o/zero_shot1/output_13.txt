Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  48  62  22
1  78  56  56  88
2  20   0  34  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [83, 48, 62, 22]
Agent 1: [78, 56, 56, 88]
Agent 2: [20, 0, 34, 76]
```

To maximize fairness, we can use the "maximum sum of minimum values" approach or a similar strategy to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach for this specific problem:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (83).
2. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (88).
3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: After item 0, Agent 0 values item 2 the second highest (62).
4. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: After item 3, Agent 1 values item 1 the second highest (56).

Agent 2 receives no items because their valuations are generally lower compared to other agents for the items prioritized.

Final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
