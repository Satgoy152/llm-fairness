Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  75   8  99
1  44   8  14  18
2   6  15  41   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent can have at most 4 items in total. Let's consider the valuations given in the table:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 1
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 99

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 44
- Item 1: 8
- Item 2: 14
- Item 3: 18

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 6
- Item 1: 15
- Item 2: 41
- Item 3: 3

To maximize the total value and allocate all items fairly, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest (99).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as well, as Agent 0 values it the highest (75).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest (44).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest (41).

This allocation ensures that the total valuation is maximized, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
