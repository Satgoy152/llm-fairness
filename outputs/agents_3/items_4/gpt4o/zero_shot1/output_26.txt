Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  15  51  34
1  45  72  97  53
2  20  29   8  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each receives at least one item. Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  95  15  51  34
1  45  72  97  53
2  20  29   8  32
```

We need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 0 (95).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is for item 2 (97).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (32).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, we have allocated items 0, 2, and 3. We have one more item to allocate (item 1).

4. Review remaining item:
   - Item 1: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 15.
     - Agent 1 values it at 72.
     - Agent 2 values it at 29.
   - Item 1 should go to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation for it.

This allocation seems to be a fair distribution based on the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
