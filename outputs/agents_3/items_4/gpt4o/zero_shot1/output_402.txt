Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  86   4  15
1  38  61  19  91
2  78   3  44   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use a method that ensures each agent's allocation is optimized based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (96), Item 1 (86), Item 2 (4), Item 3 (15)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (38), Item 1 (61), Item 2 (19), Item 3 (91)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (78), Item 1 (3), Item 2 (44), Item 3 (7)

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 96.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 86.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 44.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 91.

3. **Check Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 0 and Item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 3.
   - Agent 2 receives Item 2.

This allocation maximizes each agent's valuation based on their highest preferences and ensures all items are assigned.

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
