Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  11  69  54
1  39  24  58  28
2   8  41  60  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate each agent's highest valued items and distribute the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 69, followed by item 0 at 66.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 58, followed by item 0 at 39.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 72, followed by item 2 at 60.

Based on these valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest overall.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest overall.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 0 already received a high-value item (item 2), and Agent 1 values item 0 second highest after item 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, since they have the next highest value for their second item.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of their valued items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items while maximizing the total value received by each agent as much as possible under these constraints.
