Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  72  84  24
1  56   0  18  71
2  69  27  36  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item, if possible. We can start by examining the highest valuation each agent has for any item and try to allocate the items accordingly.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 24

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 71

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 27

We'll start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent and then distribute the remaining items in a way that balances the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 84), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 71), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 69), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Now we have assigned three items, and only item 1 remains unallocated. We look at the remaining valuations for item 1:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 72
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 0
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 27

Since agent 0 values item 1 the highest, we will allocate item 1 to agent 0.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
