Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  43  20  53
1  61  34  19  99
2  90  58  88  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll start by assigning the highest value items to each agent based on their preferences and try to ensure a balanced distribution.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 53. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 99, but since it's already assigned, we look at the next highest which is item 0 with a value of 61. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 90, but it's already taken, so we assign the next highest, item 2 with a value of 88, to agent 2.

Now, each agent has one item, and there is one item left (item 1).

4. Consider the remaining item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Agent 2 values it at 58.

Since agent 2 values item 1 the highest, assign item 1 to agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the agents' preferences.
