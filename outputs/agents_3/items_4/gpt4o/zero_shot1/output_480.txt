Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  34  95  86
1  28   8  39  88
2  84  28  81  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider using a strategy like maximizing the total valuation for the agents, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the valuations for each item by the agents**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 values it at 28, Agent 2 values it at 84.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 8, Agent 2 values it at 28.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 39, Agent 2 values it at 81.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 88, Agent 2 values it at 91.

2. **Assign the items based on highest valuation**:
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 2 (value 84 is the highest).
   - Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (value 34 is the highest).
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 0 (value 95 is the highest).
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (value 88 is the highest).

3. **Check the allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2].
   - Agent 1 gets item [3].
   - Agent 2 gets item [0].

4. **Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item**:
   - All 4 items are allocated.
   - Each agent has at least one item.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
