Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  47   9  46
1  57  17  39  58
2  74  78  24  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [85, 47, 9, 46]
- Agent 1 values: [57, 17, 39, 58]
- Agent 2 values: [74, 78, 24, 37]

We will aim to maximize the individual satisfaction by considering one item at a time and assigning it to the agent who values it the most, without repeating allocations.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   
   Agent 0 values it the most (85).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 47
   - Agent 1 values it at 17
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   
   Agent 2 values it the most (78).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   
   Agent 1 values it the most (39).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 37
   
   Agent 1 values it the most (58).

With this approach, each agent receives items that maximize their respective valuations, given the constraints. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
