Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  84  70  34
1  63  88  95  10
2  83  70  94  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can consider maximizing the sum of values assigned to each agent for the items they receive.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. Assign the items based on the highest valuations:

   - Agent 0 values: [77, 84, 70, 34]
   - Agent 1 values: [63, 88, 95, 10]
   - Agent 2 values: [83, 70, 94, 65]

2. Let's allocate items to maximize the total valuation:

   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (95).
   - Item 1 has the next highest value for Agent 1 (88).
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (83).
   - Item 3 can be allocated to Agent 0 (34), since agents 1 and 2 already have more valuable items.

This allocation achieves a fair distribution while maximizing the overall value for each agent.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
