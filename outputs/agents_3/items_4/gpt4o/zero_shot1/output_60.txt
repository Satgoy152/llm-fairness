Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  34  60  63
1  48   5  58  81
2  40  52  59  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 34 60 63]
 [48  5 58 81]
 [40 52 59 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the preferences and valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [93, 34, 60, 63]
- Agent 1's valuations: [48, 5, 58, 81]
- Agent 2's valuations: [40, 52, 59, 41]

A reasonable allocation, aiming for fairness and maximizing valuations, could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation of 93)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuation of 81)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (valuation of 52)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valuation of 60)

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest available valuations, while also distributing the items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
