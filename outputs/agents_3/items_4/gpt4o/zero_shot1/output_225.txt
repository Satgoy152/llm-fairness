Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  31  99  66
1  75  48  57  44
2  29  58  53  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. One approach is to try to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and the overall valuation is maximized.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [28, 31, 99, 66]
- Agent 1 values: [75, 48, 57, 44]
- Agent 2 values: [29, 58, 53, 54]

We can attempt to allocate items to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 99) - highest value item for Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 75) - highest value item for Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 58) - highest value item for Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 66) - second highest available value for Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to maximize the sum of valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [1]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
