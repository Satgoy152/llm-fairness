Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  99  53  63
1  37  44  90  29
2  97  60  36   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We have three agents and four items in the table. We will first assign the item to the agent who values it the most and then manage remaining allocations to ensure fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 63

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 29

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 9

From this, we can derive the following initial allocations based on highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (97 is the highest)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (99 is the highest)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (90 is the highest)
- Item 3 is left, and we need to ensure that each agent gets an item. Since Agent 2 has already received an item, we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (as 63 is higher than Agent 1's 29).

Thus, the allocation ensuring each agent gets at least one item and maximizing individual valuations is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total allocation maximizes the overall value based on the given valuations.
