Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  38  66   8
1  73  48  39  18
2  76   6  66  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive. Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 8

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 18

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 50

To maximize fairness, we can try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, if possible:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2 (66). 
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 (73).
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 3 (50).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (item 1):

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 38.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 48.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 6.

The highest valuation for item 1 is by Agent 1, so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocations will be:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
