Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  39  83  28
1  83   7  20  38
2  91  44  89  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2. However, item 2 is also highly valued by Agent 2. 
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0, which is also highly valued by Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. 

Considering these valuations, here's a potential allocation:

- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This is one of Agent 0's highest-valued items and avoids conflict with Agent 2's top choice, item 3.
- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1**: While Agent 1 values item 0 highly, itâ€™s also highly valued by Agent 2. Given Agent 1's overall lower valuations, this allocation gives them a fair share.
- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2**: This is Agent 2's highest-valued item.
- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 2**: This gives Agent 2 another item, balancing their overall allocation.

After considering the valuations and aiming for fairness, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items aligned with their respective valuations.
