Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  81  67  40
1  65  42  93  19
2   3   3  37  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for each item. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated.

Here's how we can allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 65.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 81.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 93.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 65.

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
