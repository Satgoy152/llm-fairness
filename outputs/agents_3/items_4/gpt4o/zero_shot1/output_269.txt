Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  57   1  18
1  68  64  91  27
2  52  37  20  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and aim to maximize the total value or ensure that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's consider the following allocations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (57) among the items available to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (91) among all agents.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (60) among all agents.
4. Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (68) after item 2 is allocated.

This leads to the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

These allocations ensure that each item is allocated and that the agents receive items according to their highest valuations relative to the other agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
