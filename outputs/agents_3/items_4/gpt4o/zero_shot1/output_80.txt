Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  81  25  93
1   1  31  49  69
2  37  26   8  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, given their individual valuations. We will consider each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [24, 81, 25, 93]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (93)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [1, 31, 49, 69]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (69) but already considered for Agent 0. Next highest is Item 2 (49).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [37, 26, 8, 49]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (37)

Based on the above, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.

For the remaining item, Item 1:

- Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 31, and Agent 2 at 26. The highest valuation is by Agent 0.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
