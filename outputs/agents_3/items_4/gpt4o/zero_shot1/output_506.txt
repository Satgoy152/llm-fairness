Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  53  77  82
1   5  53  59  56
2  39  36  13  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (value 82). 
   - Next highest value for agent 0 is item 2 (value 77).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 59). However, since item 2 is more valuable to Agent 0, we consider other items.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 next (value 53).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value 81). However, since item 3 is more valuable to Agent 0, we consider other items.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 next (value 39).

Given these considerations, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0** gets items 3 and 2.
- **Agent 1** gets item 1.
- **Agent 2** gets item 0.

This allocation considers the highest valuation for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items. The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
