Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  17  37  40  71
1  10  86  61  13
2  90   1  13  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 4. A common approach is to maximize the total value of the allocations or to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 71

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 13

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 10

To allocate the items, let's try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest valued items first and ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

1. Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest (90). We'll allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (86). We'll allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (71). We'll allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
4. The remaining item is Item 2. Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (61), so we can allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the agents' valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
