Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  78  26  18
1  31  90  66  43
2  24   0  53  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 78.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest remaining value for Agent 1, after item 1 is taken, is item 2 with a value of 66.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest remaining value for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 24.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item**:
   - The only remaining item is item 3.
   - Compare the values for item 3 among all agents:
     - Agent 0 has a value of 18.
     - Agent 1 has a value of 43.
     - Agent 2 has a value of 16.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they have the highest value for it.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
