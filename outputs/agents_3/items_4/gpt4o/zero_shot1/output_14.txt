Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  46  90  31
1  64  18  45  44
2  85  91  32  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. In this scenario, we need to distribute the 4 items in a way that seems equitable based on the provided valuations.

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [90, 46, 90, 31]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [64, 18, 45, 44]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [85, 91, 32, 15]

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (valuation of 90 is the highest)
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2 (valuation of 91 is the highest)
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0 (valuation of 90 is the highest for remaining choices)
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 1 (valuation of 44 is the highest for remaining choices)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and the total value is distributed reasonably given the constraints.
