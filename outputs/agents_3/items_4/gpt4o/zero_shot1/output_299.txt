Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  67   5  17
1  19  38   5  83
2  17  73  64  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 0 highly (75), followed by item 1 (67).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values item 3 the most (83), followed by item 1 (38).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values item 3 (75) and item 1 (73) highly.

Let's make an allocation attempt:

- **Agent 0** gets item 0, as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 1** gets item 3, as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2** gets item 1, as it is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 2, but Agent 2 has a higher valuation for it compared to Agent 0's second choice.
- **Agent 2** also gets item 2, as it is the next available item and Agent 2 values it significantly higher than the others.

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their highest preferences. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
