Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3
0  40   8  24  74
1  61  33  17  91
2  39  44  96  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 33 17 91]
 [39 44 96 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent. A fair allocation might not always maximize total valuation but will focus on ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value reasonably.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [40, 8, 24, 74]
Agent 1: [61, 33, 17, 91]
Agent 2: [39, 44, 96, 90]
```

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring fairness by rotating among agents when possible:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 61.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 44.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.

This allocation would result in Agent 2 getting two items, which might not seem fair based on the requirement to give each agent a fair share. We can adjust:

1. Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (61).
2. Item 1: Assign to Agent 2 (44).
3. Item 2: Assign to Agent 0 (24) - since Agent 2 will get item 1.
4. Item 3: Assign to Agent 2 (90).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item. Now, let's represent the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total of 4 items is allocated.
