Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  15  92   7
1  28   4  49  10
2  96  28  38  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations. Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  64  15  92   7
1  28   4  49  10
2  96  28  38  56
```

We can proceed by evaluating the highest value an agent places on each item and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64.
   - Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - Agent 2 values it at 96.
   - **Assign item 0 to agent 2** (highest value is 96).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 15.
   - Agent 1 values it at 4.
   - Agent 2 values it at 28.
   - **Assign item 1 to agent 2** (highest value is 28).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Agent 1 values it at 49.
   - Agent 2 values it at 38.
   - **Assign item 2 to agent 0** (highest value is 92).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7.
   - Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Agent 2 values it at 56.
   - **Assign item 3 to agent 2** (highest value is 56).

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on the highest valuations for fairness among the agents.
