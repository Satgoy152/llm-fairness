Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  29  15  80  83
1  91  14  89   7
2  47  22  54  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation by assigning items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly relative to other agents. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Evaluate the valuations:**  
   We have the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: [29, 15, 80, 83]
   - Agent 1: [91, 14, 89, 7]
   - Agent 2: [47, 22, 54, 51]

2. **Determine the highest value for each item across all agents:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 22.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.

3. **Assign items to agents based on highest valuations:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 91).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 22).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 89).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 83).

4. **Ensure all items are allocated and each agent is considered:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 2 gets Item 1.

With these allocations, all items are distributed, and each agent receives the item(s) they value the most among the available options.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
