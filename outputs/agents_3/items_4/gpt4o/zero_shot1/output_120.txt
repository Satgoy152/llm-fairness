Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  15  17  58
1  61  79  74  64
2  40  49  85  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 79 74 64]
 [40 49 85 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Analyze Valuations
- **Agent 0**: Values are [36, 15, 17, 58]
- **Agent 1**: Values are [61, 79, 74, 64]
- **Agent 2**: Values are [40, 49, 85, 20]

### Step 2: Find Optimal Allocation
We want to maximize the total value for each agent given the constraint that each agent should get at least one item.

1. **Allocate item 3** to **Agent 0**: Highest value at 58.
2. **Allocate item 1** to **Agent 1**: Highest value at 79.
3. **Allocate item 2** to **Agent 2**: Highest value at 85.
4. For **item 0**, since it has not been allocated yet, we consider the next highest value:
   - **Agent 1** values it at 61, which is higher compared to others.

### Step 3: Final Allocation
- **Agent 0** gets item [3]
- **Agent 1** gets items [1, 0]
- **Agent 2** gets item [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the total value for each agent.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
