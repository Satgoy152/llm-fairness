Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  52  52  74
1  87  63  89  82
2   0  67  15   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items assigned to them. Let's evaluate the valuations provided for each item by the agents and then decide on an allocation that maximizes fairness in terms of value.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 87, Agent 2 values it at 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 63, Agent 2 values it at 67.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 89, Agent 2 values it at 15.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 82, Agent 2 values it at 3.

Let's allocate the items to the agents based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0 should go to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 87).
2. Item 1 should go to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 67).
3. Item 2 should go to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 89).
4. Item 3 should go to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 74).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
