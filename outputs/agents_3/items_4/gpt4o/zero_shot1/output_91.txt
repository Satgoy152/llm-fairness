Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  35   8  88
1  96  17  62  40
2  84  41  62  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We'll consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them fairly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (value = 88).
   - Second highest is item 1 (value = 35).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (value = 96).
   - Second highest is item 2 (value = 62).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (value = 84) (but it's already allocated to Agent 1).
   - Second highest is item 2 (value = 62).

Let's allocate based on this:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Now only item 1 is left. Since agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1, we allocate it to agent 0.

Therefore, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
