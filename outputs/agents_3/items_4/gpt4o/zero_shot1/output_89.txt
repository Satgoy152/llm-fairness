Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  86  88  14
1  55  34  16  50
2  42  42  89  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [74, 86, 88, 14]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 88)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [55, 34, 16, 50]
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 55)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [42, 42, 89, 84]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 89), but since Item 2 is already allocated, choose the next highest available item: Item 3 (value 84)

Now, allocate the remaining item:

- Item 1 is still unallocated. Between Agent 0 and Agent 1, Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (value 86), so it should be allocated to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3

The JSON allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
