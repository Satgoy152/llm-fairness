Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  76  17  48
1  84  26  68  19
2  89  19  75  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [48, 76, 17, 48]
   - Highest value is for item 1 (value 76).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [84, 26, 68, 19]
   - Highest value is for item 0 (value 84).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [89, 19, 75, 76]
   - Highest value is for item 0 (value 89), but it's already taken by Agent 1.
   - Second highest value is for item 2 (value 75).

Now, we have assigned:
- Item 1 to Agent 0
- Item 0 to Agent 1
- Item 2 to Agent 2

The remaining item is item 3. We need to allocate it to one of the agents. Let's consider the second highest values for the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has a value of 48 for item 3.
- Agent 1 has a value of 19 for item 3.
- Agent 2 has a value of 76 for item 3.

Since Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3, we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2. 

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
