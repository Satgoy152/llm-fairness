Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  17   9  13
1  58  31  17  69
2   7  38  89  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents based on their valuations. Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [52, 17, 9, 13]
- Agent 1: [58, 31, 17, 69]
- Agent 2: [7, 38, 89, 92]

One common approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most. In this case, we will allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation by Agent 1 (58).
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (38).
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (89).
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (92).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: No items are allocated because Agent 0 does not have the highest valuation for any item.
- Agent 1: Item 0 is allocated.
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, and 3 are allocated.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each item by assigning it to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
