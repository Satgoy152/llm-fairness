Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  60  82  70
1   8   8  96  10
2  56  57  16  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations. Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 3, Item 1 = 60, Item 2 = 82, Item 3 = 70
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 8, Item 1 = 8, Item 2 = 96, Item 3 = 10
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 = 56, Item 1 = 57, Item 2 = 16, Item 3 = 73

To allocate the items:

1. **Assign Item 2** to Agent 1: Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest at 96.
2. **Assign Item 3** to Agent 2: Agent 2 values Item 3 the highest at 73.
3. **Assign Item 1** to Agent 0: Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 60.
4. **Assign Item 0** to Agent 2: Agent 2 values Item 0 second highest at 56, and Agent 0 values it the lowest at 3.

Given these allocations, each agent gets at least one item, and their highest or second-highest valued items are assigned to them, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the values provided.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
