Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  34  91  54
1   7  28  95  60
2  38  63  51  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to ensure a sense of fairness, possibly by maximizing the total valuation or ensuring that each agent receives items that they value relatively higher compared to the others.

Here's the valuations table for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  15  34  91  54
1   7  28  95  60
2  38  63  51  63
```

Let's analyze the valuations to find an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values item 2 the most at 91.
   - Next highest is item 3 with a value of 54.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values item 2 the most at 95.
   - Next highest is item 3 with a value of 60.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values item 1 the most at 63.
   - Similarly, values item 3 the same at 63.

To distribute the items fairly, we need to balance individual preferences and overall value:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it highest among all agents.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, since they value it the highest.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, since Agent 1 already received item 2, and Agent 0 values it next highest.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it gives Agent 2 a second item and helps balance the allocation.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences and the total number of items available.
