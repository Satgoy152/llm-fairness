Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  81  91  49
1  14  49  48  38
2  70  69   9  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value received by all agents. Here is one possible allocation approach using the given valuations:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 67
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 91
- Item 3: 49

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 14
- Item 1: 49
- Item 2: 48
- Item 3: 38

Agent 2 values:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 9
- Item 3: 59

Let's allocate items based on the highest value for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (70)
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (81)
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (91)
4. Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (59)

Now we have to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is fair. Let's adjust the allocation:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 2
- Give Item 1 to Agent 0
- Give Item 2 to Agent 0
- Give Item 3 to Agent 1

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total value distribution fairly.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
