Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  25  97  58
1  35   3  90  28
2  87  95   4  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Here's a reasonable allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to any available item.
2. Assign the highest valued item to the respective agent, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Let's break down the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest with a value of 97.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest with a value of 90, but item 2 is already allocated to agent 0. The next highest is item 0 at 35.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest with a value of 95.

Allocations based on the above analysis:
- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 also values item 3 with 58, which is the next highest available value for unallocated items.

Thus, the allocations will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
