Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  46   3  87
1  85  46  15  12
2  16  71  83  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 87

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 12

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 83

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 87.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 85.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 83.

This allocation covers three items. Now we need to allocate the remaining item (item 1):

- Agent 2 values item 1 at 71, which is the highest remaining value for this item compared to Agent 0 (46) and Agent 1 (46).

Thus, a fair allocation of items based on maximum preferences would be:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
