Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  45  24  80
1  93  96  22  11
2  75  58  61  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have three agents and four items to allocate.

Let's examine the valuations to find an allocation that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 80

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 11

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 40

A possible allocation strategy is to allocate each item to the agent who values it most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 (value 93) values Item 0 the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 (value 96) values Item 1 the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 (value 61) values Item 2 the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (value 80) values Item 3 the highest.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 2.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
