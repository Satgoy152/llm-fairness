Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  20  12  30
1  25  26  53   9
2  59  63  55  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. There are 3 agents and 4 items, so one agent will receive 2 items while the other two agents will receive 1 item each. We will consider the valuations provided and try to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [34, 20, 12, 30]
- Agent 1 values items as: [25, 26, 53, 9]
- Agent 2 values items as: [59, 63, 55, 77]

We will allocate the items based on the highest values first:

1. Agent 2 highly values item 3 at 77, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
2. Agent 2 also values item 1 highly at 63, the next highest value available, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. Now, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest values:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 53; allocate item 2 to agent 1.
   - The only remaining item is item 0, which agent 0 values at 34; allocate item 0 to agent 0.

This allocation results in each agent receiving items in a way that maximizes their valuation based on the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
