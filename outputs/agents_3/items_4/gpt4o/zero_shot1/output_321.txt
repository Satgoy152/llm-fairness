Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  61  14  70
1   1  67  84  76
2  99  56  20  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have 3 agents and 4 items. Let's consider different allocations to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values: 83, 61, 14, 70

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: 1, 67, 84, 76

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: 99, 56, 20, 14

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 83)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 84)
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 56)
- Agent 2 also gets item 3 (value 14)

This allocation considers the highest value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
