Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  93   8  54  35
1  35  70  10  18
2  49  53  79  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations given in the table. The goal is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.
4. For item 3, Agent 0 and Agent 2 have relatively close valuations, but Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2. Hence, it's reasonable to assign item 3 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 has a lower total from the first two allocations.

Let's allocate the items as follows:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total valuation is balanced.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
