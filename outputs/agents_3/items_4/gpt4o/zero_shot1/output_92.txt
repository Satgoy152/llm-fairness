Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  41  81  31
1  67  96  60  64
2  74  65  51  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction or utility across all agents. We can start by evaluating which agent values each item the most and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [8, 41, 81, 31]
Agent 1: [67, 96, 60, 64]
Agent 2: [74, 65, 51, 57]
```

### Analysis:
- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 8
  - Agent 1 values it at 67
  - Agent 2 values it at 74
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 41
  - Agent 1 values it at 96
  - Agent 2 values it at 65
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 81
  - Agent 1 values it at 60
  - Agent 2 values it at 51
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 31
  - Agent 1 values it at 64
  - Agent 2 values it at 57
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

### Allocation:
The allocation based on maximizing total satisfaction is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, while keeping the overall allocations fair by distributing items according to each agentâ€™s highest-valued preferences. Each agent receives at least one item, and all four items are allocated.
