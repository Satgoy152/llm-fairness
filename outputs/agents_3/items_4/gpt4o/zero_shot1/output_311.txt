Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  45  36  39
1  19  52  81  92
2  86  69  19  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use a method like the Hungarian algorithm or a greedy approach. Here's a simple allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items: Item 0 (value 60), Item 1 (value 45).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation item: Item 3 (value 92).
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation item: Item 2 (value 19).

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation that maximizes the valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all four items are distributed, each agent receives items, and the total valuation is reasonably high for each agent.
