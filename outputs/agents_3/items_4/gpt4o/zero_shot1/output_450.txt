Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0   5   0  60  87
1  99  64  51  38
2  12  42  92  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Let's evaluate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 - 5, Item 1 - 0, Item 2 - 60, Item 3 - 87
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 - 99, Item 1 - 64, Item 2 - 51, Item 3 - 38
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 - 12, Item 1 - 42, Item 2 - 92, Item 3 - 51

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 3 with a valuation of 87.
2. Agent 1 highly values Item 0 with a valuation of 99.
3. Agent 2 highly values Item 2 with a valuation of 92.

Now, we have allocated Items 0, 2, and 3. There is one item left to allocate, which is Item 1. Let's see which agent has the next highest valuation for Item 1:

- Agent 1 values Item 1 at 64, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation of 42 and Agent 0's valuation of 0.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the most among the remaining options.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

With this distribution, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation.
