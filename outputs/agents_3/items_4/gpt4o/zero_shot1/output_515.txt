Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  94  52  51
1  96  38  81  24
2  15  14  22  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the total valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, while maximizing the overall value.

Let's look at the valuations again:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (35), Item 1 (94), Item 2 (52), Item 3 (51)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (96), Item 1 (38), Item 2 (81), Item 3 (24)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (15), Item 1 (14), Item 2 (22), Item 3 (62)

One strategy is to allocate items based on who values them the most. Let's assign each item to the agent that values it highest:

- Item 0: Highest value is from Agent 1 (96)
- Item 1: Highest value is from Agent 0 (94)
- Item 2: Highest value is from Agent 1 (81)
- Item 3: Highest value is from Agent 2 (62)

Based on these valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation maximizes the total value for each item. Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
