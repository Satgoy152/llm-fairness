Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  93  20  42
1  23  77  18  45
2  19  64  53  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the total value while ensuring fairness in terms of each agent receiving an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 1 has the highest value (93) for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 has a decent value (23) for Agent 1, but Agent 0 values it higher.
   - Item 3 has a value (45) for Agent 1, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value (53) for Agent 2.
   - Item 0 can be allocated to Agent 2 as Agent 1 and Agent 0 have already received higher valued items.

Based on the above reasoning, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
