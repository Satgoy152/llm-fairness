Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  43  69  18
1  83  79  10  27
2  34  55  95  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the agents' valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [87, 43, 69, 18]
   - Agent 1: [83, 79, 10, 27]
   - Agent 2: [34, 55, 95, 10]

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Value:**

   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Assign Items:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 87.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
   - Item 3: The highest remaining unassigned valuation is Agent 1 with a value of 27.

4. **Finalize Allocations:**

   - Agent 0 gets Item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 2 gets Item 2.

Based on these considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
