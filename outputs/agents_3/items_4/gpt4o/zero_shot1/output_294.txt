Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  93  45  86
1  32  95  23  45
2  55  59  80  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that no agent feels significantly undervalued compared to others. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [97, 93, 45, 86]
   - Agent 1: [32, 95, 23, 45]
   - Agent 2: [55, 59, 80, 72]

2. **Consider the Highest Valuations:**

   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (95).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (80).

3. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations:**

   - Give item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

   - Item 3 is left. Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 3 (86), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Final Allocation:**

Agent 0: Items 0 and 3  
Agent 1: Item 1  
Agent 2: Item 2  

This distribution ensures that each agent gets an item, and it maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
