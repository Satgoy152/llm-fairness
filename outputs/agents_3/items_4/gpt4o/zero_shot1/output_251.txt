Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  13  75  79
1  88  74  19  49
2  88   8  82  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This is a simple form of the assignment problem, which can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm or through intuitive reasoning.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  75  13  75  79
1  88  74  19  49
2  88   8  82  69
```

One possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, we must ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, given the constraints.

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 1 and agent 2 (88). We can assign it to agent 1.
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 1 (74). Since agent 1 already has item 0, we should consider assigning it to another agent. Agent 0 values it the second highest (13).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (75).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 0 (79).

Let's assign:
- Item 0 to agent 1.
- Item 1 to agent 0 (since agent 1 has item 0).
- Item 2 to agent 2.
- Item 3 to agent 0.

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the assignment is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is designed to maximize the respective agent's valuations based on the given preferences.
