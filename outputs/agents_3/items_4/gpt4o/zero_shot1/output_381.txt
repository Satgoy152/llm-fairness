Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  65  21  91  19
1  83  12  22   3
2  19  25  82  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 but not as high as Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 3.

Given these observations, we can aim for the following allocation strategy to maximize the total happiness:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a high valuation for it and Agent 0 can be compensated with item 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 has the highest valuation for it).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 has a higher overall valuation than the other agents for this item).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and respects the fairness principle based on the given valuations.
