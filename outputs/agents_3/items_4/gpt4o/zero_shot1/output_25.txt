Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  56  65  94
1  40  94  31  25
2  95  18  14  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Review the valuation table to understand each agent's preferences:

   ```
   Agent 0: Item 0 - 4,  Item 1 - 56, Item 2 - 65, Item 3 - 94
   Agent 1: Item 0 - 40, Item 1 - 94, Item 2 - 31, Item 3 - 25
   Agent 2: Item 0 - 95, Item 1 - 18, Item 2 - 14, Item 3 - 30
   ```

2. Identify the highest valued items for each agent:

   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (94).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (94).
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest (95).

3. Allocate each of these items to the respective agent:

   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2

4. Allocate the remaining item (Item 2) to the agent who values it the most among those who haven't received their highest valued item:

   - Agent 0 values Item 2 as 65.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 as 31.
   - Agent 2 values Item 2 as 14.

   The highest valuation for Item 2 is by Agent 0, who receives it.

5. The final allocation is:

   - Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives Item 0.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is based on maximizing their respective valuations.
