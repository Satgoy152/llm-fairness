Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  48  93  90
1  47  79  56  39
2  20  40   4  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are only 4 items and 3 agents, at least one agent will end up with only one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 (93) and item 3 (90) highly. To maximize total satisfaction, let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 (79) most highly. We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has lower valuations overall, but their highest is item 3 (43). We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Since we have already allocated 3 items, we need to allocate the remaining item, which is item 0.

4. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 (47) more than Agent 0 does (11) and more than Agent 2 does (20), so we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
