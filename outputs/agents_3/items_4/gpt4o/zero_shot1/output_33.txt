Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  29  17  48
1  14  58  51  51
2  87  81  57  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. We aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (valuation) is maximized while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [39, 29, 17, 48]
- Agent 1: [14, 58, 51, 51]
- Agent 2: [87, 81, 57, 14]

A fair approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. We can assign items as follows:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (87).
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (58).
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (51).
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (48).

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
