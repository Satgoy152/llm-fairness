Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  52  47  23
1  54  59  60  21
2   8  85  17  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 (87), which is the highest individual valuation across all agents.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 (60), which is the highest among the remaining items.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 (85), which is the highest among the remaining items.

For the last item:
4. Agent 2 also has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (71), which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item.

Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all items fairly.
