Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  91  50  37
1  68  35  23  71
2  87  62  32  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the satisfaction or total valuation of the allocated items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no item is allocated more than once. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Balance the allocation so that the total valuation is as fair as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- For Agent 0, the highest value is for item 1 (91).
- For Agent 1, the highest value is for item 3 (71).
- For Agent 2, the highest value is for item 0 (87).

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, and 3. We need to allocate the remaining item 2.

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 50.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 23.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 32.

Item 2 should go to the agent with the highest remaining valuation, which is Agent 0 (50).

So, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
