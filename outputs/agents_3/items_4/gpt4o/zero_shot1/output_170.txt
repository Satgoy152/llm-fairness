Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  32  33  39
1  94   3  95  94
2  49  66  68  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction. We'll try to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value more, while considering the overall distribution of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [39, 32, 33, 39]
- Agent 1 values: [94, 3, 95, 94]
- Agent 2 values: [49, 66, 68, 56]

We will aim to allocate items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied with the items they receive.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value of 95), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 1 (value of 66), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 and item 3 equally (both values of 39). Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
4. Agent 1 also has a high value for item 3 (value of 94) compared to the other agents, so allocate item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation distributes the items considering each agent's preferences while ensuring no agent is left without an item.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
