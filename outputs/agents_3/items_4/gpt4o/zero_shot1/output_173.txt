Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  89   0  31
1   6  93   7  87
2  84  38  41  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 39 (Item 0), 89 (Item 1), 0 (Item 2), 31 (Item 3)
   - Highest value is for Item 1.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 6 (Item 0), 93 (Item 1), 7 (Item 2), 87 (Item 3)
   - Highest value is for Item 1, but since Agent 0 receives Item 1, we consider the next highest, which is Item 3.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 84 (Item 0), 38 (Item 1), 41 (Item 2), 26 (Item 3)
   - Highest value is for Item 0.

Now, we have:
- Item 1 allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 3 allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 0 allocated to Agent 2.

Agent 2 also values Item 2 the most after Item 0, so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocation is:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
