Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  20  19  63
1  65  63  73  52
2  33  95   3  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is one approach to achieve this:

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 63

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 52

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 70

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued items first:
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest at 95, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest at 73, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest at 71, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. There is only one item left (Item 3). Allocate it to the agent who values it highest among the remaining options:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 63.
   - Agent 2 values Item 3 at 70.
   - Agent 2 values Item 3 the highest, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated all four items fairly considering each agent's valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
