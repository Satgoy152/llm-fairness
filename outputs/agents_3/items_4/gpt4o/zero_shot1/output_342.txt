Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  23  23  23
1  13  32  71  73
2  34   0   6  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's go through the valuation table and allocate the items based on the highest value an agent has for an item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Find the highest value for each item and allocate:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 13, Agent 2 at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 32, Agent 2 at 0. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 71, Agent 2 at 6. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 73, Agent 2 at 49. Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Ensure fair distribution:**
   - Currently, Agent 0 has [0], Agent 1 has [1, 2, 3], and Agent 2 has [].
   - To make the allocation fairer, we can re-evaluate the distribution to ensure more balanced allocations. One approach could be:
     - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 instead, as Agent 1 values it the most, but Agent 2 has no items, and Agent 0 has fewer items as well.

3. **Revised allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [1, 2]
   - Agent 2: [3]

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the distribution is balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
