Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  69   8  36  86
1  53  17  35  16
2  14  37  43  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item. We will look for a feasible allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  69   8  36  86
1  53  17  35  16
2  14  37  43  18
```

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent. This might not be optimal for all agents, but it provides a straightforward allocation with integer distributions.

Let's calculate a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 3 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 0 (53).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 2 (43).

Now, let's check if each agent can get their highest valued item without conflicts:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This leaves item 1 unallocated. To ensure all items are allocated, we could give item 1 to the agent with the next highest unallocated value:

- Agent 2 values item 1 at 37, which is higher than their other options.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2.

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
