Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  57   4  19
1  60  37   3  56
2  89  19  77  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 0: 1
   - Item 1: 57
   - Item 2: 4
   - Item 3: 19
   
2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 0: 60
   - Item 1: 37
   - Item 2: 3
   - Item 3: 56

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Item 0: 89
   - Item 1: 19
   - Item 2: 77
   - Item 3: 63

To maximize the total value each agent receives, we can prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 57)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 60)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 3 (values 77 and 63, respectively)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their highest valuations.
