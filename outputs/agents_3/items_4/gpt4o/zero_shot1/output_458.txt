Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  49  58  24
1  19  89  90  42
2  85  50  97  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0: [36, 49, 58, 24]
- Agent 1: [19, 89, 90, 42]
- Agent 2: [85, 50, 97, 95]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

1. Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 2 (85).
2. Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 1 (89).
3. Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 2 (97), but since Agent 2 already has item 0, we consider the next highest value, which is by Agent 1 (90).
4. Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 2 (95), but since Agent 2 already has item 0, we consider the next highest value, which is by Agent 1 (42), but Agent 1 already has item 1 and item 2, so we allocate it to Agent 0 (24).

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1, Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now, the JSON representation of the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with all items allocated.
