Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  72  90  88
1  68  86  15   8
2  87  68  45  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can utilize a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are only four items and three agents, one agent will receive two items. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 2 (90), followed by item 3 (88).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (86).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 0 (87).

Given these valuations, a possible fair allocation can be made by assigning each agent their highest valued item and then ensuring the remaining item is allocated to an agent who values it highly while maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's allocate:
- Agent 0: Item 2 (90), Item 3 (88)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (86)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (87)

This allocation aims to maximize total value and ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Now, presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
