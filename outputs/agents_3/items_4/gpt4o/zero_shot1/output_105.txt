Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  71  88  42
1  94  98  20  37
2  13  60  97  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 98 20 37]
 [13 60 97 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation. One possible approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment, aiming to maximize the total value of the allocations.

First, let's summarize the given valuations:
- Agent 0 values: Item 0 - 83, Item 1 - 71, Item 2 - 88, Item 3 - 42
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 - 94, Item 1 - 98, Item 2 - 20, Item 3 - 37
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 - 13, Item 1 - 60, Item 2 - 97, Item 3 - 28

Now, let's allocate the items optimally:

1. **Item 2** has the highest value of 97 for Agent 2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1** has the highest value of 98 for Agent 1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0** has the highest value of 94 for Agent 1, but since Agent 1 already has an item, the next highest value is 83 for Agent 0. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3** has the highest value of 42 for Agent 0. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 3
- Agent 1 gets Item 1
- Agent 2 gets Item 2

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
