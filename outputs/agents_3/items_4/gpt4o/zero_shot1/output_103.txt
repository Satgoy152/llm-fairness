Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  75  91  63
1  82  87  88  30
2   0   6  43  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 4 + 75 + 91 + 63 = 233
   - Agent 1: 82 + 87 + 88 + 30 = 287
   - Agent 2: 0 + 6 + 43 + 65 = 114

2. Determine the items each agent values the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (87), followed closely by item 2 (88), so we'll consider item 2 first.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (65).

3. Allocate items:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for agent 0).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation, after item 2 which is already taken).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for agent 2).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (remaining unallocated item with a relatively higher valuation for Agent 1).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while all items are distributed.
