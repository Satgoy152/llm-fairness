Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  88   9  78  36
1  85  80  92  65
2  22  22  97  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We can use a method similar to the "Hungarian algorithm" for this purpose, which is often used for optimal assignment problems.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [88, 9, 78, 36]
- Agent 1: [85, 80, 92, 65]
- Agent 2: [22, 22, 97, 41]

By examining the highest valuations for each item:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (88).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 (80).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 (97).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (65).

An allocation that respects these high valuations and fairly distributes the items might look like this:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets Item 2.

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
