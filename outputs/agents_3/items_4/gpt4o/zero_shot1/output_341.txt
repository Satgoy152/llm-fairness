Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  58  56  85
1  35  17  23   6
2  23  92  52  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation across all agents. This is a basic example of the Assignment Problem, which can be solved using various methods, one of which is the Hungarian algorithm. However, here I'll manually find a feasible solution that distributes the items fairly.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [0, 58, 56, 85]
- Agent 1 values: [35, 17, 23, 6]
- Agent 2 values: [23, 92, 52, 28]

To fairly allocate the items, we need to make sure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences without leaving any items unallocated.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (85), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (92), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. Agent 1 values item 0 (35) the most, so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
4. The remaining item 2 is valued adequately by agent 0 (56) and agent 2 (52), but to balance the allocation, we give item 2 to agent 2, who has room for another item after getting item 1.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
