Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  67  67  90
1  33  25  85  76
2  10  80  93  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 25 85 76]
 [10 80 93 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to find an allocation where each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while maximizing the overall value.

Let's look at the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 12, 67, 67, 90
- Agent 1 values: 33, 25, 85, 76
- Agent 2 values: 10, 80, 93, 68

A straightforward approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 33, which is the highest among the agents.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 80, which is the highest among the agents.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 93, which is the highest among the agents.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 90, which is the highest among the agents.

Now let's verify fairness and the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2

This allocation maximizes the total value for each item and ensures each agent gets at least one item. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
