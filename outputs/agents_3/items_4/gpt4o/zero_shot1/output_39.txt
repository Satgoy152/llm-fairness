Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  99  58  79
1  16  83  19  19
2  90   9  28  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 90

   Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, so item 0 is allocated to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 9

   Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, so item 1 is allocated to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 28

   Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, so item 2 is allocated to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 24

   Agent 0 values item 3 the highest, so item 3 is allocated to Agent 0.

Now, let's compile the allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
