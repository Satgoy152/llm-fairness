Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  74  25  73
1  81  90  11  68
2  15  74  89  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and only 4 items are allocated in total.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [97, 74, 25, 73]
- Agent 1: [81, 90, 11, 68]
- Agent 2: [15, 74, 89, 27]

We will look for an allocation where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most:

1. Item 0: Max value is 97 by Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Max value is 90 by Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Max value is 89 by Agent 2.
4. Item 3: Max value is 73 by Agent 0.

Assign the items based on these values:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
