Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  18   1  66  28
1  12  74  53  41
2  65  97  58  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [65 97 58 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent. Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate the items:

Valuation table:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  18   1  66  28
1  12  74  53  41
2  65  97  58  64
```

Let's consider each item:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 18
  - Agent 1 values it at 12
  - Agent 2 values it at 65 (highest)

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 1
  - Agent 1 values it at 74 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 97

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 66 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values it at 53
  - Agent 2 values it at 58

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 28
  - Agent 1 values it at 41 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 64

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value)
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value)
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value)
4. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value, but Agent 1 should get at least one item)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
