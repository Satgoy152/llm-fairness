Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  95  94  46
1  48  14  92   5
2  32  33   6   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. One common approach for such a problem is the "Hungarian algorithm," which seeks to optimize the assignment to maximize the total valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding a fair allocation:

1. **List the valuations for each agent across all items:**

    - Agent 0: [51, 95, 94, 46]
    - Agent 1: [48, 14, 92, 5]
    - Agent 2: [32, 33, 6, 6]

2. **Assign items based on highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:**

   - Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent:
     - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95).
     - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (92).
     - Agent 2 values item 1 the second most (33), but agent 0 already has item 1, so they get item 0 (32) instead.

3. **Assign remaining items to maximize fairness:**

   - Agent 0 has item 1.
   - Agent 1 has item 2.
   - Agent 2 has item 0.
   - The remaining item is 3, which Agent 0 values the most after item 1.

4. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1: Item 2.
   - Agent 2: Item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are assigned.

The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
