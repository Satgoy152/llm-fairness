Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  89  65  16
1  81  64  84  82
2  22  44  71  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider an approach where each agent receives items based on maximizing their individual valuations. Since there are three agents and four items, one agent will receive two items and the others one each, or we can distribute four items evenly among the agents if possible. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Determine the highest valuation for each item:**
    - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 81.
    - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 89.
    - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 84.
    - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 77.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
    - Agent 0: Item 1
    - Agent 1: Item 0 and Item 2
    - Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
