Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  16   2   7  85
1   7  69  75  45
2  34  40  14   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents according to their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while distributing the items evenly. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: 
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (34).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (69).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (75).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (85).

2. **Allocate based on highest valuations**:
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Check allocations**: Each agent should get at least one item, and all items should be allocated. Currently:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 2 gets Item 0.

This allocation respects each agent's highest preference for a corresponding item and ensures all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
