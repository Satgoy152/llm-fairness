Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  16  19   0
1  84  26  48  15
2  84  52  54  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Let's analyze the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0 at 77
   - Item 1 at 16
   - Item 2 at 19
   - Item 3 at 0

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0 at 84
   - Item 1 at 26
   - Item 2 at 48
   - Item 3 at 15

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0 at 84
   - Item 1 at 52
   - Item 2 at 54
   - Item 3 at 46

To fairly allocate items, we'll aim to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value: 84)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value: 52)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 54)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value: 0)

This allocation considers that:
- Agent 1 gets the most valuable item for them, Item 0.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 2, which are the most valuable remaining items for them.
- Agent 0 gets Item 3, which has no value to them but allows the other agents to maximize their gains.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent is included in the output.
