Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  48  88  91
1  35  89  37  46
2  84  55  47  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents considering their valuations, we can use a method to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: [6, 48, 88, 91]
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: [35, 89, 37, 46]
3. **Agent 2's valuations**: [84, 55, 47, 19]

We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (84).
  - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

- **Item 1**:
  - Highest valuation is from Agent 1 (89).
  - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Item 2**:
  - Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (88).
  - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

- **Item 3**:
  - Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (91).
  - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

With these allocations, every item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair distribution based on given valuations.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
