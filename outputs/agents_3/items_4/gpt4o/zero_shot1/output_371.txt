Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  22  25  94
1  90  45  39  94
2  99  52  66  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider the preferences of each agent based on their valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item while all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (94).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (99).

2. **Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring fairness:**
   - Agent 2 strongly values item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
   - Agent 1 can receive item 3, which is equally highly valued by agent 0, but since agent 2 already received their highest value, we give the next highest valued item (item 3) to agent 1.
   - Agent 0 can receive one of the remaining items (item 2 or item 1).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0 since it is more valuable to them than item 1.

3. **Distribute the remaining items:**
   - The remaining item, item 1, can be allocated to agent 1 to balance the number of items each agent receives.
  
This allocation process respects the individual preferences and ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 0. 

This ensures a fair and efficient distribution of items among the agents.
