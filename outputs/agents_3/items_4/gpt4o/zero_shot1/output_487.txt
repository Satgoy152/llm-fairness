Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0   7  43  51  29
1   0  11  85  47
2  88  76   4  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for the agents. We will try to assign items by considering the highest valuations for each agent and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 43
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 29

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 47

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 43

Let's attempt to allocate items to maximize the total satisfaction:

1. Agent 2 highly values Item 0 (88) and Item 1 (76). Assign Items 0 and 1 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 highly values Item 2 (85). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (29). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and it maximizes the total value based on the given valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
