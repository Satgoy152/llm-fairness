Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  40  77  13
1  10  13  49   6
2  49  96  63   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the value each agent gets from their assigned items. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the total value across all agents is maximized. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high value for item 0 (74) and item 2 (77).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2 (49) but lower than Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (96).

Given this, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1: Item 3.
- Agent 2: Item 1.

Now, in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
