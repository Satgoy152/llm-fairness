Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  84  50  79
1  23  82  33  82
2  70  98  53  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We have three agents (0, 1, and 2) and four items (0, 1, 2, and 3) to allocate.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [77, 84, 50, 79]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [23, 82, 33, 82]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [70, 98, 53, 62]

A reasonable approach is to try to allocate items to agents who value them the most. Here's one way to do it:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 77.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 50.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is fairly balanced, given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
