Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  28  55  89
1  18  48  86  68
2  51  84  11  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize overall value while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Let's examine the given valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  55  28  55  89
1  18  48  86  68
2  51  84  11  12
```

To maximize fairness and value, we can use the following approach:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they value it the most (89).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the most (86).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they value it the most (84).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they have the next highest value for this item (55).

This distribution maximizes each agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
