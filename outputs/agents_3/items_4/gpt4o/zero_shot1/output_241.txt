Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  94   8   0
1  53  64  13  61
2  61  69  16  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 64 13 61]
 [61 69 16 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. One method to achieve fairness is to try to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values for items are [4, 94, 8, 0]
- Agent 1: Values for items are [53, 64, 13, 61]
- Agent 2: Values for items are [61, 69, 16, 78]

We aim to allocate all four items to the agents in such a way that the total value is maximized.

1. Start with the highest valuation:
   - Item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (94) and is also highly valued by Agents 1 and 2. However, Agent 0 values it significantly more than the others.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. Next, consider the remaining items and their highest valuations:
   - Item 3 has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (78).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

3. Consider the next highest valuations for the remaining items:
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2 (61).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. Finally, for Item 2:
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since it is not yet assigned and Agent 1 has a decent valuation (13) for it compared to others.

Now, let's consolidate the allocations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
