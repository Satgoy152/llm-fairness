Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3
0  13   6  64  14
1  35  67  69  70
2  12  69  23  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13  6 64 14]
 [35 67 69 70]
 [12 69 23 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation of the items each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
       0   1   2   3
Agent 0: 13   6  64  14
Agent 1: 35  67  69  70
Agent 2: 12  69  23  84
```

The goal is to allocate these items such that the agents' valuations are considered, ideally maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items.

One possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3, but Agent 1 has a higher valuation for it.

Considering this, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valuation 64).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valuation 67).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (valuation 84).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valuation 35), as Agent 1 still has the highest overall valuation for their assigned items.

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on the highest possible valuations they can achieve with one item each and utilizes all 4 items.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a set of items with the highest possible valuation given the constraints.
