Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  45  29  44
1  87  96  62  45
2  10  17  14   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [48, 45, 29, 44]
- Agent 1 values: [87, 96, 62, 45]
- Agent 2 values: [10, 17, 14, 2]

A good strategy is to allocate the items in such a way that agents receive the items they value the most, if possible. Let's consider the highest values for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest valuation is 48 for item 0.
- Agent 1's highest valuation is 96 for item 1.
- Agent 2's highest valuation is 17 for item 1, but since item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1, we look at the next highest, which is 14 for item 2.

By analyzing the valuations, we can propose the following allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a higher valuation than Agent 2 for item 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the overall value extracted from the items based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
This allocation assigns two items to Agent 0, two items to Agent 1, and no items to Agent 2, ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
