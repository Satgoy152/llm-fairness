Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  11  61  37
1  23   0  36  69
2  25  99  30  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the valuations given in the table. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their perceived value while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (90), Item 1 (11), Item 2 (61), Item 3 (37)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (23), Item 1 (0), Item 2 (36), Item 3 (69)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (25), Item 1 (99), Item 2 (30), Item 3 (55)

A possible fair allocation could be to assign items based on maximizing the overall satisfaction (or total value) for each agent:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the most (99).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it the most (90).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (69).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued item available (61).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share given the constraints:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 3.
- Agent 2 receives Item 1.

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
