Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  34  15  16
1  67  53  38  88
2  11  73  88  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by observing the highest valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (64).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (88).

2. Assign these highest-valued items to each respective agent:
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2.

3. One item is left unassigned. Let's consider item 1 and determine which agent values it the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 34.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 53.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 73.

4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 since agent 2 values it the highest.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and their individual valuations are maximized given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
