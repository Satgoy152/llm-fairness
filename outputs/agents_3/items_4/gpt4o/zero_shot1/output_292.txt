Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  87  39   5
1  52  44  45  64
2  52  90  55  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that exactly four items are allocated in total. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 87.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 64.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 90.

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to the respective agents**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 because it holds the highest value among all agents for item 1.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.

3. **Allocate the remaining items**:
   - Item 0 has high value for Agent 0 (58), and there is no conflict with other agents valuing it higher.
   - Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 1 (45), as it is their next highest value and Agent 2 is already satisfied with item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is maximized. The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

Agent 0 receives item 0, Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, and Agent 2 receives item 1. This allocation uses all 4 items and each agent receives at least one item.
