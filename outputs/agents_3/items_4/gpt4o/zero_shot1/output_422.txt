Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  15   6   1  25
1  31   8  61  39
2  12  71  52  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. With the given valuations, a potential fair allocation can be determined by examining which agent values each item the most.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 15
  - Agent 1 values it at 31
  - Agent 2 values it at 12
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 6
  - Agent 1 values it at 8
  - Agent 2 values it at 71
  - Highest value: Agent 2

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 1
  - Agent 1 values it at 61
  - Agent 2 values it at 52
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 25
  - Agent 1 values it at 39
  - Agent 2 values it at 96
  - Highest value: Agent 2

Based on maximizing the value for each agent, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives no items, as they do not have the highest valuation for any item.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, as they have the highest valuations for these items.

Here is the fair allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
