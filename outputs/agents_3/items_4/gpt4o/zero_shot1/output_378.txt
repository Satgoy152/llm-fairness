Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  84  36  36
1  61  85  25  86
2  59  91  66  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item initially if possible. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning items based on the highest value for each item, ensuring no more than 4 items are allocated overall.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 61.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 91.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 66.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 86.

Let's summarize this allocation:

- Agent 0: No items have their highest valuation.
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2.

Finally, according to the specified JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
