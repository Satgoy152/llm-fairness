Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  69  56  15  48
1  38  66  29  16
2  50   1  73   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations, we can try to distribute the items in a way that gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  69  56  15  48
1  38  66  29  16
2  50   1  73   4
```

We want to allocate 4 items in total. One method to achieve a fair allocation is to assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (69).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (66).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (73).

Now, all agents have one item each. We still have item 3 to allocate. Should we consider which agent values it the most, or should we try to balance the total value each agent receives? Let's check who values item 3 the most:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 48.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 16.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 4.

Agent 0 values item 3 the most, so we can allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1: Item 1.
- Agent 2: Item 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
