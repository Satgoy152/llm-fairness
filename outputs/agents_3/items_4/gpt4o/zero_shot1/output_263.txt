Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  60  65   0
1  46  20   5  90
2  19  98  76  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Let's examine the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 65
  - Item 3: 0

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 5
  - Item 3: 90

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 76

A potential approach to fairly allocate the items is to assign each item to the agent who values it most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. Item 0:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (90)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (98)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (76)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (90)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

After the allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 2.

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
