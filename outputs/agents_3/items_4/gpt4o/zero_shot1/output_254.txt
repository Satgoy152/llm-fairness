Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  54  30  47
1  74  72  71  82
2  27  71   8  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 72 71 82]
 [27 71  8 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can try to assign items by focusing on the highest valuations for each agent.

The valuation matrix is:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  73  54  30  47
1  74  72  71  82
2  27  71   8  12
```

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (82). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (73). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (72). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** has a higher valuation for item 2 (30) than Agent 2 (8) and Agent 1 (71 already has two items). Assign item 2 to Agent 2 to give Agent 2 at least one item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items based on their valuations.
