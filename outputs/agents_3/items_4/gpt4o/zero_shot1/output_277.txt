Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  67  70   3
1  31  26  16   9
2  16  97  21  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent should get the item with the highest value according to their valuation. Item 2 is valued at 70 by agent 0, which is the highest value for this agent. We allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the highest at 31. We allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the highest at 97. We allocate item 1 to agent 2.

Now one item, item 3, is left. We need to allocate it in a way that maintains the balance of the allocation:

- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 3 at 9 after their highest (item 0).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 at 26, which is higher than agent 1's valuation.

Thus, we allocate item 3 to agent 2 to maximize the overall fairness based on their preferences.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
