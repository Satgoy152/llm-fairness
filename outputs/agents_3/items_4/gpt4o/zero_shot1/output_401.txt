Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  89  53  42
1  53  52  45  65
2  65  26   0   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 52 45 65]
 [65 26  0  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a simple method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation, trying to balance fairness and efficiency.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0: [21, 89, 53, 42]
- Agent 1: [53, 52, 45, 65]
- Agent 2: [65, 26, 0, 2]

Let's consider allocating the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values item 0 the most (65).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values item 1 the most (89).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values item 2 the most (53).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values item 3 the most (65).

Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are allocated based on who values them the most. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
