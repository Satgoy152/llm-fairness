Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  35  74  77
1  40  97  82  83
2  34  31  90  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Prioritize High Valuation Matches:**
   - First, identify the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item to that agent if possible.

2. **Avoid Conflicts:**
   - If two agents have a high value for the same item, try to find an alternative allocation that minimizes the loss in total valuation.

3. **Maximize Total Valuation:**
   - The goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents, ensuring that each agent has a fair share based on their preferences.

Based on the given valuations, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (77) and item 2 (74).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (97) and item 3 (83).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (90) and item 3 (88).

Considering these points, an optimal allocation might be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the most at 97.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, since Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it highly, but Agent 2's remaining valuations for other items are lower in comparison.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it gives them a high value and allows Agent 2 to take item 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it the most among the remaining choices.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on maximizing their respective valuations.
