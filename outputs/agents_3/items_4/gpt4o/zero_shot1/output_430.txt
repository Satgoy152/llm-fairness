Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  37  14  77
1  94  91  59  50
2  54  18  42   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on the given valuations, we can use a simple greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the highest, thus optimizing the total satisfaction.

Here is the breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 30.
   - Agent 1 values it at 94.
   - Agent 2 values it at 54.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 37.
   - Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Agent 2 values it at 18.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 14.
   - Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - Agent 2 values it at 42.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 77.
   - Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Agent 2 values it at 4.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** because they value it the most.

Given this allocation, the final distribution of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and each agent's valuation is maximized for their assigned items.
