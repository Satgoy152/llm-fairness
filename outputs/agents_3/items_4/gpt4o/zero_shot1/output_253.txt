Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  28  79  31
1  59  10  31  30
2  12  25  60  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is such that the agents' valuations are considered. With only 4 items and 3 agents, one agent will necessarily receive more than one item.

We can consider the following approach:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 0. This item has the highest valuation by agent 0, which is 81.
2. Allocate item 2 to agent 2. This item has a relatively high value for agent 2, which is 60.
3. Allocate item 3 to agent 1. This item has a value of 30 for agent 1, which is higher than any other item value for agent 1.
4. Allocate item 1 to agent 0. This item has a valuation of 28 for agent 0, which is higher than the other agents' valuations for this item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation is fair based on their respective valuations.

The allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
