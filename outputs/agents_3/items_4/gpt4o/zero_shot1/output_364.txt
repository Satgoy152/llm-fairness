Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  79  29  79
1   2  95  62  66
2  68  47  86  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the value each agent gets from the items they are allocated, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 79

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 62
  - Item 3: 66

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 15

A possible fair allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable distribution:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 73, which is the highest among all agents.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 95, which is the highest among all agents.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 86, which is the highest among all agents.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 79 and 66 respectively. However, since Agent 0 already received item 0, giving this item to Agent 1 balances the allocation.

Based on this analysis, the allocations would be:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [2]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
