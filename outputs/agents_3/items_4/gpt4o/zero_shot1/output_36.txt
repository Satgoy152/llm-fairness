Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  78  11  52
1  11  78  84  78
2  92  62  86  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 47.
   - Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Agent 2 values it at 92 (highest valuation).

   Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78 (tie with Agent 0).
   - Agent 2 values it at 62.

   Given the tie between Agent 0 and Agent 1, and Agent 0 has a higher total valuation potential for the items, assign item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11.
   - Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest valuation).
   - Agent 2 values it at 86.

   Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78 (highest valuation).
   - Agent 2 values it at 64.

   Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

By this allocation, each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuation preferences:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
