Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  14  51  50
1   8  56  47   7
2  98  40   5   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 14 51 50]
 [ 8 56 47  7]
 [98 40  5  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

Given the valuation table:

```
     0   1   2   3
0  60  14  51  50
1   8  56  47   7
2  98  40   5   1
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 98. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 with a valuation of 56. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 51. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. For item 3, Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 50. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

The allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item with a high valuation for them.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
