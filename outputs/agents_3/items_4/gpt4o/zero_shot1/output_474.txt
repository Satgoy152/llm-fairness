Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0   4   0  92  51
1   0  73  49  53
2  10  50  83  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (92) and item 3 (51).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (73) and item 3 (53).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (83) and item 3 (72).

To maximize fairness and total valuation, we try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly. This may not always be perfect due to conflicting high valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since they value it the highest (92).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest (73).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since they have a high valuation (72) and Agent 0 already got item 2.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as their secondary choice (4), since Agent 1 and Agent 2 have low valuations for it.

Based on this strategy, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is 4.
