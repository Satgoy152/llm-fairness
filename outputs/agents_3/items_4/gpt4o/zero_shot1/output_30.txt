Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  43  23  54
1   5   9  34  65
2  90  44  64  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5  9 34 65]
 [90 44 64 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Let's analyze the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  98  43  23  54
1   5   9  34  65
2  90  44  64  36
```

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.

To start, we will allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (valuation 98).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (valuation 65).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (valuation 64).

Now, only item 1 remains unallocated:
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 43.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 9.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 44.

Allocate item 1 to agent 2, who values it the most (valuation 44).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
