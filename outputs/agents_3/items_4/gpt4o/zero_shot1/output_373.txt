Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  44  44  11
1  40  87  36  80
2  35  74  40  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the options:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Values: [53, 44, 44, 11]

- **Agent 1:**
  - Values: [40, 87, 36, 80]

- **Agent 2:**
  - Values: [35, 74, 40, 95]

We want to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of values of allocated items) is maximized while each agent gets an item if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (87) and item 3 (80). Assign these items to Agent 1 first as they provide significant value.
2. **Agent 0** values item 0 (53) highly. Assign this item to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (40) the highest among the remaining unallocated items, but it's still relatively low compared to others. Assign this item to Agent 2.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation across agents while distributing the items fairly.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
