Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  53  24  53
1  90  90  47  73
2  77  93  11  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item by the agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 90, Agent 2 at 77.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 90, Agent 2 at 93.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 47, Agent 2 at 11.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 73, Agent 2 at 84.

We will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring a fair distribution.

Based on the valuations, a possible fair allocation is:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 90)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation 93)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation 24, since it's the least valued item overall)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation 53)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
  "0": [2, 3],
  "1": [0],
  "2": [1]
}
```
