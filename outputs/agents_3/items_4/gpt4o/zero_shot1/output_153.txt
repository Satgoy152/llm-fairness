Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  16  13  13
1  40  69  69  97
2  16  18  53   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item and aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, 2, and 3 at 16, 16, 13, and 13 respectively.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 1, 2, and 3 at 40, 69, 69, and 97 respectively.
- Agent 2 values items 0, 1, 2, and 3 at 16, 18, 53, and 0 respectively.

A possible fair allocation strategy is to assign each agent at least one item they value highly, if possible.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 at 97.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 at 53.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0's valuations are relatively consistent, but since items 0 and 1 are not taken yet and valued equally, assign item 0 or 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1 is left. Among Agent 0 and Agent 2, Agent 1 values it the highest but already has an item. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it equally to item 0 and it's not assigned to any agent yet.

With this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
