Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  68   4  17  11
1  73  61  86  24
2  78  26   7  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a similar share of the total valuation. Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 68     | 4      | 17     | 11     |
| 1     | 73     | 61     | 86     | 24     |
| 2     | 78     | 26     | 7      | 23     |

To achieve a fair allocation:
1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (68), so let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (86), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but it's already taken, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2 (26).
4. The remaining item is item 3. Agent 1 values it more than agent 0, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.

Thus, the allocations are:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 1

The final JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
