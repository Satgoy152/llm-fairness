Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  60  25  97
1  52  43  45  43
2  18   7  71  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18  7 71 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. This is a type of optimization problem. Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [14, 60, 25, 97]
- Agent 1 values: [52, 43, 45, 43]
- Agent 2 values: [18, 7, 71, 96]

We will try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

1. **Assign Item 3**: Item 3 has the highest valuation for Agent 0, with a value of 97. Agent 2 also values Item 3 highly at 96, but since Agent 0's valuation is slightly higher, we will assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 2**: Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 2, with a value of 71. Agent 1 values it at 45 and Agent 0 at 25, but since Agent 2 values it highest, we assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Assign Item 0**: Item 0 has its highest valuation from Agent 1, valued at 52. Therefore, we assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Assign Item 1**: Item 1 has its highest valuation from Agent 0, valued at 60. Agent 1 values it at 43 and Agent 2 at 7. Since Agent 0 has a higher valuation, we assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

Each agent has received an integer number of items, and all items have been allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
