Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  45  13   8
1  41  57  30  91
2  41  73  38  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Let's assess the values each agent places on the items and determine a distribution.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 8

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 91

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 38
  - Item 3: 81

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 79. Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 73. Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 30, and Agent 2 values it at 38. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 91. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

These allocations aim to give each agent the item(s) they value most highly, ensuring a fair and satisfactory distribution based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items corresponding to their highest valuations from the given options.
