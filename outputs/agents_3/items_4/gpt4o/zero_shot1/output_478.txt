Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  84  11  98
1  58  44  99  50
2  58  56  34  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 44 99 50]
 [58 56 34 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items to the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  96  84  11  98
1  58  44  99  50
2  58  56  34  50
```

A reasonable approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (96).
- Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (84).
- Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (99).
- Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (98).

Distributing based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: No items

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned where it provides the maximum value. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": []
}
```
