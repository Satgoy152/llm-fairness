Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  95  67  88
1  86  25  70  12
2  85  33  86  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31 95 67 88]
 [86 25 70 12]
 [85 33 86 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A simple method for this is to use a greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

|     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 31 | 95 | 67 | 88 |
| 1 | 86 | 25 | 70 | 12 |
| 2 | 85 | 33 | 86 | 37 |

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (86).
  
- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95).

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (86).

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (88).

Now, let's assign items to agents:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

After these allocations, each agent receives the following items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
