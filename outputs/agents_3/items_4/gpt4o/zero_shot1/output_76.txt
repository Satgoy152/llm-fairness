Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  21   8  72  77
1  47  86  22  59
2  80  51  46  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll aim for a distribution where each agent receives a roughly equal share of their perceived value.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:
    - Highest value items: Item 3 (77), Item 2 (72), Item 0 (21), Item 1 (8).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
    - Highest value items: Item 1 (86), Item 0 (47), Item 3 (59), Item 2 (22).

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
    - Highest value items: Item 0 (80), Item 3 (64), Item 1 (51), Item 2 (46).

We'll assign the items according to who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item when possible.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item the highest (80).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest (86).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (72).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (77).

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on highest valuations, and each agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness by maximizing the value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
