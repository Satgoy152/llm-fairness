Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  63  65  14
1  77  95  54  73
2  95   8   9  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we can make allocations as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 2 (valuation = 65).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (valuation = 95).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (valuation = 95).

Now we have one item left to allocate (item 3). We need to assign it where it adds the most value or balances the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 14.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 73.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 73.

Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value item 3 equally at 73. To balance the allocation since each agent has already received their most valued item, we can give item 3 to Agent 1, who also has a high valuation for it.

Thus, the final allocations are:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [0]

The JSON representation of the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
