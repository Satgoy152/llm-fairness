Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  17  60  27
1  89  71  95  65
2  66  30  72  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation or ensuring that each agent gets an item they highly value. Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [36, 17, 60, 27]
- Agent 1: [89, 71, 95, 65]
- Agent 2: [66, 30, 72, 32]

A reasonable approach is to try to assign each agent the item they value most, if possible, while ensuring each item is allocated only once. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (value 60).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 even more (value 95), but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we look at the next highest value for Agent 1, which is item 0 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly as well (value 72), but it's taken, so we look at their next highest valued item, which is item 0 (value 66), but item 0 is taken by Agent 1. Thus, we allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 32).

However, we must ensure the allocations are fair and optimal. In our initial allocation, item 2 is highly contested, so let's revise:

1. Assign item 2 to **Agent 1** (value 95), as they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 0 to **Agent 1** (value 89), as it is their second highest value.
3. Assign item 3 to **Agent 2** (value 32), as it is the remaining option for them.
4. Assign item 1 to **Agent 0** (value 17) as they are left with the least valued item.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and each item is allocated only once.
