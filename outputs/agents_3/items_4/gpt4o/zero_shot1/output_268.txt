Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  74  26  51
1  63  26  78  51
2  70  42  29   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations for each item. A straightforward method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Agent 2 values it at 70.
   - The highest valuation is from Agent 2, so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 74.
   - Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Agent 2 values it at 42.
   - The highest valuation is from Agent 0, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 26.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78.
   - Agent 2 values it at 29.
   - The highest valuation is from Agent 1, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 51.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Agent 2 values it at 9.
   - Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 have the same highest valuation. In such cases, we can choose one agent arbitrarily or look for balance. Here, I will assign it to Agent 0 to ensure a fairly balanced allocation.

Now, compile these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is four.
