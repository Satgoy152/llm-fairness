Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  16  66  80
1  51  18  35  65
2  66   4  54  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent. One approach is to maximize the total value perceived by all agents, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [1, 16, 66, 80]
- Agent 1 values: [51, 18, 35, 65]
- Agent 2 values: [66, 4, 54, 36]

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 has the highest value (80) for item 3.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 2 has the highest value (66) for item 0.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has a relatively higher value (18) for item 1 compared to others.
4. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has the highest value (66) for item 2.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

This way, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation tries to respect the highest valuations where possible.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
