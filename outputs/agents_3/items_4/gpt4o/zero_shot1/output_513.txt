Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  66  21  53
1  32  96   4  98
2  11  35  30  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 53

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 98

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 43

Given these valuations, let's aim to allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 96.
2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 also values this item high at 98.
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a high valuation of 60 for this item.
4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2**: This allocation respects Agent 2's relatively higher valuation of 30 for this item compared to others.

With this allocation, each agent receives items according to their preferences, and all items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
