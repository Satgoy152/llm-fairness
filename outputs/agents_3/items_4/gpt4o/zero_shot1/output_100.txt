Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  28  92  28
1  76  42  10  83
2  77  14  43  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can look for a way to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (92), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (83), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (77), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. The remaining item is 1, which can be allocated to agent 1, as they have the second-highest valuation for this item (42), and it maximizes their total value.

This allocation ensures that each item is given once, and the total valuation is maximized under these constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
