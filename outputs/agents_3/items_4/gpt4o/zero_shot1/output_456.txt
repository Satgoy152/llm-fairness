Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0   2  35  46  27
1   8  62  44  42
2  35   6  42  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no more than four items in total are allocated. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [2, 35, 46, 27]
- Agent 1: [8, 62, 44, 42]
- Agent 2: [35, 6, 42, 89]

Let's allocate items by considering the highest valuations for each agent and ensuring each item is allocated only once.

1. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 89. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 62. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 46. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. The remaining item is item 0. The highest remaining valuation for item 0 is by Agent 2 at 35. However, since Agent 2 already received item 3, we allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation for remaining items, which is Agent 0 for item 0 with a valuation of 2.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
