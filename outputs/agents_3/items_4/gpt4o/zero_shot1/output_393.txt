Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  29  18  82  71
1  99  61  74  41
2  51  85  66  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 4 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

- **Agent 0** values:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 82
  - Item 3: 71

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 41

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 57

By looking at the highest values each agent has for items, we can try to allocate items in a way that maximizes total value:

1. **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 1 (value 99) - highest value for Item 0.
2. **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 2 (value 85) - highest value for Item 1.
3. **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 0 (value 82) - highest value for Item 2.
4. **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0 (value 71) - highest remaining value for Item 3.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
