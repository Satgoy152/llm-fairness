Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  41  78  55
1  79  94  62  18
2  25  34  96  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or the total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each item and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 94.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 96.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 55.

This ensures each item is given to the agent who values it most, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 2. 

This allocation respects the condition that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total value based on the given valuations.
