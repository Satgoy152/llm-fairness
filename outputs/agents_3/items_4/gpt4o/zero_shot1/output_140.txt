Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  41   5  59
1  73  76  50  69
2   8  54  71  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation given to all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's evaluate the best allocation of the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 73 (highest value for this item)
   - Agent 2 values it at 8

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41
   - Agent 1 values it at 76 (highest value for this item)
   - Agent 2 values it at 54

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 50
   - Agent 2 values it at 71 (highest value for this item)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59 (highest value for this item)
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Agent 2 values it at 44

Based on this analysis, the items should be allocated as follows to maximize the total valuations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
