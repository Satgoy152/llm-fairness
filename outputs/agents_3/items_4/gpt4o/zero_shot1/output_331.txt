Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  84  99  92  67
1   9  45  96  37
2  29   7  80  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and no agent gets more than the fair share of items (which, in this case, means no agent should get more than 2 items since there are 3 agents and 4 items).

Let's consider the valuations and find a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 67

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 37
  
- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 78

A fair allocation approach could be:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation to each agent if possible.
2. Adjust based on remaining items and values.

Let's assign:

1. Agent 0 gets Item 1 (value 99)
2. Agent 1 gets Item 2 (value 96)
3. Agent 2 gets Item 3 (value 78)

Now, Item 0 remains unallocated. We should allocate this to the agent who values it the most without disrupting the fairness:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 at 84
- Agent 1 values Item 0 at 9
- Agent 2 values Item 0 at 29

Therefore, assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it maximizes their total value while maintaining fairness.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
