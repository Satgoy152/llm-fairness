Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  45  36  59
1  35  67  43  86
2  17  80  88   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no item is allocated more than once.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** 
   - Item 0: 98
   - Item 1: 45
   - Item 2: 36
   - Item 3: 59

2. **Agent 1's valuations:** 
   - Item 0: 35
   - Item 1: 67
   - Item 2: 43
   - Item 3: 86

3. **Agent 2's valuations:** 
   - Item 0: 17
   - Item 1: 80
   - Item 2: 88
   - Item 3: 8

Now let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (98), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 3 (86), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (88), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
- For the remaining Item 1, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (80), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

Now each agent has at least one item:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
