Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  46  93  18
1  76  55  49  36
2  95  34  74  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 93, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 76, so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 95, but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, we'll allocate the next highest available item, item 2, to Agent 2. However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we allocate the next highest available item, which is item 1 with a valuation of 34.
4. The remaining item, item 3, can be allocated to Agent 1, who values it at 36, which is higher than the valuation by Agent 0 (18) and Agent 2 (23).

So, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item [2]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 3]
- Agent 2 gets item [1]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
