Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  83  44  72
1  78  85  47  49
2  91  21  52  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the overall happiness or total valuation based on the given table.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: 99, 83, 44, 72  
Agent 1's valuations: 78, 85, 47, 49  
Agent 2's valuations: 91, 21, 52, 89  

One way to allocate the items is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 78, and Agent 2 at 91. The highest value is 99 by Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 85, and Agent 2 at 21. The highest value is 85 by Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 at 47, and Agent 2 at 52. The highest value is 52 by Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 49, and Agent 2 at 89. The highest value is 89 by Agent 2.

Based on this analysis, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
