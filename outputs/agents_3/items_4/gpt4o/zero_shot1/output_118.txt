Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  47  94  35
1  26  44   9  26
2  39  85  71  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here's a reasonable way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [45, 47, 94, 35]
   - Highest value is for item 2.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [26, 44, 9, 26]
   - Highest value is for item 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [39, 85, 71, 39]
   - Highest value is for item 1, but since it's already allocated, next highest is item 2, also allocated. Next is item 0.

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's value:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it provides the highest value of 94.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it provides the highest value of 44.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it's the highest available value for them at 39.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the next highest value for them at 35.

Now, each agent has a fair allocation based on maximizing their satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
