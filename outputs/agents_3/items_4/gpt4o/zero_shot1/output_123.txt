Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  64  31  61
1  22  15  54  80
2  12  68  38  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and only four items are allocated in total.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 61
  
- Agent 1 values items:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 80

- Agent 2 values items:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 38
  - Item 3: 17

A possible fair allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - Assign to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 68
   - Assign to Agent 2

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 31
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 38
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 61
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - Assign to Agent 1

With this allocation, we ensure each agent receives items they value highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
