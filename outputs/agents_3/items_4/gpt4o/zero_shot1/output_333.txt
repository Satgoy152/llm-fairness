Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  47   3  86  46
1  64  18  64  12
2  30  93  73  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the four items such that the collective value is optimized and each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Let's evaluate the allocations step by step:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: [47, 3, 86, 46]
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: [64, 18, 64, 12]
3. **Agent 2's valuations**: [30, 93, 73, 46]

To determine the allocation, let's try to assign the items to maximize the total valuation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 64.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 46. We'll assign it to Agent 2 since Agent 0 already received an item.

Now, allocating based on highest valuations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.
