Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  75  13  89
1  92  28   9  91
2  42  38  19  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 89. Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 92. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest, but it's already allocated to agent 0. The next highest value for agent 2 is item 2 at 19. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 1 is the only unallocated item. Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most among the unallocated options.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 75. 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 28.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 38.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the distribution while considering each agent's preferences.
