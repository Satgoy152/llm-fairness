Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  69  56  41  50
1  52  50  55  41
2  65   4  87  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations. We'll aim for a balanced distribution of value across the agents.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 (69), Item 1 (56), Item 2 (41), Item 3 (50)
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 (52), Item 1 (50), Item 2 (55), Item 3 (41)
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 (65), Item 1 (4),  Item 2 (87), Item 3 (59)

One way to fairly allocate the items is to assign them such that each agent receives the highest value item available to them, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign Item 0 (value 69) - highest value for Agent 0
- Agent 1: Assign Item 2 (value 55) - highest value for Agent 1
- Agent 2: Assign Item 3 (value 59) - second-highest value for Agent 2
- Agent 0: Assign Item 1 (value 56) - second-highest value for Agent 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one high-value item according to their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
