Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  35  84  87
1  87  85  85  83
2  61  47  37  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 47 37 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. We need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that the total value is maximized for all agents combined, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [30, 35, 84, 87]
Agent 1: [87, 85, 85, 83]
Agent 2: [61, 47, 37, 61]
```

One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.

By following this allocation strategy, we ensure that items are assigned based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1].
- Agent 2 receives no items as there are no items that they value the most.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": []
}
```

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuations provided by each agent.
