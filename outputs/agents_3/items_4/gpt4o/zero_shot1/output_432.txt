Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  89   2   2  23
1  19  18  91  43
2  38  69  84  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value that each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We can use an algorithm to find an optimal allocation. In this case, we'll attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest-valued items.

Let's analyze the matrix:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 23

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 43

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 38
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 55

Based on these valuations, we should aim to allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent. Here is a possible optimal allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 89, highest for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 91, highest for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value = 69, highest for Agent 2).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 55, second highest for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are highly valued according to their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
