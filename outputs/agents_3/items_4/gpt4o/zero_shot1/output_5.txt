Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  93  32  59
1  98  37  68   7
2  59  37   0  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to solve such problems is to use the "maximum weight matching" algorithm from graph theory. However, since this is a small problem, we can attempt a heuristic approach to find a fair allocation manually.

Let's evaluate the valuation table:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 14 | 93 | 32 | 59 |
| 1          | 98 | 37 | 68 | 7  |
| 2          | 59 | 37 | 0  | 33 |

To maximize the total value assigned to the agents, we can use a greedy approach:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 with 98.
2. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 with 93.
3. Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 with 68.
4. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 3 with 59.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these selections:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0.
- Item 2 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 3 goes to Agent 0.

Agent 2 will not receive any items since Agent 0 and Agent 1 have higher valuations for the available items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
