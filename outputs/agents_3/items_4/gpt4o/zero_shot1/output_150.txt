Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  15   3  72
1  64  81  77  27
2  91  68  27  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation. We'll assign items to agents such that the total value is maximized while each agent gets an integer number of items, and each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (72), Item 0 (52)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 1 (81), Item 2 (77)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (68)

From the above, a fair allocation that maximizes total value could be:

- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 72)
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 81)
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 91)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 77)

This allocation maximizes the total valuation and ensures each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives Item 0.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
