Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  42  10   6
1  69  50  65  25
2  68  30  70  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 50 65 25]
 [68 30 70 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [76, 42, 10, 6]. The highest value is item 0 (76), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [69, 50, 65, 25]. The highest value is item 2 (65), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [68, 30, 70, 78]. The highest value is item 3 (78), so assign item 3 to agent 2.

Now we have assigned items 0, 2, and 3. We need to assign the remaining item 1:

- Item 1's valuations are 42 for agent 0, 50 for agent 1, and 30 for agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 to maximize overall satisfaction.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
