Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  55  14  57
1  63  31  24  13
2  44  49   2  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the overall value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (97), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (95), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
3. Agent 1 has relatively high values for items 1 and 2 compared to their other options, but item 1 is the highest (31), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
4. Finally, item 2 can be allocated to agent 0, as it balances the allocation while still providing some value to that agent (14).

This allocation ensures that each item is given to one agent and that the distribution maximizes the satisfaction based on individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
