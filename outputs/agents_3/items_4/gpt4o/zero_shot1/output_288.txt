Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  13  32   9
1   3  69  80   2
2  43   0  10  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value assigned to each agent. The Hungarian algorithm or similar optimization techniques are often used for such allocation problems, but since we are doing this manually, we'll aim for a reasonable distribution based on the highest valuations.

Here are the valuations for reference:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 9

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 2

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 74

To achieve a fair allocation, we will assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (80).
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (74).
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (66).
4. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (69) among the remaining items.

Therefore, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their individual valuations.
