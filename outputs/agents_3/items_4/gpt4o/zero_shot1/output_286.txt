Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  35  36  95
1  42  87   6  98
2  77  68  65  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 68 65 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We need to distribute the 4 items among the 3 agents.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
       0   1   2   3
Agent 0: 12  35  36  95
Agent 1: 42  87   6  98
Agent 2: 77  68  65  98
```

To ensure fairness, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives by allocating them the items they value the most. Let's approach this step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 3 (95), followed by item 2 (36).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 3 (98), followed by item 1 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 3 (98), followed by item 0 (77).

Since item 3 is valued highly by all agents, we need to decide who gets it. To distribute fairly, we will give item 3 to an agent who has other high-value options:

- Give item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 and Agent 2 have other high-value options).
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Give item 0 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).

Now we need to allocate one more item:

- Agent 0 still needs an item and values item 2 next highest (36).
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 65, which is higher than Agent 0's value of 36.

To allocate fairly:

- Give item 2 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1] 
- Agent 1 receives items: [3]
- Agent 2 receives items: [0, 2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
