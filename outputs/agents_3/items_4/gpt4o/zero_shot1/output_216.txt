Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  61   4  25
1  33  98   1  96
2  53  82  22  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all items allocated. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 25

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 96

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 78

A fair allocation strategy can involve trying to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Based on the valuations, one possible allocation could be:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation for it (98).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation for it (96).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 as they have the highest valuation for it (53).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 1 has already received two items, and Agent 0 values it more than Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is fair based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
