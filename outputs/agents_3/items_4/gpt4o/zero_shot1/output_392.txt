Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  78  90  49
1  58  28  37  34
2  46  60  95  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value = 90).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value = 58).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value = 95).

2. Allocate at least one item to each agent based on their highest valuation:
   - Give item 2 to Agent 2 (value = 95).
   - Give item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 58).
   - Give item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 78).

3. Allocate the remaining item (item 3) to the agent who values it the most among those not getting their top pick:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 49.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 34.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 36.

   The highest valuation for item 3 is from Agent 0 (value = 49).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: item 2

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
