Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  59  14  50
1  98  97  83  19
2  38  52  44  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 52
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 14
  - Item 3: 50

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 19

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 38
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 54

A possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's determine the agent with the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (98)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (97)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (83)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (54)

This initial assignment gives all items to Agent 1 and none to the others. To ensure fairness, we need to reallocate:

One possible fair allocation:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for this item after Agent 1).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for this item after Agent 1).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for this item after Agent 2).

This allocation balances the distribution while considering the valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

Now let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
