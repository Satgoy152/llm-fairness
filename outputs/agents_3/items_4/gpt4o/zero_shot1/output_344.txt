Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  16   8  84
1  99  44  29  61
2  99  72  44  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 84

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 61

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 90

To maximize satisfaction, we could aim to give each agent the item they value the most. However, we must ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item since there are three agents and four items.

Let's consider the highest-value items for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest value is for Item 3 (84).
- Agent 1's highest value is for Item 0 (99).
- Agent 2's highest value is for Item 3 (90), but since Agent 0 is already allocated Item 3, Agent 2's second highest is Item 1 (72).

Thus, we can allocate as follows:
- Agent 0 receives Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.
- Agent 2 receives Item 1.
- The remaining item, Item 2, can go to Agent 0, as they have the lowest alternative value for items already allocated.

Therefore, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and all items are distributed fairly based on the given valuations.
