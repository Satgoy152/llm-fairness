Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  60  60  60
1  67  11  94  79
2  58  59  60  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A possible way to achieve this is by looking for an allocation that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [88, 60, 60, 60]
- Agent 1 values items as: [67, 11, 94, 79]
- Agent 2 values items as: [58, 59, 60, 76]

Let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Assign highest valued items to agents:**
   - Agent 0 should get item 0 (value 88) since it's their highest value.
   - Agent 1 should get item 2 (value 94) since it's their highest value.
   - Agent 2 should get item 3 (value 76) since it's their highest value.

2. **Allocate remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is item 1.
   - The values for item 1 are: 
     - Agent 0: 60
     - Agent 1: 11
     - Agent 2: 59
   - The highest value for item 1 is from Agent 0 (value 60), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.

The allocation based on maximizing the individual valuations is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences and all items are fairly distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
