Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  26  71  29
1  61  60  38  93
2  45  55  61  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation using a simple optimization approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [51, 26, 71, 29]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 with value 71

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [61, 60, 38, 93]
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 with value 93

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [45, 55, 61, 69]
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 with value 69, but itâ€™s already taken, so we look at the next highest that is free.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2 (highest value for Agent 0 and not taken by others)
- Agent 1 gets Item 3 (highest value for Agent 1 and not taken by others)
- Agent 2 gets Item 1 (next best available item for Agent 2)

We have one item left to allocate, which is Item 0. We will assign it to Agent 1, as it gives the highest remaining value to any agent not already maximizing their allocation. This leaves Agent 0 and Agent 1 with two items each while Agent 2 gets one item, but we remain within the constraints of four total items allocated.

The allocations are as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
