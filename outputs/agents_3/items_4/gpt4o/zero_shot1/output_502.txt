Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  88  93  16
1  19  68  23  84
2  25  54  62  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents based on the given valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each one gets an integer number of items. One way to achieve this is by assigning items to the agents in a manner that balances their satisfaction.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [97, 88, 93, 16]
- Agent 1: [19, 68, 23, 84]
- Agent 2: [25, 54, 62, 91]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0** (97, 19, 25):
   - Agent 0 values this item the most at 97, so we assign it to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1** (88, 68, 54):
   - Agent 0 also values this item the most at 88. However, if Agent 0 gets it, we need to consider other agentsâ€™ total values. Agent 1 values it decently at 68, and Agent 2 values it at 54. Assigning it to Agent 0 might unbalance the allocation, so we consider options for other items as well.
   - Let's consider giving it to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2** (93, 23, 62):
   - Agent 0 values this item the most at 93, and Agent 2 values it at 62. Assigning it to Agent 0 gives them a significant advantage but balances their total allocation.

4. **Item 3** (16, 84, 91):
   - Agent 2 values this item the most at 91. Agent 1 values it at 84. Giving it to Agent 2 balances their allocation.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 gets item [1].
- Agent 2 gets item [3].

These allocations ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and maximize value distribution fairly.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
