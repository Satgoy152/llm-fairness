Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  98  46  34
1  72  84  70  58
2  47  20  17  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive by taking one item at a time.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total value each agent gets.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- Agent 0 values: [54, 98, 46, 34]
- Agent 1 values: [72, 84, 70, 58]
- Agent 2 values: [47, 20, 17, 73]

We'll start by assigning the highest value items to ensure the highest total satisfaction.

1. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (98), compared to Agents 1 and 2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 (72), compared to Agents 0 and 2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (73), compared to Agents 0 and 1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Now, for Item 2, Agent 1 has a higher value (70) than Agent 0 (46) and Agent 2 (17). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
