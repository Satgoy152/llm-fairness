Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  49  46  99
1  81  84  56  96
2   4  52  95  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to give each agent the item they value the most. Here's one way to do it:

1. We start by looking at the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate accordingly, keeping in mind that each item can only be allocated once.

2. We proceed to allocate items based on the highest valuation that has not yet been assigned, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's the detailed allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (value 99), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 84), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 95), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Now, item 0 is left. We look at the remaining items and allocate them to the agent who has the next highest valuation for the unallocated items.

- Item 0 has the highest remaining value for agent 0 (value 85), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
