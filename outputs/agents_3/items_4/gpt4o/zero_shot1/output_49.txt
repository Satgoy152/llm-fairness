Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  27  46  26
1  97   4  95  28
2  56  27  76  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing the total satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use a method like the maximum weight matching in bipartite graphs, but given the small size of the problem, a simple manual inspection can suffice.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [40, 27, 46, 26]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [97, 4, 95, 28]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [56, 27, 76, 48]

One possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 27, but Agent 2 also values it the same at 27. Since Agent 0 has other items they value more, we can assign this to Agent 2 to ensure each gets an item.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 95.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 48.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 4:

- Agent 0 can be assigned Item 0 (since Agent 1 is getting Item 2, which they value even higher).
- Agent 1 can be assigned Item 2.
- Agent 2 can be assigned Items 1 and 3.

This approach ensures maximum satisfaction based on the initial valuations while ensuring an even distribution of items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
