Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  50  96  97
1  36  92  78  29
2  45  88  47  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, let's analyze possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 has the highest value (97) for Agent 0.
   - Choosing item 3 for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1 has the highest value (92) for Agent 1.
   - Choosing item 1 for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value (47) for Agent 2, but Agent 1 values item 2 more. Let's check for the best remaining option.
   - Item 0 has a value of 45 for Agent 2, which is the best available option for Agent 2.
   - Choosing item 0 for Agent 2.

4. **Re-evaluate for the remaining item (item 2):**
   - Item 2 is valued at 78 by Agent 1 and 96 by Agent 0. 
   - However, since Agent 1 already has item 1 and Agent 0 has item 3, we will allocate item 2 to Agent 1, who values it the second highest and hasn't received a second item yet.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
