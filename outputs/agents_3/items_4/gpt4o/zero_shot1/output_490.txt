Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  48   8   1
1  58  74  23   5
2  74   0  96  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [55, 48, 8, 1]

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Values: [58, 74, 23, 5]

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Values: [74, 0, 96, 14]

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize the total value received by all agents:

- Item 2 has the highest value of 96 for Agent 2, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Item 1 has the highest value of 74 for Agent 1, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 0 has the highest value of 74 for Agent 2, but since Agent 2 already has an item, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it at 55 (the next highest valuation).
- For the last item, Item 3, Agent 2 values it at 14, which is higher than Agent 0's and Agent 1's valuations, but Agent 2 already has an item. Therefore, allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 who values it at 5.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [2]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
