Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  84  21  22
1  61  51  73  34
2  45  24  17  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 71
  - Agent 1: 61
  - Agent 2: 45
  
  Highest value: Agent 0

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 84
  - Agent 1: 51
  - Agent 2: 24
  
  Highest value: Agent 0

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 21
  - Agent 1: 73
  - Agent 2: 17
  
  Highest value: Agent 1

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 22
  - Agent 1: 34
  - Agent 2: 91
  
  Highest value: Agent 2

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are assigned to agents with the highest valuations for those items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
