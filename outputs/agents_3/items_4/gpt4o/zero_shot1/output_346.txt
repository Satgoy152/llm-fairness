Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  28   0  50
1  23  76  29  45
2   7  76   7  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total utility or valuation each agent receives. A common approach for such problems is to use a method like the Hungarian algorithm or to manually assign the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (63), 1 (28), 2 (0), 3 (50)
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (23), 1 (76), 2 (29), 3 (45)
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (7), 1 (76), 2 (7), 3 (46)

Looking at the valuations, it seems reasonable to allocate items in a way that each agent gets the highest-valued item that is not highly valued by others, or simply ensure each gets a significant share based on their top preferences.

Let's try an allocation:

1. Item 0: Best for Agent 0 (63)
2. Item 1: Best for Agent 1 (76), tied with Agent 2, but Agent 1 has more overall stakes.
3. Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 since Agent 0 and Agent 2 have zero and low values.
4. Item 3: Best for Agent 2 (46)

Following this allocation for fairness and balance:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
