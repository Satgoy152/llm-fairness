Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  95  63  39
1  50  74  79  81
2  94  30  46  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is done in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or value for the agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 10
- Item 1: 95
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 39

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 50
- Item 1: 74
- Item 2: 79
- Item 3: 81

Agent 2's valuations:
- Item 0: 94
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 46
- Item 3: 23

To maximize the total valuation, we can assign the items based on the highest individual valuations:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it the highest at 94.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it the highest at 95.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the highest at 81.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, thereby maximizing the total valuation.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
