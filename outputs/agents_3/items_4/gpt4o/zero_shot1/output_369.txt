Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  78  74  62  18
1  17  82  46  76
2  22  49  38  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 78
- Item 1: 74
- Item 2: 62
- Item 3: 18

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 82
- Item 2: 46
- Item 3: 76

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 22
- Item 1: 49
- Item 2: 38
- Item 3: 21

We can use a strategic allocation method like the following:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (78).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (82).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the second-highest valuation (46) and it helps balance their total value.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their only chance at receiving an item and they have a moderate value for it (21).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
