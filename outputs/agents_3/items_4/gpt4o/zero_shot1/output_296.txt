Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  32  40  78
1  31  36  27  47
2  91  36  56  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a potential allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [54, 32, 40, 78]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (78)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [31, 36, 27, 47]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (47), but item 3 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest item: Item 1 (36)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: [91, 36, 56, 73]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (91)

Now we have allocated items 0, 1, and 3. We need to allocate one more item to ensure all items are distributed. The remaining item is:

- Item 2 is left. Let's allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation for a remaining item.

4. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuation for Item 2: 40
   - Already has Item 3

5. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuation for Item 2: 27

6. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuation for Item 2: 56

Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, since they have the highest valuation among the remaining options.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
