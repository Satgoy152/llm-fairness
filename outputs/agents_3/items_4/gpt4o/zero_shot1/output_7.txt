Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  67  59  23
1   6  34  10  93
2  80  60  68  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values: 48, 67, 59, 23
   - Agent 1 values: 6, 34, 10, 93
   - Agent 2 values: 80, 60, 68, 69

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Let's allocate the items to the agent who values them the most in order to maximize total satisfaction.

   - **Item 0:**
     - Agent 0 values it at 48
     - Agent 1 values it at 6
     - Agent 2 values it at 80
     - **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2** because they value it the most.

   - **Item 1:**
     - Agent 0 values it at 67
     - Agent 1 values it at 34
     - Agent 2 values it at 60
     - **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0** because they value it the most.

   - **Item 2:**
     - Agent 0 values it at 59
     - Agent 1 values it at 10
     - Agent 2 values it at 68
     - **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2** because they value it the most.

   - **Item 3:**
     - Agent 0 values it at 23
     - Agent 1 values it at 93
     - Agent 2 values it at 69
     - **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1** because they value it the most.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Items 0 and 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
