Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  76  37  94
1  53  88  75  14
2  14  35   4  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. This involves assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 72     | 76     | 37     | 94     |
| 1     | 53     | 88     | 75     | 14     |
| 2     | 14     | 35     | 4      | 26     |

To ensure a fair allocation, let's follow the method of assigning the highest valued item to each agent in a round-robin manner, while trying to maximize the overall value:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is for Item 3 (94).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for Item 1 (88).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for Item 1 (35), but it's already taken, so next highest is Item 3 (26), which is also taken, next is Item 0 (14).
4. **Agent 0:** Next highest available is Item 1 (76), but it's taken. Next is Item 0 (72), which is available.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.
- Agent 0 gets Item 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are distributed.
