Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  41  98  32
1  85   3   7  64
2  30  36  92  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 41 98 32]
 [85  3  7 64]
 [30 36 92 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents based on their valuations. One common way to approach this is to use a greedy method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's evaluate the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  26  41  98  32
1  85   3   7  64
2  30  36  92  99
```

1. For item 0, the highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 85.
2. For item 1, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 41.
3. For item 2, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 98.
4. For item 3, the highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 99.

Based on the above evaluations, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0 to agent 1
- Item 1 to agent 0
- Item 2 to agent 0
- Item 3 to agent 2

This ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
