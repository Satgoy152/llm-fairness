Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  44  95  98
1  85   8  85  76
2  36  45  96  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent, then distribute them accordingly to balance the allocations.

Here are the valuations for each item by agent:
- Agent 0: [56, 44, 95, 98]
- Agent 1: [85, 8, 85, 76]
- Agent 2: [36, 45, 96, 35]

We can start by assigning the highest value items to each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (98), so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (85), so we assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (96), so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated three items, and only one item remains (item 1). Let's assign this item to the agent who values it the most among remaining options:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 44.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 8.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 45.

Agent 2 values item 1 the most, so we assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are:
- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: items 2 and 1

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
