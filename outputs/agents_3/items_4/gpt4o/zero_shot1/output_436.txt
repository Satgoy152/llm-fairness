Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  19  36  74
1  41  26  32  52
2   7   2   8  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 26 32 52]
 [ 7  2  8 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. We'll evaluate different combinations to find a reasonable allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [10, 19, 36, 74]
- Agent 1 values: [41, 26, 32, 52]
- Agent 2 values: [7, 2, 8, 49]

We need to consider each agent's highest preferences while balancing fairness:

1. Agent 2 appears to value item 3 most highly with a valuation of 49. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

2. Agent 1 values item 0 highest with 41. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 0 has a high preference for item 3 but it's already allocated. Their next highest is item 2 with a value of 36. However, Agent 1 values item 2 at 32, and item 1 at 26, which are both better than their next option for item 3. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1, where it has a higher relative value.

4. Finally, Agent 0 can be allocated item 1 with a value of 19, as it's their next highest available option.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
