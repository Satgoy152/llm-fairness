Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  40  52  76
1   4  87  45  63
2  36  46  10  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item when possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 63

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 65

To ensure fairness and maximize individual valuations, we can proceed as follows:

1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as it's the highest value for Agent 0 (76).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it's the highest value for Agent 1 (87).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as it's the highest value for Agent 2 (36).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it gives a good value (45), and Agent 1 has a low value for Item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
