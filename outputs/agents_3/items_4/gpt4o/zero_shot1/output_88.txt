Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  10  96  25
1  91  58  36  31
2   8  34   3   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations, we can use a method that considers the highest valuations first and ensures each agent receives at least some value from their allocations. 

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 25

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 31

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 5

To ensure a fair allocation, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation from any agent, ensuring each allocation maximizes the total valuation.

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2 at 96. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0 at 91. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Now, the remaining items are Item 1 and Item 3.
4. Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for Item 1 at 58. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for Item 3 at 25. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": []
}
```
