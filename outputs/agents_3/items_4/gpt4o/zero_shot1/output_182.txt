Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  60  58  68
1   7  88   5   0
2  51   2  72  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 88  5  0]
 [51  2 72 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A fair allocation is one where each agent receives items that maximize their total value according to their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [48, 60, 58, 68]
- Agent 1 values: [7, 88, 5, 0]
- Agent 2 values: [51, 2, 72, 50]

To achieve a fair allocation, we will try to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

### Steps:
1. **Assign the highest value item to each agent**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. **Optimize remaining allocations**: Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed and maximize total satisfaction.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (68).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (88).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (72).
  
So, assign:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

This leaves item 0 unallocated. We assign it to the agent who has the second highest valuation for an unallocated item, which is Agent 2 for item 0 (value 51). This maximizes the total value across all agents.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby maximizing the overall satisfaction given the constraints.
