Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  42  66  50
1  61  52  58  32
2  93  81  60   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. 

Let's evaluate the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 (89), Item 1 (42), Item 2 (66), Item 3 (50)
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 (61), Item 1 (52), Item 2 (58), Item 3 (32)
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 (93), Item 1 (81), Item 2 (60), Item 3 (0)

A fair allocation can be made by ensuring each agent gets the item they value the most, as long as no items are duplicated in allocations. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 gets Item 0, as it's their highest value.
2. Agent 1 gets Item 2, as it’s one of the higher values remaining and the highest available for them.
3. Agent 2 gets Item 1, as it’s their next highest valued item.

Now, we have one item left (Item 3) and we need to allocate it fairly. Agent 0 has already received an item, and Agent 1 values Item 3 more than Agent 2 does. So, it makes sense to allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 1

Now, let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
