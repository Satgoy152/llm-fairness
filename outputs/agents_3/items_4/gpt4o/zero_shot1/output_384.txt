Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  13  82  47
1  30   6   0  40
2  47  13  40  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum" or "maximum happiness" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would work:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (tie, but can allocate to Agent 0)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 0
   - Agent 2 values it at 40
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 47
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 50
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

After allocating based on the highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1 gets no items
- Agent 2 gets Items 0 and 3

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
