Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  25  47   6
1  70  54  10  29
2  28  91  39  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for every item and aim for an allocation where each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or at least a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 6

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 29

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 42

To make a fair allocation, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

A possible allocation strategy:
1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it the highest at 91).
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 75, which is their highest valuation).
3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 29, which is the highest among the remaining unchosen items for Agent 1).
4. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 47, which is next after Item 0).

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one item based on their preferences, while maximizing the total value for each agent. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
