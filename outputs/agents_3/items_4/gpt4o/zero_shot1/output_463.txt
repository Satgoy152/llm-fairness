Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  78  86   4  37
1  31  86  21  17
2   4  85  28   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and each item is allocated to only one agent. We need to allocate exactly 4 items in total. Here’s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.

Given that item 1 is highly valued by all agents, it should be prioritized in the allocation. Let's try to allocate by maximizing each agent’s happiness:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 78).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 85).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 21).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 17).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. Here’s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
