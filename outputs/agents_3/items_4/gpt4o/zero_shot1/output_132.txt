Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  30  56  81
1  94  60  22  25
2  13  37  73  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 30.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Check allocation fairness:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 0.
   - Agent 2 gets Items 2 and 3.

With this allocation, each item is given to the agent who values it most, and each agent gets at least one item. The total number of allocated items is 4, matching the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
