Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  51  25  93
1  71  36  77  54
2  81  16  94  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are assigned.

Let's look at the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values: [47, 51, 25, 93]
- Agent 1 values: [71, 36, 77, 54]
- Agent 2 values: [81, 16, 94, 19]

We need to allocate the items in such a way that the total value for each agent is as high as possible while ensuring that all items are distributed.

A possible allocation might be:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 3 by Agent 0: 93).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 2 by Agent 2: 94).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value for item 1 by Agent 0: 51).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 0 by Agent 1: 71).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets items in a way that maximizes their valuations.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
