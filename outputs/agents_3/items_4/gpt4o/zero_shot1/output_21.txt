Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  96  40  87
1  88  31  66  17
2  71  43  10  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:
- Agent 0 values items as follows: 0: 92, 1: 96, 2: 40, 3: 87
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 0: 88, 1: 31, 2: 66, 3: 17
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 0: 71, 1: 43, 2: 10, 3: 23

A possible strategy is to assign each agent the item they value the most, while also considering overall fairness and maximizing total value.

Allocation steps:
1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (96), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (88), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 second-highest (71), but item 0 is already assigned. The next highest value for agent 2 is item 1 (43), but it's also assigned. The next is item 3 (23), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. The remaining item is item 2, which can be assigned to the agent who values it the most among those who have not received any items yet. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (66) among the remaining, but they already have item 0. Agent 0, who values it at 40, doesn't have two items yet. So, assign item 2 to agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
