Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  81   2  45
1  35  52  48   5
2  41  54  36  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want each agent to receive items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3, but since agent 0 also values it significantly and agent 2 already has other high-value options, we can adjust accordingly.

A fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it's their highest value item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it's their highest value item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it maximizes their valuation.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they also value it significantly as their next highest after item 1.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while all items are fairly distributed.
