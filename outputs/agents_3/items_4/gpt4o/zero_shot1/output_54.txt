Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  40  18  84
1  62   4  55   9
2  79   0  96  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will try to allocate items such that each agent's total value is as high as possible.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [71, 40, 18, 84]
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (84)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [62, 4, 55, 9]
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (62)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [79, 0, 96, 62]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (96)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest value preference:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 3
- **Agent 1** gets Item 0
- **Agent 2** gets Item 2

Now, we have one item left to allocate, which is Item 1. We'll allocate it to the agent who values it the most and hasnâ€™t received any other higher-valued item.

- **Agent 0** values Item 1 at 40, **Agent 1** values it at 4, and **Agent 2** values it at 0.
- Therefore, **Agent 0** should receive Item 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
