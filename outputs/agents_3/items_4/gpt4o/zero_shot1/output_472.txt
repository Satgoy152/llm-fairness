Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  34  24   6
1  33   2  33  63
2  25  63   8  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 6

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 63

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 25

A potential fair allocation can be achieved by assigning:

1. Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by Agent 0 (54) and less so by others.
2. Item 3 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by Agent 1 (63) and less so by others.
3. Item 1 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued by Agent 2 (63) and less so by others.
4. Item 2 can go to any agent, but considering Agent 1 values it at 33, this gives Agent 1 a fair share.

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item and the total valuation is maximized.

Allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
