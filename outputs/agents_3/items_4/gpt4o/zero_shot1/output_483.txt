Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  14  27  33
1  24  77  33  58
2  30  95  27  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and their preferences are respected as much as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [30, 14, 27, 33]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (33)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [24, 77, 33, 58]
   - Highest value: Item 1 (77)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [30, 95, 27, 66]
   - Highest value: Item 1 (95), but since it's already taken by Agent 1, next highest available is Item 3 (66)

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2's next highest value after Item 1 is Item 0).

Now, let's check if all items are allocated and if all agents have at least one item:

- Item 2 is not yet allocated. Assign it to Agent 0, who still has room and values it next highest after their currently allocated item.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation respects the highest preferences as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
