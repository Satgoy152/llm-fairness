Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  25  58  38
1  80  55  22  82
2  96  74  98  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The valuations are as follows:
- Agent 0: Item 0: 82, Item 1: 25, Item 2: 58, Item 3: 38
- Agent 1: Item 0: 80, Item 1: 55, Item 2: 22, Item 3: 82
- Agent 2: Item 0: 96, Item 1: 74, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 26

Let's allocate the items to agents by choosing the highest value available for each item, ensuring no agent receives more than one item unless necessary:

1. Item 0:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 96.

2. Item 1:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 74.

3. Item 2:
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 98.

Given that Agent 2 has received three items, we need to allocate the last item fairly to another agent.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 82.

With this allocation, we are ensuring that the items are distributed based on the highest valuations while also considering fairness.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives no items, Agent 1 receives Item 3, and Agent 2 receives Items 0, 1, and 2.
