Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  69  69  79
1   4  43  47  17
2  42  66  26  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 43 47 17]
 [42 66 26 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. First, let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items to maximize total satisfaction:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [16, 69, 69, 79]
- Agent 1: [4, 43, 47, 17]
- Agent 2: [42, 66, 26, 97]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 3**: This has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (97). Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 0**: This is most valued by Agent 2 (42), but since Agent 2 already received an item, consider other agents. Agent 0 values it at 16 and Agent 1 at 4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 1**: Highest value is from Agent 0 (69). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 2**: Highest value is also from Agent 0 (69), but since Agent 0 has received two items, we should assign it to another agent. Agent 1 values it at 47, and Agent 2 at 26. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [3]

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
