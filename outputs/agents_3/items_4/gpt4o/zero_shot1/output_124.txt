Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  84  76  96  38
1  96  16  29  28
2  25  25  53  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm to ensure that each item goes to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 84
  - Agent 1 values it at 96
  - Agent 2 values it at 25
  
  Agent 1 values item 0 the most.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 76
  - Agent 1 values it at 16
  - Agent 2 values it at 25
  
  Agent 0 values item 1 the most.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 96
  - Agent 1 values it at 29
  - Agent 2 values it at 53
  
  Agent 0 values item 2 the most.

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 38
  - Agent 1 values it at 28
  - Agent 2 values it at 43
  
  Agent 2 values item 3 the most.

Now, let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 1
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0
- Item 2 goes to Agent 0
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
