Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  61   2   1  95
1  36  13  19  14
2  32  69   6  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 4 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 95

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 14

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 25

A fair allocation would involve distributing these items such that the total value for each agent is relatively balanced given their preferences.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign items based on highest individual valuations that are not in conflict:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 1.
3. Agent 1 values item 2 relatively more than others.
4. Finally, Agent 0 values item 0 more than other agents.

Let's assign:
- Item 3 to Agent 0
- Item 1 to Agent 2
- Item 2 to Agent 1
- Item 0 to Agent 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value relative to others, given the constraint that all items must be allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
