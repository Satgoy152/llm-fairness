Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  35  66  61
1   0  57  94  30
2  27   4  97  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items to maximize satisfaction.

Let's assess the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [48, 35, 66, 61]  
Agent 1's valuations: [0, 57, 94, 30]  
Agent 2's valuations: [27, 4, 97, 60]  

The goal is to allocate each item to maximize the combined value for the agents, ensuring that each gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 2 has the highest valuation from agent 2 (97), so give item 2 to agent 2.
2. Item 0 has the next highest valuation from agent 0 (48), so give item 0 to agent 0.
3. Item 1 has the highest valuation from agent 1 (57), so give item 1 to agent 1.
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (61), but agent 0 already has item 0, so give item 3 to agent 2, who values it at 60.

Thus, the allocation is complete, and each agent has received items as fairly as possible based on the given valuations.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
