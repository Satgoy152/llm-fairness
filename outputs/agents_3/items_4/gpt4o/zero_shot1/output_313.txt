Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  32   0   2
1  16  73  52  60
2  49  51   9  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider their valuations such that each agent gets at least one item if possible and the overall allocation is fair in terms of maximizing total value or equitable distribution.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 74.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 73.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 at 51, but item 0 at 49, which is also significant.

A potential fair allocation strategy could be to maximize each agent's highest valued item first, then allocate any remaining items to balance the distribution.

Allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (valued at 74)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (valued at 73)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (valued at 29, which is the highest remaining value for Agent 2 after item 0)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (valued at 52, which is the highest remaining value for Agent 1 after item 1)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and it also tries to respect their high valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
