Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  41  64  48  90
1  98  30  45  88
2  98  65  37  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values for items: 41, 64, 48, 90
   - Highest value for item 3 (90)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values for items: 98, 30, 45, 88
   - Highest value for item 0 (98)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values for items: 98, 65, 37, 10
   - Highest value for item 0 (98), but since it's already assigned, the next highest value is for item 1 (65)

By assigning items based on the highest valuations, we can aim for a fair allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2

Now, we have one item left (item 2). We should assign it to the agent who values it the most among the remaining unassigned items:

- Agent 0's remaining items: [41, 48]
- Agent 1's remaining items: [30, 45]
- Agent 2's remaining items: [37, 10]

Item 2 should be assigned to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values item 2 highest among the others at 48.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
