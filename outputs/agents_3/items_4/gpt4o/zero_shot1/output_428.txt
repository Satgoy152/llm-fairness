Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  38  71  81
1  95   0  32   0
2  59  25  15  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring all items are distributed.

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3
0  79  38  71  81
1  95   0  32   0
2  59  25  15  33
```

Let's approach the allocation by considering the highest valuations first:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (value 81)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (value 79)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value 95)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value 59) - already allocated
   - Next highest: Item 3 (value 33) - already allocated
   - Next highest: Item 1 (value 25)

To allocate fairly:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for an unallocated item).

Here's the result of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
