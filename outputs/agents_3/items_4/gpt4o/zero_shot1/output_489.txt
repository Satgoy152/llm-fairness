Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  43  88  26
1  60  14  60  43
2  70  12  14   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a potential fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (88).
   - Therefore, allocate Item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 and Item 2 have the same valuation of 60 for agent 1. Since Item 2 is already allocated, consider Item 0.
   - Therefore, allocate Item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 has the highest valuation for agent 2 (70), but it is already allocated.
   - The next highest valuation is item 1 (12).
   - Therefore, allocate Item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 3 is left unallocated. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (43) among those not yet assigned this item.
   - Therefore, allocate Item 3 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
