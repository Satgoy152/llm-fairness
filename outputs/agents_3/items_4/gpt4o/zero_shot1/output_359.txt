Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  79  69  40
1  69  72  34  92
2  94  97  20  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

Agent 0:
- Values: Item 0: 26, Item 1: 79, Item 2: 69, Item 3: 40

Agent 1:
- Values: Item 0: 69, Item 1: 72, Item 2: 34, Item 3: 92

Agent 2:
- Values: Item 0: 94, Item 1: 97, Item 2: 20, Item 3: 49

To maximize the allocation:

1. Agent 0 should get the item with the highest value for them. Item 1 has the highest value (79).
2. Agent 1 should get the item with the highest value for them that hasn't been allocated. Item 3 has the highest value (92).
3. Agent 2 should get the item with the highest value for them that hasn't been allocated. Item 0 has the highest value (94).

After these allocations, we have one item left (Item 2), and it should be allocated to any of the agents to balance the distribution if possible:

4. Check remaining item (Item 2) valuations:
   - Agent 0: 69
   - Agent 1: 34
   - Agent 2: 20

Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 0 since they value it the most among the remaining options.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
