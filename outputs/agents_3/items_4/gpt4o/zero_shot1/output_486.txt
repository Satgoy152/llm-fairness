Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  92  69  15
1  47   0  52  57
2  71  95  64  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total satisfaction across all agents by assigning items based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [36, 92, 69, 15]
   - Agent 1: [47, 0, 52, 57]
   - Agent 2: [71, 95, 64, 72]

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Value:**
   - Identify the highest value for each item across all agents and assign the item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is 71 by Agent 2.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 69 by Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 72 by Agent 2.

Given this strategy, we see that Agent 2 values Items 0, 1, and 3 the most, while Agent 0 values Item 2 the most. Therefore, the allocation can be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each item is allocated to one agent. The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
