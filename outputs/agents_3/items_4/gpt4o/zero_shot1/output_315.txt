Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  61  76  82
1  21  10  41  93
2  42   9  95  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 61 76 82]
 [21 10 41 93]
 [42  9 95 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A fair allocation aims to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items as [32, 61, 76, 82]
- Agent 1: Values items as [21, 10, 41, 93]
- Agent 2: Values items as [42, 9, 95, 92]

We can use a simple approach to allocate items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (42).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (61).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (95).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (93).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 receives item [1].
- Agent 1 receives item [3].
- Agent 2 receives items [0, 2].

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
