Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  75  97  52
1   4  56  76  45
2  69  21  57   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible solution:

1. Agent 0 values items as follows: 
   - Item 0: 13
   - Item 1: 75
   - Item 2: 97
   - Item 3: 52

2. Agent 1 values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 4
   - Item 1: 56
   - Item 2: 76
   - Item 3: 45

3. Agent 2 values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 69
   - Item 1: 21
   - Item 2: 57
   - Item 3: 8

Let's assign the items to maximize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (97), so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values Item 2 (76), but it is already assigned. The next highest value for Agent 1 is Item 1 (56), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values Item 0 (69), so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- The remaining item is Item 3. Agent 0 values Item 3 at 52, which is higher than the other agents' valuations for this item, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

The allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0

Presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
