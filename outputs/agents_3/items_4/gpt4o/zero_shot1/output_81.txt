Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  12  20  23
1  28  47  50  23
2  11  13  47   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. We will use a simple heuristic approach to make the allocations based on the highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets some items.

Let's look at the table to determine the best allocations:

```
Agent 0: 91, 12, 20, 23
Agent 1: 28, 47, 50, 23
Agent 2: 11, 13, 47, 6
```

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (91), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (50) the most, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 (47), but since it's already assigned, let's consider item 1 (13) for agent 2.
4. Now, assign the remaining item 3 to the agent who values it the highest among the remaining unassigned agents. Item 3 is valued equally (23) by agents 0 and 1.

Given the above analysis, to ensure each agent gets at least one item, we will assign:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 0 (since they have the highest single valuation for an item, which is already assigned): Item 3

Thus, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
