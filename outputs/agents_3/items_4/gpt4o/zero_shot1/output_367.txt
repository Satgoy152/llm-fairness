Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  61  42  60
1  57  50   2  50
2  44  34  43  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest at 75, so it's reasonable to allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 3 (both valued at 50). To balance value distribution, we can assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest at 43, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Now only item 1 is left unallocated. Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 1 after Agent 1, but since Agent 1 already has an item, we can allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to balance out the total number of items among agents.

This allocation considers each agent's highest valued item and tries to ensure a fair distribution. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
