Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  50   3  38  21
1  84  34  27  75
2  41  68  30  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation, ensuring that each agent gets allocated a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one possible solution:

1. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest at 84, and no other agent values item 0 higher. Therefore, we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest at 68, and no other agent values item 1 higher. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest at 38, and no other agent values item 2 higher. Therefore, we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
4. For item 3, agent 1 values it at 75, which is higher than the valuation from other agents. Therefore, we allocate item 3 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while all items are allocated.
