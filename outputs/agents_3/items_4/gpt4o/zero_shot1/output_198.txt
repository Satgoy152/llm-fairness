Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  46  15  43
1  74  76  54  61
2  12  12  26  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 76 54 61]
 [12 12 26 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: `[20, 46, 15, 43]`
- Agent 1 values: `[74, 76, 54, 61]`
- Agent 2 values: `[12, 12, 26, 94]`

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate items such that each agent maximizes their total value:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (76) and item 0 (74). To ensure the best allocation, we should consider giving them one of these high-value items.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (94), so we should prioritize giving them this item.
3. **Agent 0** has moderately high values but significantly lower compared to Agent 1 and Agent 2's top preferences.

A fair allocation could be:

- Allocate **item 1** to **Agent 1** (value 76 for Agent 1).
- Allocate **item 3** to **Agent 2** (value 94 for Agent 2).
- Allocate **item 0** to **Agent 1** (value 74 for Agent 1).
- Allocate **item 2** to **Agent 0** (value 15 for Agent 0).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 15 (item 2)
- Agent 1: 150 (items 0 and 1)
- Agent 2: 94 (item 3)

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
