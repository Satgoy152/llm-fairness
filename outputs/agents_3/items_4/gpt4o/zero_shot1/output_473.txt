Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  56  53  38
1  52  35   5  93
2   7  78   1  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and find a way to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for all agents, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [74, 56, 53, 38]
Agent 1: [52, 35,  5, 93]
Agent 2: [ 7, 78,  1, 54]
```

To maximize the fairness and overall satisfaction, we can assign each agent the item they value the most without repeating allocations:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 74.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 93.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 78.

After assigning these items, we have 1 item left (item 2).

For the remaining allocation, we look at the remaining items and allocate them to the agent who values them the most and has not already reached their fair share:

- Item 2 is left, and Agent 0 values it the most with a valuation of 53.

Therefore, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
