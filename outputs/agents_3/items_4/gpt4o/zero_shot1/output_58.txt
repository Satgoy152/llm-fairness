Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  53  58  64
1  32  39  83  58
2  15  52  61  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and select the one that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents.

2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values: 20, 53, 58, 64
- Agent 1 values: 32, 39, 83, 58
- Agent 2 values: 15, 52, 61, 67

By reviewing the values, we can attempt to allocate the items to maximize the total value:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 32)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 53)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 83)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 67)

This ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 item 1, Agent 1 items 0 and 2, and Agent 2 item 3.
