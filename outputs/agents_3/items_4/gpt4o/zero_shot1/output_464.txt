Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  67  86  66
1  78  66  56  83
2  25  24  94  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (86) compared to other agents' valuations.

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for Item 3 (83), which is higher than other agents' valuations for that item.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (94), but since Agent 0 has already been allocated Item 2, we will look for the next best option. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for Item 0 (25) compared to other items that haven't been allocated yet.

4. Finally, Item 1 remains, and it can be allocated to Agent 0, who has the highest remaining valuation for it.

After this allocation process, the distribution of items is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
