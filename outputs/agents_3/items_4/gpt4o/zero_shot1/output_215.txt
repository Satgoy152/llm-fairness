Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  43  49  50
1  32  41  81  59
2  70  62  39  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use the "maximum sum allocation" or "max-sum" method, which aims to maximize the total value of the allocations.

Let's look at the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  82  43  49  50
1  32  41  81  59
2  70  62  39  61
```

To allocate the items fairly, we can proceed as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highest at 82.
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it highest at 81.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 62.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 has already received one high-value item, and it values item 3 at 50, maximizing the remaining satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
