Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  93  84  29
1  76  32  59  61
2   6  14  27  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can look for a way to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total value for each agent is reasonably balanced. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 (93) the highest among all agents for any item, so let's allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation of item 0 (76), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. For item 2, agent 0 has the highest valuation (84), but since agent 0 already has item 1, let's consider agent 1 for item 2, who values it at 59.
4. Finally, item 3 can be allocated to agent 2, who has a valuation of 10 for it, although it's not the highest, it ensures agent 2 gets an item as well.

This allocation considers both maximizing valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
