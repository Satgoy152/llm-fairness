Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  55   3  80
1  71  94  60  18
2  99  43  12  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 48
   - Item 1: Value 55
   - Item 2: Value 3
   - Item 3: Value 80

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: Value 71
   - Item 1: Value 94
   - Item 2: Value 60
   - Item 3: Value 18

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: Value 99
   - Item 1: Value 43
   - Item 2: Value 12
   - Item 3: Value 12

Maximizing valuations while ensuring a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 3 (80).
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 1 (94).
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (99).

At this point, we still need to allocate Item 2. The highest remaining valuation for Item 2 is by Agent 1 (60), who already has Item 1. Therefore, we can allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 as well.

Thus, the allocation that maximizes total valuations while ensuring fairness is:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 0

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
