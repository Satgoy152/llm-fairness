Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  64  18  90
1  25  76  42  62
2  32  44  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can achieve this by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how the allocation could be determined:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 8.
   - Agent 1 values it at 25.
   - Agent 2 values it at 32.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 32).

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 64.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Agent 2 values it at 44.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 76).

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Agent 2 values it at 87.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 87).

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Agent 2 values it at 86.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 90).

The allocations based on the above logic are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed to the agents who value them the most, maximizing overall satisfaction.
