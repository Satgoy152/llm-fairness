Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  84  10   3
1   2  65  52  68
2  50  74  20   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value across all agents. This is a form of the "maximum weighted matching" problem, where each agent should receive a set of items such that the overall satisfaction (in terms of value) is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (84)
   - Second choice: Item 0 (48)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (68)
   - Second choice: Item 2 (52)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (74)
   - Second choice: Item 0 (50)

Let's try to allocate in a way that maximizes satisfaction:

- Agent 0 should get Item 1, as it has the highest value for it.
- Agent 1 should get Item 3, as it has the highest value for it.
- Agent 2 should get Item 0, since it's still available and they value it highly.
- The remaining item, Item 2, can be given to Agent 1, who values it the most among the remaining options.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to maximize their total valuation based on the given preferences.
