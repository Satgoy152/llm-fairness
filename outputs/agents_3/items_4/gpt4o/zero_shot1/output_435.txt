Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  40  10  80
1  83  36  49  21
2  58  95  21   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 36 49 21]
 [58 95 21  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's examine the table and find an optimal allocation:

```
Agent 0: [8, 40, 10, 80]
Agent 1: [83, 36, 49, 21]
Agent 2: [58, 95, 21, 4]
```

Let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to maximize the total valuation:

1. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 95.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 80.
3. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 83.
4. For the remaining item (2), agent 1 values it at 49, which is the highest remaining value among all agents.

Based on these selections, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
