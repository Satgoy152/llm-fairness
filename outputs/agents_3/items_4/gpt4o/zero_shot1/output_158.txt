Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  12  83  77
1  82  65   7   4
2  16  95  81  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value of the items allocated to the agents. We aim to assign the items to the agents such that the sum of the values each agent places on their allocated items is maximized.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value = 61
   - Item 1: Value = 12
   - Item 2: Value = 83
   - Item 3: Value = 77

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: Value = 82
   - Item 1: Value = 65
   - Item 2: Value = 7
   - Item 3: Value = 4

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: Value = 16
   - Item 1: Value = 95
   - Item 2: Value = 81
   - Item 3: Value = 44

Now, let's consider the strategy to allocate items:
- Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (83).
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (82).
- Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest (95).

Assigning these items based on the highest individual valuations:
- Agent 0 gets Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0.
- Agent 2 gets Item 1.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item, Item 3:
- Agent 0 values Item 3 at 77.
- Agent 1 values Item 3 at 4.
- Agent 2 values Item 3 at 44.

The highest remaining value for Item 3 is for Agent 0 (77).

Thus, the allocations based on maximizing total valuation are:
- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
