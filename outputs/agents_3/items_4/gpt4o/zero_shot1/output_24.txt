Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  73  61  95
1  95  68   3  48
2  79  58  28  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation and ensure each agent gets at least one item. Let's look at a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0 with a value of 95.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 with a value of 95.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2 with a value of 28.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, and 3. We need to allocate one more item:

- Item 1 is unallocated, and its highest value is for Agent 0, with a value of 73.

The fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, and the total valuation is reasonably high.
