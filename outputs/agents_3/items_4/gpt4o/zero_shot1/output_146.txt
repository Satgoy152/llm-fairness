Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  25  24  82
1  63  15  19  65
2  98  36  56  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the items with their values for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [5, 25, 24, 82]
   - Agent 1: [63, 15, 19, 65]
   - Agent 2: [98, 36, 56, 25]

2. **Assign items to agents based on the highest value to each agent:**
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0 (82).
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (98).
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 2 (36) after item 0 is assigned.
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2 (56) after items 0 and 1 are assigned.

3. **Ensure each agent gets a fair allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Assign item 3, which has the highest value (82) for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Assign item 2, which has a reasonable value (19) for Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Assign items 0 and 1, which have the highest values (98 and 36) for Agent 2.

4. **Verify the allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 3 (value 82).
   - Agent 1 receives item 2 (value 19).
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1 (values 98 and 36).

The allocation is fair as:
- Each agent receives at least one item.
- All items are allocated.
- The total value received by each agent is reasonable based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
