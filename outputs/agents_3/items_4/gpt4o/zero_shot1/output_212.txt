Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  33  72   7
1  96  21  26  51
2  82  24  28  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as there are three agents and four items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 96 
  - Item 1: 33 
  - Item 2: 72 
  - Item 3: 7

- Agent 1 values: 
  - Item 0: 96 
  - Item 1: 21 
  - Item 2: 26 
  - Item 3: 51

- Agent 2 values: 
  - Item 0: 82 
  - Item 1: 24 
  - Item 2: 28 
  - Item 3: 58

A potential fair allocation could be based on the highest preference for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. **Assign Item 0:** Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value Item 0 at 96, but to break the tie, we can assign it to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 3:** Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest at 51, so we assign it to Agent 1.

3. **Assign Item 2:** Agent 0 values Item 2 at 72, which is the highest valuation for that item among all agents, but since Agent 0 already received an item, we look at the next highest for a different agent. Agent 2 values Item 3 at 28, which is the highest remaining valuation.

4. **Assign Item 1:** This leaves Item 1, which Agent 0 values at 33, Agent 1 at 21, and Agent 2 at 24. Since Agent 2 has not received an item yet, and Item 1 is the highest available, we assign it to Agent 2.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0 gets Item 0
- Agent 1 gets Item 3
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 2

Let's put this into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
