Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  55  35  78
1  23  34   7  62
2   9  21  18  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned to one agent only. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 78

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 62

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 37

A possible allocation strategy could be to assign each item to the agent that values it the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (23)

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (55)

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (35)

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (78)

Since Agent 0 values Items 1, 2, and 3 the most, and Agent 1 values Item 0 the most, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 0.

Agent 2 does not receive any items, as they have the lowest valuations for all items compared to other agents.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": []
}
```
