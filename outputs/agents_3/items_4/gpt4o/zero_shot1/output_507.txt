Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  59   2  19  94
1  82  28  31  76
2  39  38  76  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuation table:

```
       0   1   2   3
Agent 0: 59   2  19  94
Agent 1: 82  28  31  76
Agent 2: 39  38  76  44
```

We aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.
4. For the remaining item 1, Agent 2 has the highest valuation.

The allocations can be made as follows:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on the highest valuation possible given the constraints.
