Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  68  84  95   3
1  11  96  23  89
2  22  90  93  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [11 96 23 89]
 [22 90 93 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the possibilities:

### Step 1: Analyze the Valuations
- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 3
- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 23
  - Item 3: 89
- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 68

### Step 2: Allocation Strategy
One possible approach is to initially assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

- Item 0:
  - Highest value: Agent 0 (68)
- Item 1:
  - Highest value: Agent 1 (96)
- Item 2:
  - Highest value: Agent 0 (95)
- Item 3:
  - Highest value: Agent 1 (89)

### Step 3: Determine the Allocation
Based on the highest valuation for each item, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: []

### Final Allocation
The allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
