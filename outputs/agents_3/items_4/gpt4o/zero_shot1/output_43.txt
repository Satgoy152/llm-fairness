Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  87  19  20
1  88  11  49   9
2  75   3   4  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are only 3 agents and 4 items, one agent will receive two items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest value for each agent, if possible.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who will receive the most added value from it.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [24, 87, 19, 20]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [88, 11, 49, 9]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [75, 3, 4, 79]

**Step 1:** Assign the highest-valued item to each agent:
- Agent 0 should receive item 1 (value 87).
- Agent 1 should receive item 0 (value 88).
- Agent 2 should receive item 3 (value 79).

**Step 2:** Assign the remaining item:
- The remaining item is item 2. The values are:
  - Agent 0: 19
  - Agent 1: 49
  - Agent 2: 4

Agent 1 values item 2 the highest among the remaining options.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
