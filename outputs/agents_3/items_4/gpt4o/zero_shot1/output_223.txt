Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  49  87   4
1   6  97  14  40
2  56  54  94   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the valuations to maximize overall satisfaction. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 97
   - Agent 2 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.

Based on the above allocations, here are the results:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

Each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated.
