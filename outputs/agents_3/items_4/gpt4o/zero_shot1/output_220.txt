Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  33  35  79
1  66  16  38   4
2  24  50  19  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 33, 35, 79]
- Agent 1: [66, 16, 38, 4]
- Agent 2: [24, 50, 19, 83]

One possible way to fairly allocate the items is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (66).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (50).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (38).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (83).

However, this allocation gives Agent 0 no items, so let's adjust to ensure a fair distribution:

Adjusted allocation:

1. Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Allocate to Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Allocate to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
