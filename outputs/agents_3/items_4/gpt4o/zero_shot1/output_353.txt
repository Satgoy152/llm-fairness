Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  61  85  42
1  18  62  84  30
2  31  40  14   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the allocation can be made:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 60.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 62.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 42.

2. **Allocate items based on highest individual valuations:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 also has Agent 0 as the highest valuation, but we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Ensure each agent gets an item:**
   - Since Agent 2 hasn't received an item, we need to allocate one to them. We re-evaluate the allocations:
     - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 has the lowest overall valuations, this ensures fairness.

Through this process, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are balanced considering the valuations.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
