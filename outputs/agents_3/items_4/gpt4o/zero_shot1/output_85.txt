Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  84  33  90  19
1  26  84   7  65
2  19  42  17  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations, a common approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method for fairness. This can be done using a simple heuristic or optimization approach. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it has the highest value for agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has the highest value for agent 2.
- There is one item left, item 0. We need to decide where it provides the most value. It provides significant value to agent 0, so we assign it to agent 0.

This allocation ensures all items are allocated while maximizing the value for each agent as much as possible.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
