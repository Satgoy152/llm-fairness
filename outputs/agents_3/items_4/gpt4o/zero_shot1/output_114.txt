Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  55  24  16
1  98   9  67  56
2  98  42  42  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent based on their valuations. Here's one possible approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values for items are [44, 55, 24, 16].
2. **Agent 1**: Values for items are [98, 9, 67, 56].
3. **Agent 2**: Values for items are [98, 42, 42, 71].

One way to fairly allocate the items is to assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no item is assigned more than once:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value is 55 for item 1.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value is 98 for item 0.
- **Agent 2**: The highest value is 98 for item 0, but since it's already assigned, the next highest is 71 for item 3.

Now, item 2 is left unassigned. Let's allocate it to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values item 2 the most after their highest choice:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item [1].
- **Agent 1**: Gets items [0, 2].
- **Agent 2**: Gets item [3].

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item based on their highest available valuation.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
