Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  80  23  84
1  70  92  66  29
2  69  10  66  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuation, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are three agents and four items, one agent will receive two items.

Let's consider the valuations and strategically assign the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: 5
   - Item 1: 80
   - Item 2: 23
   - Item 3: 84

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: 70
   - Item 1: 92
   - Item 2: 66
   - Item 3: 29

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: 69
   - Item 1: 10
   - Item 2: 66
   - Item 3: 98

Let's allocate the items:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (92).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (98).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, as they also value it highly (70), and it complements Item 1 well for them.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the highest remaining value they have (23).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
