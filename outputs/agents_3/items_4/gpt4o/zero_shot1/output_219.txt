Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  69  79  13  71
1  59   0  30   0
2  38  47  33  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns the items based on the highest valuation first. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 69
   - Item 1: 79
   - Item 2: 13
   - Item 3: 71

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 59
   - Item 1: 0
   - Item 2: 30
   - Item 3: 0

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 38
   - Item 1: 47
   - Item 2: 33
   - Item 3: 90

By looking at the highest valuations for each item, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Item 1 has the highest value of 79 for Agent 0.
- Item 3 has the highest value of 90 for Agent 2.
- Item 0 has the highest value of 69 for Agent 0.
- Item 2 has the highest value of 33 for Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets Item 2 and Item 3.

Now, we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
