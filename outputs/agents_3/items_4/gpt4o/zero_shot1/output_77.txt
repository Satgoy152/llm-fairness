Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  99  10  20
1  78  24  24   1
2  51  33  99  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the maximum weight matching approach. This method aims to maximize the total valuation for all agents. We will look for allocations that make each agent as satisfied as possible given their preferences.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 (99) highly, so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 (78) the highest, so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 (99) the highest, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Finally, Agent 2 also values item 3 (96) highly, so we can allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for all agents. The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
