Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  23  10  25
1  68  43  80  63
2  45  13  51  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [3, 23, 10, 25]
   - Highest value is for item 3 (25).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [68, 43, 80, 63]
   - Highest value is for item 2 (80).

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [45, 13, 51, 96]
   - Highest value is for item 3 (96). However, item 3 is already considered for Agent 0. The next highest value is for item 0 (45).

4. **Resolve Conflicts**: 
   - Both Agent 0 and Agent 2 have high valuations for item 3. Agent 2 has a higher valuation (96 compared to 25), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 can then be allocated its next highest valued item, item 1 (23).

5. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (80).
   - Agent 2 gets item 0 (45).

After considering these valuations and resolving the conflicts, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their highest available valuations.
