Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  68  40  49  38
1  85  91  12  42
2  16   4  87  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can employ a method that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "maximum sum" or "greedy" method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent can receive at most one item (since there are more agents than items).

Let's consider each item:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68.
   - Agent 1 values it at 85.
   - Agent 2 values it at 16.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40.
   - Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Agent 2 values it at 4.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Agent 2 values it at 87.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Agent 2 values it at 62.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most.

Since Agent 1 is already assigned items 0 and 1, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Therefore, to balance the allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has only one item while Agent 2 has one).

The allocation ensuring fairness and maximizing value while considering constraints is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share and maximum total valuation.
