Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  89  47  74
1  85  54  21  65
2  68  10  79   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a simple approach by assigning items based on each agent's highest valuation for the unallocated items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 1: 89
   - Next highest is item 3: 74
   - Allocating item 1 and item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation for item 0: 85
   - Allocating item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation for item 2: 79
   - Allocating item 2 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent, and the agents receive items that they value the most within the given constraints.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
