Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  48  50  86
1  13  44  50  16
2  64  99  10  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value received by all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Based on the valuation table provided, we can analyze different allocation scenarios.

Here's the table of valuations for ease of reference:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  42  48  50  86
1  13  44  50  16
2  64  99  10  54
```

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Item 3 (Value: 86)
2. **Agent 1:** Item 2 (Value: 50)
3. **Agent 2:** Item 1 (Value: 99)
4. **Agent 0:** Item 0 (Value: 42)

This allocation tries to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, while also maximizing the overall value distributed. 

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 3 and 0, Agent 1 receives item 2, and Agent 2 receives item 1. This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent has received a fair share based on their valuations.
