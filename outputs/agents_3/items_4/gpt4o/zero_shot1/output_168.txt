Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  34  96  12
1  78  57  85  88
2  41  74  50  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a method based on maximizing the total valuation across all agents. This is a classic assignment problem that can be solved using various algorithms, such as the Hungarian method, to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized. However, given the simplicity of the problem (only 3 agents and 4 items), we can approach it in a more straightforward manner.

Let's consider the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 78, and Agent 2 at 41.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 57, and Agent 2 at 74.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 85, and Agent 2 at 50.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 88, and Agent 2 at 11.

To allocate these items, we can proceed as follows:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it the highest (96).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the highest (88).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values it the highest (74).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the highest among remaining options (78).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value derived from the items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
