Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  59   2  83
1  18   8   5  99
2  16  96  82  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18  8  5 99]
 [16 96 82 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [18, 59, 2, 83]
- Agent 1 values: [18, 8, 5, 99]
- Agent 2 values: [16, 96, 82, 22]

We need to allocate items 0, 1, 2, and 3 among these agents.

The strategy is to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring that each item is only given to one agent.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value for Agent 1 (99). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value for Agent 2 (96). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value for Agent 2 (82). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 0**: 
   - Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it at 18, but Agent 0 has no items yet. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, we have allocated all 4 items:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
