Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  93  98   8
1  81  48  66  79
2  84  97  17  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 93 98  8]
 [81 48 66 79]
 [84 97 17 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent, and each agent gets at least one item. 

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 8

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 79

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 56

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (98) for item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (97) for item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 (90), but Agent 2 also has a good valuation (84). Since Agent 0 already has an item, we can consider Agent 2 for item 0 to balance allocations. However, Agent 0's valuation is significantly higher, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 at 79, which is the highest among all agents for this item, so assign item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation method provides a fair distribution while maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, Agent 1 gets item 3, and Agent 2 gets item 1.
