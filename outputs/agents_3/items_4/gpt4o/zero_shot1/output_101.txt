Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  32   8   4
1  26  66  54  19
2  14  56  64  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total welfare, which means maximizing the sum of the values assigned to each agent based on their preferences. One simple approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest value for each item.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Values of items: [57, 32, 8, 4]
2. **Agent 1**: Values of items: [26, 66, 54, 19]
3. **Agent 2**: Values of items: [14, 56, 64, 61]

We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 57 by Agent 0
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 66 by Agent 1
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 64 by Agent 2
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 61 by Agent 2

Now, let's assign the items based on these preferences:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0
- Agent 1 gets Item 1
- Agent 2 gets Items 2 and 3

This allocation maximizes the individual values each agent places on the items they receive.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
