Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  32  54  52
1  24   1  72  36
2  69  84  35  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value obtained by each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We can use a simple approach to allocate the items by selecting the highest value item for each agent sequentially, and then assigning the remaining items to the agents who value them the most.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3
0   1  32  54  52
1  24   1  72  36
2  69  84  35  86
```

We proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 has the highest value for agent 0. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 is already taken. The next highest value for agent 1 is item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 is already taken. The highest value remaining for agent 2 is item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Remaining item (0)**: Assign item 0 to the agent who values it the most among those who haven't received much value so far. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0 among the remaining options. Assign item 0 to agent 2.

The final allocation ensuring all items are distributed is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and agents receive items based on their valuations to maximize fairness.
