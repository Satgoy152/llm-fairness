Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  52   9  74
1  68  33  84  98
2   8  19  15  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 52  9 74]
 [68 33 84 98]
 [ 8 19 15 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here's the given valuation matrix for clarity:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  42  52   9  74
1  68  33  84  98
2   8  19  15  38
```

To determine a fair allocation, we can use a simple heuristic method to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is maximized:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (74).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (98).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (38).

However, since only one agent can receive each item, let's allocate based on highest unique valuations:

- Agent 1 should receive item 3 (value 98) as it is the highest valuation for any item.
- Agent 0 should receive item 1 (value 52) as the next highest valuation that doesn't conflict with already allocated items.
- Agent 1 should receive item 2 (value 84) as it is the next highest value for them.
- Agent 2 should receive item 0 (value 8) as it is the only remaining item.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
