Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  93  73  82
1  64  35  53  71
2   1  59  78  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll use a greedy strategy to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 56
   - Agent 1 values it at 64
   - Agent 2 values it at 1
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 64)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 93
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 93)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 78)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 71
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 82)

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
