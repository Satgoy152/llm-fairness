Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  60  44  68
1  85  85  23  31
2  71  21  22  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total utility for all agents, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and assign items step by step:

1. **Initial Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [51, 60, 44, 68]
   - Agent 1: [85, 85, 23, 31]
   - Agent 2: [71, 21, 22, 57]

2. **Assign Items:**
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item that hasn't been assigned yet.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 and Item 1 both at 85, the highest single valuation. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 68, the next highest valuation. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 at 71, but it's already taken. The next highest available is Item 3 at 57, but it's also taken. The next available is Item 2 at 22. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - The only remaining item is Item 1, which has not yet been assigned.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest among unassigned items (85), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1
   - Agent 2 gets Item 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
