Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  14  13  73
1  97  40  36  80
2  23  19  48  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 14 13 73]
 [97 40 36 80]
 [23 19 48 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's review the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

```
Agent 0: [74, 14, 13, 73]
Agent 1: [97, 40, 36, 80]
Agent 2: [23, 19, 48, 68]
```

To maximize fairness and the total valuation, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 97. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 40. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 48. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 73. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing the total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
