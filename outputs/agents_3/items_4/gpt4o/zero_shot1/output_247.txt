Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  63  17  78
1  22  25  66  34
2  86  15   9  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 78).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Remaining items are 0, 1, and 2.
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 66).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items are 0 and 1.
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 86).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Back to Agent 0**:
   - Remaining item is 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
