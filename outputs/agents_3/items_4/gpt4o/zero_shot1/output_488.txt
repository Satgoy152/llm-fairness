Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  13   8  40
1  47  58  81  20
2  92  72  50  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [92 72 50 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use the strategy of maximizing the sum of the agents' values for their allocated items. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

Valuations table:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  21  13   8  40
1  47  58  81  20
2  92  72  50  62
```

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Agent 2 values it at 92.
   - Best allocation: Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 13.
   - Agent 1 values it at 58.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.
   - Best allocation: Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 8.
   - Agent 1 values it at 81.
   - Agent 2 values it at 50.
   - Best allocation: Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 40.
   - Agent 1 values it at 20.
   - Agent 2 values it at 62.
   - Best allocation: Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

Based on these observations, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
