Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  63  18  66
1  81  50  11  98
2  30  24  90  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: [14, 63, 18, 66]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (66)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [81, 50, 11, 98]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (98), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (81)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [30, 24, 90, 93]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (93), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next highest value: Item 2 (90)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (Item 1) fairly:

4. **Item 1**:
   - Valuation by Agent 0: 63
   - Valuation by Agent 1: 50
   - Valuation by Agent 2: 24
   - Allocate to Agent 0, as they value it the most after Agent 2 has already received Item 2.

Based on the above allocations, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 4.
