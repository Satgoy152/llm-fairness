Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  54  38  12
1  41  43  34  14
2  21  85   2  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 85  2 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [3, 54, 38, 12]
- Agent 1: [41, 43, 34, 14]
- Agent 2: [21, 85, 2, 68]

A good approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 1 has the highest value of 85 for agent 2, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
2. Item 2 has the highest value of 38 for agent 0, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
3. Item 0 has the highest value of 41 for agent 1, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
4. Item 3 has the highest value of 68 for agent 2, so allocate item 3 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, given the constraints. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
