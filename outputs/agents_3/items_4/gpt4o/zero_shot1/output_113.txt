Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  78  24  73
1  36  98  97  39
2  36  69  54  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives for the items they are allocated. One common way to do this is by using the "maximum sum of valuations" approach, often done using the Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment problems. However, given the problem's simplicity, a more intuitive approach can also be used.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** 
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 36, Agent 2 at 36. Max value = 36 (Agent 1 or 2)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 at 98, Agent 2 at 69. Max value = 98 (Agent 1)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 97, Agent 2 at 54. Max value = 97 (Agent 1)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 39, Agent 2 at 90. Max value = 90 (Agent 2)

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation, while ensuring fair distribution:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 1).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 2).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 3).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 1 has already received 2 items.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized given the constraints.
