Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  83   2   6
1  56  61  12  53
2  55  34  33   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the table, we'll look for allocations that distribute the items based on the agents' preferences and valuations.

Let's analyze the options:
- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (83), followed by item 0 (36), item 3 (6), and item 2 (2).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (56), followed by item 1 (61), item 3 (53), and item 2 (12).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (55), followed by item 2 (33), item 1 (34), and item 3 (5).

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items such that the total valuation is maximized across all agents, while also ensuring a fair distribution. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value by Agent 0).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value by Agent 1).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (reasonable value for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, while considering the agents' valuations and aiming for fairness.
