Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  31  75  23
1   7  30  46   9
2  51  20  42  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the situation:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 23

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 9

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 90

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values Item 3 the highest (90), more than any other agent values any item.
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 highly (75), and it's the next highest valuation among all unallocated items.
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the most among the remaining items (30), compared to what other agents value their preferred remaining items.
4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest (51) among the remaining items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
