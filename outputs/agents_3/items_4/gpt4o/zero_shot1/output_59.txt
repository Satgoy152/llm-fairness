Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  37  32  12
1  94  13  87  86
2  19  11  86  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive. We should also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 37
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 12

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 86

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 57

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's determine the best allocation based on the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 37.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 86.

However, this allocation assigns three items to Agent 1 and one to Agent 0, leaving Agent 2 with none. We need a balanced allocation ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

A revised allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation. Let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.
