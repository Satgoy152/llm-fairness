Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  39  23  79
1  68  77  48  29
2  43  29  78   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and the overall valuation is maximized. We can use the following approach to achieve the allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to maintain fairness.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 31
  - Agent 1: 68
  - Agent 2: 43
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 39
  - Agent 1: 77
  - Agent 2: 29
  - Highest value: Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 23
  - Agent 1: 48
  - Agent 2: 78
  - Highest value: Agent 2

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 79
  - Agent 1: 29
  - Agent 2: 4
  - Highest value: Agent 0

Let's assign the items based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0 to Agent 1
- Item 1 to Agent 1
- Item 2 to Agent 2
- Item 3 to Agent 0

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest individual valuations while considering fairness.
