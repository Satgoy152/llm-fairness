Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  64  40   1
1  67  57  76   9
2  21   0  28  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The valuations are as follows:

```
Agent 0: [1, 64, 40, 1]
Agent 1: [67, 57, 76, 9]
Agent 2: [21, 0, 28, 92]
```

One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each item is allocated only once. We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 67.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 64.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with 76.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with 92.

Now let's ensure that each agent receives some items, if possible, while maintaining fairness. We'll adjust as needed to ensure a fair distribution.

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 1.
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 3.

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

This ensures each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
