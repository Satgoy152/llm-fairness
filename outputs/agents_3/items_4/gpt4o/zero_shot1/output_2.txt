Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  29  43  34
1  61  62  72  41
2  72  99  98  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a valuation of 94.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 with a valuation of 72.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a valuation of 99.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, and 2. The remaining item is item 3. We need to allocate it to one of the agents:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 34.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 41.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 33.

Since Agent 1 values item 3 the most, allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
