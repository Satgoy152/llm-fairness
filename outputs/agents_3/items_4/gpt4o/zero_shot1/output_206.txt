Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  18  17  39
1  30  65  61  95
2  30  57  13  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 57 13 15]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and try to maximize the total value obtained by all agents combined. One common method to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" approach, where we try to assign items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [70, 18, 17, 39]
Agent 1: [30, 65, 61, 95]
Agent 2: [30, 57, 13, 15]
```

We aim to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 70.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 65.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 61.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.

Now, let's assign items considering agent 1 has high values for multiple items:

- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 0**.
- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 1**.
- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 1**.
- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 1**.

This assignment results in the following allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 0.
- **Agent 1** gets Items 1, 2, and 3.
- **Agent 2** gets no items.

This results in a fair distribution in terms of maximizing the total value for the agents.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
