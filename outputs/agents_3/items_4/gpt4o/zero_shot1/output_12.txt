Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  68   0   9  81
1  99  38  65  84
2  21  93  21  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider different strategies like maximizing the total valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, or distributing items so that no agent feels significantly undervalued. Here, Iâ€™ll aim for a fair distribution based on maximizing the overall value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [68, 0, 9, 81]
- Agent 1: [99, 38, 65, 84]
- Agent 2: [21, 93, 21, 20]

We can start by assigning the items to the agent who values them the most, and then adjust to ensure fairness:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 (99).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 2 (93).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (65).
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0 (81).

This initial allocation gives:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [1]

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the total valuation. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
