Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  12  36  43
1  62  11  23  77
2  86  51  22  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 23
  - Agent 1 values it at 62
  - Agent 2 values it at 86
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 12
  - Agent 1 values it at 11
  - Agent 2 values it at 51
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 36
  - Agent 1 values it at 23
  - Agent 2 values it at 22
  - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 43
  - Agent 1 values it at 77
  - Agent 2 values it at 88
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
