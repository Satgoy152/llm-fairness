Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  90  97  97
1  63  18  94  79
2  79  23  90  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 23 90 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: [5, 90, 97, 97]
- Agent 1 values: [63, 18, 94, 79]
- Agent 2 values: [79, 23, 90, 78]

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the total value is maximized for each agent, while ensuring each gets at least one item.

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it's highly valued by them (97).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since it's the highest value for them (63).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since it's the highest value for them (78).
4. Finally, assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it gives them a substantial additional value (90), and this allocation maximizes their total value.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to fairly maximize their received value based on their preferences.
