Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  42  97  67
1  47  31  87  96
2  77  46  40  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [89, 42, 97, 67]
   - Agent 1: [47, 31, 87, 96]
   - Agent 2: [77, 46, 40, 18]

2. **Analyze potential allocations:**
   - We want each agent to receive items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.

3. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 (97) the highest among all valuations.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (96) the highest among all valuations.
   - Agent 2 does not have a standout highest value compared to others, but item 0 (77) is their highest.

4. **Allocate items based on highest valuation:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

5. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is 1. Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 31, and Agent 2 at 46.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as it maximizes their value compared to Agents 0 and 1.

6. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
