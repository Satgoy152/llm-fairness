Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0   7  82  23  76
1  63  42   4  25
2  20  99  10  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. A potential way to achieve this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can go about it:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 7
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - *Assign Item 0 to Agent 1* (highest value: 63).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 99
   - *Assign Item 1 to Agent 2* (highest value: 99).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - *Assign Item 2 to Agent 0* (highest value: 23).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 64
   - *Assign Item 3 to Agent 0* (highest value: 76).

Based on these decisions, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given values.
