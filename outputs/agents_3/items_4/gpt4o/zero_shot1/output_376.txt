Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  73  46  45
1  74   2  53  66
2  58  85  28  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items optimally:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [49, 73, 46, 45]
- Agent 1: [74, 2, 53, 66]
- Agent 2: [58, 85, 28, 93]

A simple approach to allocate items is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, keeping track of the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's examine the items one by one and assign them:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 49
   - Agent 1: 74
   - Agent 2: 58
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest valuation: 74)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 73
   - Agent 1: 2
   - Agent 2: 85
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest valuation: 85)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 46
   - Agent 1: 53
   - Agent 2: 28
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest valuation: 53)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 45
   - Agent 1: 66
   - Agent 2: 93
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest valuation: 93)

Now, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 3

Let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
