Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  39  54  70
1  48  84  54  79
2  21  28  12  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the maximum total valuation approach. This means each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 9
  - Agent 1 values it at 48
  - Agent 2 values it at 21
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 39
  - Agent 1 values it at 84
  - Agent 2 values it at 28
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 54
  - Agent 1 values it at 54
  - Agent 2 values it at 12
  - Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 have the highest valuation for item 2. To break the tie, we can allocate it to Agent 0.

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 70
  - Agent 1 values it at 79
  - Agent 2 values it at 98
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.

Based on these allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Now, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
