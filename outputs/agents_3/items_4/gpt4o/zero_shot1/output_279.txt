Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  89  67   2
1  48  91  35  25
2  75  32  22  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction across all agents. This typically involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a balanced allocation whenever possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 40
  - Item 1 at 89
  - Item 2 at 67
  - Item 3 at 2

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 48
  - Item 1 at 91
  - Item 2 at 35
  - Item 3 at 25

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0 at 75
  - Item 1 at 32
  - Item 2 at 22
  - Item 3 at 96

Let's identify the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (75)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is from Agent 1 (91)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (67)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (96)

To ensure a fair distribution, we try to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering their valuations:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 has the highest valuation and can take another item).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest preferences while ensuring all four items are distributed among the agents.
