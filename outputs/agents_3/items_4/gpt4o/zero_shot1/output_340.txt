Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  98  29  57
1  87  53   8  85
2  84  19  52  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given there are 3 agents and 4 items, one agent will receive two items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 10, Item 1 = 98, Item 2 = 29, Item 3 = 57
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 87, Item 1 = 53, Item 2 = 8, Item 3 = 85
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 = 84, Item 1 = 19, Item 2 = 52, Item 3 = 78

We try to assign items to maximize their values:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item is Item 1 (value = 98).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item is Item 0 (value = 87).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item is Item 3 (value = 78).

This leaves Item 2 unassigned. Let's distribute it to any agent who hasn't received an item or to the one where it maximizes the overall fairness:

- Agent 0 would gain 29.
- Agent 1 would gain 8.
- Agent 2 would gain 52.

Assigning the remaining Item 2 to Agent 2 maximizes the total value for Agent 2 and maintains a fair distribution.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3 and Item 2

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
