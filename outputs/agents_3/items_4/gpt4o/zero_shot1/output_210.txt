Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  95  65  22
1  14  96  23  16
2   0  54  39  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuation table, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here’s the valuation table for reference:

```
       0   1   2   3
Agent 0:  3  95  65  22
Agent 1: 14  96  23  16
Agent 2:  0  54  39  33
```

To allocate fairly, we can consider a strategy where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let’s evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 14, which is the highest.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is the highest.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 65, which is the highest.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 33, which is the highest.

Based on this evaluation, here are the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Thus, the allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
