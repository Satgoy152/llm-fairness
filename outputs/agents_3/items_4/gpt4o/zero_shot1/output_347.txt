Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  13  53  15
1  90  83  10  62
2  68  20  77  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 13 53 15]
 [90 83 10 62]
 [68 20 77 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 13, 53, 15]
- Agent 1: [90, 83, 10, 62]
- Agent 2: [68, 20, 77, 47]

We can start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item, and then attempt to allocate items so that the total valuation is maximized across all agents.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (53)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (90)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (77), already considered by Agent 0.

Let's continue looking for the next highest values for each agent:

For **Agent 0**:
- Item 2 is preferred; we will assign this item to Agent 2 for a higher value. Next preferred item is Item 0 (22).

For **Agent 1**:
- Item 0 is preferred. Next preferred item is Item 1 (83).

For **Agent 2**:
- Item 2 is preferred. Next preferred item is Item 0 (68).

Now, we proceed to allocate:

- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1 (value 90).
- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 1 (value 83).
- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 2 (value 77).
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 0 (value 15).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
