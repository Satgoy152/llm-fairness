Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  44  35   3
1  67  84  97  73
2  77  24  23  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent. This problem can be solved by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items being allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [77, 44, 35, 3]
Agent 1: [67, 84, 97, 73]
Agent 2: [77, 24, 23, 19]
```

We want to ensure that the allocation maximizes the overall satisfaction based on these valuations.

Let’s analyze the situation:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 2, with the highest valuation of 97. Assigning item 2 to agent 1 is optimal.
2. Agent 1 also has a high value for item 1 (84), so we can consider assigning item 1 to agent 1 as well.
3. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (77), matching agent 2’s valuation of item 0 as well. However, since agent 0 has a generally higher valuation for other items than agent 2, we can give item 0 to agent 0.
4. Item 3 has the lowest valuations overall, but agent 1 values it higher than the others. However, assigning item 3 to agent 1 would result in excess allocations. Assigning item 3 to agent 2 ensures all agents receive at least one item.

With this reasoning, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 4 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
