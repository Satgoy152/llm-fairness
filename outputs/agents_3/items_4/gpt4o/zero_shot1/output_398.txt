Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  31  91  89
1  52  76  50  33
2  55  16  80   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [36, 31, 91, 89]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [52, 76, 50, 33]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [55, 16, 80, 9]

A simple way to allocate the items is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

1. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2 (55).
2. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (76).
3. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 0 (91).
4. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (89).

With this allocation, we can assign the items as follows:
- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has items assigned based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
