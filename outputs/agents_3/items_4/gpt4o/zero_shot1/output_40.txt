Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  18   1  83
1  22  85  11  18
2  55  37  95   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List item valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 18, 1, 83]
   - Agent 1: [22, 85, 11, 18]
   - Agent 2: [55, 37, 95, 3]

2. **Prioritize allocations based on maximum valuations:**
   - For item 0, the highest value is 55 by Agent 2.
   - For item 1, the highest value is 85 by Agent 1.
   - For item 2, the highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
   - For item 3, the highest value is 83 by Agent 0.

3. **Allocate items to agents:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 95).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 85).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 83).

4. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - Item 0 is left, and Agent 2 has the highest remaining value for it (55) and it does not cause any conflicts with maximum allocations.

5. **Final allocations:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 3.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
