Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  82   8  80
1  88  70  35  23
2  75  39  73   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations: [58, 82, 8, 80]
- Agent 1 has valuations: [88, 70, 35, 23]
- Agent 2 has valuations: [75, 39, 73, 0]

We will attempt to maximize each agent's total value by giving each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated and the distribution is fair.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item is item 1 (82)
   - Second highest is item 3 (80)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (88)
   - Second highest is item 1 (70)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (75)
   - Second highest is item 2 (73)

Based on the above, we'll start by allocating items with the highest individual values per agent, making sure we don't allocate the same item to multiple agents:

- **Item 0**: Best for Agent 1 (88)
- **Item 1**: Best for Agent 0 (82)
- **Item 2**: Best for Agent 2 (73)
- **Item 3**: Best for Agent 0 (80) (Since Agent 2 has 0 value for this)

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [2]

This allocation ensures each agent gets the items they value the most, while all items are distributed and no agent is left without an item unless unavoidable.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
