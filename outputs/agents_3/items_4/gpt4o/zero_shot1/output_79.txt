Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  78  37  83
1  43  97  31  19
2  91  60  46   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 78 37 83]
 [43 97 31 19]
 [91 60 46  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes total utility for all agents. Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  76  78  37  83
1  43  97  31  19
2  91  60  46   1
```

We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 37.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.

With these assignments, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
