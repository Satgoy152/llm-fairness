Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  94  90  55
1  82  57  36  97
2  36  27  66  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider assigning items in a way that maximizes the total value across all agents. This is known as solving the "assignment problem" or "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph. One common method to solve this is to use the Hungarian algorithm, which finds an optimal assignment of items to agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 94, 90, 55]
- Agent 1: [82, 57, 36, 97]
- Agent 2: [36, 27, 66, 69]

We want to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 94)
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value = 97)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value = 66)

Now, we have one item left (item 0), and we need to decide where it should go:

4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 82)

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [2]

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and the total value is maximized given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
