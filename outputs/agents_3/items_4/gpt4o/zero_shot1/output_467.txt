Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  67  27  79
1  33  94  43  14
2  27  60  65  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 79
  - Agent 1: 33
  - Agent 2: 27
  - Best for Agent 0

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 67
  - Agent 1: 94
  - Agent 2: 60
  - Best for Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 27
  - Agent 1: 43
  - Agent 2: 65
  - Best for Agent 2

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 79
  - Agent 1: 14
  - Agent 2: 61
  - Best for Agent 0

Based on this valuation analysis, an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction could look like this:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
