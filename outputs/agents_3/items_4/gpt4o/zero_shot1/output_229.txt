Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  31  43  97
1  27  47   2  15
2  41  41  89  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, each agent should receive at least one item, and the allocations should maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring fairness. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. To ensure fairness, we allocate item 3 to agent 0 because it has the highest valuation for this item compared to other agents.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1. To maximize their satisfaction, allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item (0)**: Item 0 can be allocated to Agent 2, as it would maximize their total valuation further compared to other agents.

Based on these considerations, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
