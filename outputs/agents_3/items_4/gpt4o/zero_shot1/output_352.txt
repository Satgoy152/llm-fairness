Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  62  22  49
1  30  25  88  91
2  37  45  26   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and no item is allocated to more than one agent. Here's one way to achieve that:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [51, 62, 22, 49]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value = 62)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [30, 25, 88, 91]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value = 91)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [37, 45, 26, 9]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value = 45), but Item 1 is already allocated. Next highest available is Item 0 (value = 37).

Thus, a fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's received value can be:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (Item 2). Since it's not particularly high value for any of the agents compared to what they have already received, and to ensure fairness, we can give it to Agent 0 or Agent 2. Let's give it to Agent 0 for slightly more balanced distribution:

- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
