Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  49  45  65
1  29  83  71  92
2  78  58  62  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (65)
   - Allocation: Item 3

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (92), but already taken by Agent 0
   - Second highest valuation: Item 1 (83)
   - Allocation: Item 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (78)
   - Allocation: Item 0

4. Remaining item (Item 2) with valuations:
   - Agent 0: 45
   - Agent 1: 71
   - Agent 2: 62
   
   Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 2.

   - Allocation: Item 2 to Agent 1

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items and all 4 items are allocated.
