Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  33  59  86
1   1   4  46   3
2  63  27  37  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are assigned.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 86

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 3

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 92

Let's assign items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (95) and item 3 (86), so we'll allocate items 0 and 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (46), so we'll allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (27), so we'll allocate item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
