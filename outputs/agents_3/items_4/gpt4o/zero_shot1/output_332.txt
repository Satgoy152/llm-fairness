Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  42   8  15  53
1  64  65  44  83
2  93   9   3  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated. 

Let's consider the value each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0 values: [42, 8, 15, 53]
- Agent 1 values: [64, 65, 44, 83]
- Agent 2 values: [93, 9, 3, 44]

To allocate fairly, we can use a strategy where each agent gets one item they value highly, and the remaining item is assigned to an agent who values it the most.

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value in the row for Agent 1 (83).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value in the row for Agent 2 (93).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a higher value in the row for Agent 0 (15) than the remaining items.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, considering Agent 1 values it highly (65), and they are receiving their most valued item.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

Thus, the allocations can be presented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
