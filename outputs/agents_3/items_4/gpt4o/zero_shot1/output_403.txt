Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  45   6  32
1  35  38  65  24
2  32  51  28  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We can start by evaluating the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the agent who values it the most, provided it hasn't already been allocated:

1. Agent 0 values Item 0 at 95, which is the highest value for Item 0. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values Item 2 at 65, which is the highest value for Item 2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values Item 3 at 91, which is the highest value for Item 3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now we have assigned Items 0, 2, and 3. The remaining item is Item 1.

4. The highest remaining valuation for Item 1 is by Agent 2 at 51. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

Therefore, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
