Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  54   5   7
1   2  71  99  82
2  60  42  31  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the four items among the three agents, we can employ a method that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One commonly used approach is to ensure that each agent gets the items for which they have relatively higher valuations compared to the other agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [61, 54, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 71, 99, 82]
- Agent 2: [60, 42, 31, 68]

A plausible allocation strategy is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (61).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (71).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (82).

However, since we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, we might need to adjust the allocation. Let's consider the total value each agent might receive:

1. Start by assigning item 2 to Agent 1, as it's the highest valued item for any agent.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it the most after item 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 to ensure they receive at least one item.

This allocation gives Agent 1 two items because they have significantly higher valuations for those items, and it gives one item each to Agents 0 and 2.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
