Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  98   9  80  65
1   6  61  48  78
2  86  83  16  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 61 48 78]
 [86 83 16 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A good approach is to first assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Given the valuation table:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 98 | 9  | 80 | 65 |
| 1          | 6  | 61 | 48 | 78 |
| 2          | 86 | 83 | 16 | 76 |

We can proceed as follows:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 98, highest for item 0).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 83, highest for item 1).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 80, highest for item 2).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 78, highest for item 3).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is balanced in terms of maximizing the total valuation.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
