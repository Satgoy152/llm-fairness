Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  79  55  33
1  18  68  26  61
2  23  25   5  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize a method that maximizes the total value each agent gets. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the breakdown of the allocation based on the provided valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 71
  - Agent 1 values it at 18
  - Agent 2 values it at 23
  - Highest value is 71 by Agent 0

- Item 1: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 79
  - Agent 1 values it at 68
  - Agent 2 values it at 25
  - Highest value is 79 by Agent 0

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 55
  - Agent 1 values it at 26
  - Agent 2 values it at 5
  - Highest value is 55 by Agent 0

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 33
  - Agent 1 values it at 61
  - Agent 2 values it at 43
  - Highest value is 61 by Agent 1

Based on this, the optimal allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets no items.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": []
}
```
