Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  40  10  40
1  64  98  11  33
2  72  80  67  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets items based on their valuation. We'll aim to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (value 96)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (value 98)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 67)

After allocating the highest valued items for each agent, we need to allocate the remaining item (Item 3) to ensure fairness and maximize overall satisfaction.

4. **Remaining Item (Item 3)**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 40
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 33
   - Agent 2 values Item 3 at 27

Since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 3, it should be allocated to Agent 0.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while also ensuring that all items are fairly distributed.
