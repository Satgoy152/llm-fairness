Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  51  71  80
1  90  71  96  22
2  63  34  83  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. This can be achieved by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that all items are allocated without any overlap. One common approach is to use the "maximum weight matching" principle from combinatorial optimization, which can be simplified here due to the small size of the problem.

Let's evaluate the value each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 44, Item 1 = 51, Item 2 = 71, Item 3 = 80
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 90, Item 1 = 71, Item 2 = 96, Item 3 = 22
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 = 63, Item 1 = 34, Item 2 = 83, Item 3 = 41

A potential fair allocation is:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 90, highest for Item 0)
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 51, second highest for Item 1, after Agent 1's 71, but Agent 1 has Item 0)
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (value 83, highest for Item 2)
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 80, highest for Item 3)

Now, let's organize this allocation into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual values, while each item is allocated exactly once.
