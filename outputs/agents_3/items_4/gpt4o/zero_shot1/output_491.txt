Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  82  26  53
1  91  76  30  29
2   7  36  37  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, let's consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We want to distribute all four items (0, 1, 2, 3) among the agents 0, 1, and 2.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 53

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 29

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 19

To maximize fairness and ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can distribute as follows:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Value: 82)
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (Value: 91)
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (Value: 37)
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Value: 53)

This allocation ensures that Agent 0, who strongly values Item 1 and Item 3, receives them, while Agent 1 gets the item they value the most (Item 0), and Agent 2 gets the item of highest value available to them (Item 2).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
