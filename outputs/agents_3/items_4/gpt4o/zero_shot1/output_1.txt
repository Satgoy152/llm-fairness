Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  56  47  14
1  73  12  53  14
2  25  28  15  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value received by each agent. We need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as there are 3 agents and 4 items.

Let's look at the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 73, Agent 2 at 25.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 12, Agent 2 at 28.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 53, Agent 2 at 15.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 14, Agent 2 at 56.

A possible fair allocation strategy is to allocate items to agents based on the highest value they assign to each item:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest at 73.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as they value it the highest at 56.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest at 53.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 as they value it the highest at 56.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value across all agents is maximized based on their preferences.
