Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  94  73  88
1   5   5  27  42
2  72   0  82  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. Evaluate each agent's highest-valued item and consider allocating that item to them, ensuring no conflicts (i.e., an item is assigned to only one agent).

2. Check if any agent has a significantly higher valuation for an item than the others, and allocate accordingly.

3. Make sure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, keeping in mind the integer allocation constraint.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values are [76, 94, 73, 88]
- Agent 1: Values are [5, 5, 27, 42]
- Agent 2: Values are [72, 0, 82, 93]

Proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (highest value: 94)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (highest available value: 42)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (highest available value: 82)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (Item 0):

- Agent 0 values Item 0 at 76, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation of 72, and Agent 1's valuation of 5.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
