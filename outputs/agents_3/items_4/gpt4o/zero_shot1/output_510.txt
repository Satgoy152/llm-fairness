Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  92  24  87
1  86  21  70  73
2  81  15  10  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 21 70 73]
 [81 15 10 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives at least one item. One potential approach is to assign items such that each agent gets some items with consideration for their valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0   3  92  24  87
1  86  21  70  73
2  81  15  10  23
```

We will allocate the items using a greedy approach:

1. First, we identify the highest value for each agent:

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 92.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 86.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 81.

2. Assign these items to the respective agents:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Since item 0 is already assigned, we consider Agent 2's next highest value, which is item 3 at 23.

3. The allocations after assigning one high-value item to each agent:
   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 2: [3]

4. Now, we have one item left (item 2). We assign it to the agent who would increase their total valuation the most without disrupting others:
   - Agent 0: Current total = 92, with item 2 = 116 (increase of 24)
   - Agent 1: Current total = 86, with item 2 = 156 (increase of 70)
   - Agent 2: Current total = 23, with item 2 = 33 (increase of 10)

   The highest increase is for Agent 1 with an increase of 70.

5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
