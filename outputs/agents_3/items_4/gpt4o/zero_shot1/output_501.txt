Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  40  78  15
1  49  97   7  40
2  44  26  46  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 89
   - Item 1: 40
   - Item 2: 78
   - Item 3: 15

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 49
   - Item 1: 97
   - Item 2: 7
   - Item 3: 40

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 44
   - Item 1: 26
   - Item 2: 46
   - Item 3: 57

Let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that at least one item is allocated to each agent.

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
- Remaining Item 2 can be given to Agent 0 to maximize their total valuation.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall satisfaction is balanced based on the given valuations.
