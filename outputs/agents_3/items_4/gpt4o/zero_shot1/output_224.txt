Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  69  88  84  26
1  42  67  63  15
2  77  26  32  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent.

   - Agent 0: 69 + 88 + 84 + 26 = 267
   - Agent 1: 42 + 67 + 63 + 15 = 187
   - Agent 2: 77 + 26 + 32 + 86 = 221

2. Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (88).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (63).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (86).

3. After allocating the highest valued item to each agent, we need to allocate the remaining item.

   - Items left: 0
   - Agent 0 values item 0 next highest (69).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 next highest (42).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 next highest (77).

   Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values it the highest among the remaining items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 0

Now, present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
