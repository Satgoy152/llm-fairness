Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  34   2  63
1  99  77  43  41
2  40  53  51  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 34  2 63]
 [99 77 43 41]
 [40 53 51 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the sum of the valuations for each agent's assigned items. Let's examine the table and try to optimize the allocation:

```
Agent 0: [73, 34, 2, 63]
Agent 1: [99, 77, 43, 41]
Agent 2: [40, 53, 51, 91]
```

Analyzing the highest values for each item by any agent:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it highest at 77.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 43.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 91.

A possible fair allocation that maximizes the total valuation is:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 99 for Agent 1).
- Give Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 77 for Agent 1).
- Give Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 2 for Agent 0).
- Give Item 3 to Agent 2 (value 91 for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the items are distributed such that the overall valuation is reasonable.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
