Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  37  25  24
1  94  28  25  14
2  21  91   3  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's consider the highest valuations from each agentâ€™s perspective and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly at 94, so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 also values item 0 highly at 94, but since it's already allocated, we look at the next highest valuation, which is item 2 valued at 25.
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 3 at 98, so we assign item 3 to agent 2.

Now, we have:
- Item 0 allocated to agent 0.
- Item 2 allocated to agent 1.
- Item 3 allocated to agent 2.

We have one remaining item (item 1) to allocate. Let's assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who have fewer items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 37.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 28.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 91.

Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, but agent 2 already has an item. Agent 0, who values item 1 at 37, should receive it since this provides the highest satisfaction for the remaining item.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and aims to maximize the overall valuation satisfaction.
