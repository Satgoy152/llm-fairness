Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  83  51  66
1  45  56  67  23
2  96  10  53  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 56 67 23]
 [96 10 53 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to give each agent at least one item, if possible, considering their valuations. Since there are three agents and four items, one of the agents will have to receive two items, while the others receive one each.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0: 18, Item 1: 83, Item 2: 51, Item 3: 66
- Agent 1 values: Item 0: 45, Item 1: 56, Item 2: 67, Item 3: 23
- Agent 2 values: Item 0: 96, Item 1: 10, Item 2: 53, Item 3: 44

A possible strategy is to allocate items to maximize the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. **Allocate Item 0**:
   - Highest value by Agent 2 (96). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate Item 1**:
   - Highest value by Agent 0 (83). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Item 2**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1 (67). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 66 and Agent 2 at 44. Since Agent 2 already has an item, assign Item 3 to Agent 0 to maximize their total value.

With these allocations, Agent 0 gets two items, and Agents 1 and 2 get one item each, maximizing the total value for each agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
