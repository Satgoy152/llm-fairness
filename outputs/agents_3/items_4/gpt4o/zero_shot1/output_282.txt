Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  70  82  44
1  46  40  15  98
2  70  11  30  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are exactly 3 agents and 4 items, one agent will get 2 items while the others will each get 1 item. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total valuation for all agents.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 82 (item 0) + 70 (item 1) + 82 (item 2) + 44 (item 3) = 278
- Agent 1: 46 (item 0) + 40 (item 1) + 15 (item 2) + 98 (item 3) = 199
- Agent 2: 70 (item 0) + 11 (item 1) + 30 (item 2) + 60 (item 3) = 171

Next, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for any item among all agents).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for any item among all agents).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest total valuation and can benefit from an extra item).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value for any item among all agents).

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total valuation is maximized.
