Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  99  86  16
1  19  37  56   0
2  58  89  94  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We need to ensure that each of the four items is allocated, and that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's consider the valuations and make allocations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 0: 80
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 2: 86
   - Item 3: 16

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 0: 19
   - Item 1: 37
   - Item 2: 56
   - Item 3: 0

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 0: 58
   - Item 1: 89
   - Item 2: 94
   - Item 3: 52

To maximize the total utility, let's choose the highest value for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 80, which is higher than Agent 1 (19) and Agent 2 (58).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 99, which is higher than Agent 1 (37) and Agent 2 (89).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 94, which is higher than Agent 0 (86) and Agent 1 (56).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 52, which is higher than Agent 0 (16) and Agent 1 (0).

Based on these valuations, we can assign the items as follows:
- Agent 0 will receive items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 will receive items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 will receive no items.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
