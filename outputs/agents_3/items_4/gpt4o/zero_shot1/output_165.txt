Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  24   1   9
1   8  19  67   8
2  67  49  34  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for all agents, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value = 4
   - Item 1: Value = 24
   - Item 2: Value = 1
   - Item 3: Value = 9

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: Value = 8
   - Item 1: Value = 19
   - Item 2: Value = 67
   - Item 3: Value = 8

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: Value = 67
   - Item 1: Value = 49
   - Item 2: Value = 34
   - Item 3: Value = 57

Let's allocate items based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 2 (67).
- **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 2 (49).
- **Item 2**: Highest value for Agent 1 (67).
- **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 2 (57).

Thus, Agent 2 should get items 0, 1, and 3, and Agent 1 should get item 2. Agent 0 will not receive any items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
