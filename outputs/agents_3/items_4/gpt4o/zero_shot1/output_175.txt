Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  66   1  72
1  38  56   4  22
2  11  27  95  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. However, since there are only four items and three agents, one agent will end up with two items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy to achieve fairness:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (72) and item 1 reasonably (66).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (56) and item 0 reasonably (38).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (95) and item 3 reasonably (66).

Considering these valuations, a balanced allocation could be:

- Give item 0 to Agent 1 (38).
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (66).
- Give item 2 to Agent 2 (95).
- Give item 3 to Agent 0 (72).

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items (1 and 3), Agent 1 one item (0), and Agent 2 one item (2). This setup maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
