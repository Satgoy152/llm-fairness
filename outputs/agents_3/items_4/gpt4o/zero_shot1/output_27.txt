Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  31  20  41
1  68   4  24  74
2  82  62  26  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total value received by each agent, considering that each agent should receive at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent assigns to the items and try to allocate them accordingly:

   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 75.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 74.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 96. However, since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we consider the next highest value for Agent 2, which is item 0 at 82.

2. Allocate items based on the highest remaining values not yet allocated:

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, who values it at 82.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, who values it at 31.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, who values it at 24.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, who values it at 74.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations maximize the total value based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
