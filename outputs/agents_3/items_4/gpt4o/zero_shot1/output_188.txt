Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  44  22  37
1  58  13  52  48
2  48  46  97  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for all agents. This can be achieved by allocating items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item per the problem's requirement of distributing all items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   
   Agent 1 values item 0 the highest.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 46
   
   Agent 2 values item 1 the highest.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   
   Agent 2 values item 2 the highest.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   
   Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.

Based on the above allocations, agent 2 receives two items (1 and 2), and agent 1 receives two items (0 and 3). Agent 0 doesn't receive any items, as there are only four items available, and they are allocated to agents who value them more highly.

The allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
