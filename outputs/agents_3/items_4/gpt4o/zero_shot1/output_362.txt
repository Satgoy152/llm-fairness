Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  49  35  67
1  68  46  50  20
2  25  69   6  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We also need to ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has a moderate valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation 94).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (valuation 69).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (valuation 50).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valuation 67).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations maximize the valuations for the items received. The total number of allocated items is 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
