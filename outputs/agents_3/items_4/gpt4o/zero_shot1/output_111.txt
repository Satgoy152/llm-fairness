Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  69  16  59
1  59  97  86  13
2  52  94  34  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm to find an optimal assignment. However, given the size of this problem, we can also manually look for a reasonable allocation by balancing the total values each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 69
   - Item 2: 16
   - Item 3: 59

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 59
   - Item 1: 97
   - Item 2: 86
   - Item 3: 13

3. **Agent 2's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 52
   - Item 1: 94
   - Item 2: 34
   - Item 3: 14

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0:** Has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (87). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (97). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (86). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (59). Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent the items that maximize their individual valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, and Agent 2 does not receive any items. This allocation maximizes the total value for the agents based on their respective valuations.
