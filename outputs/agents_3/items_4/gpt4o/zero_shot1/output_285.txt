Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  32  63  89
1  87  21  62  71
2  43  37  16   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have 3 agents and 4 items. We'll aim to distribute these items considering their highest valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:
- Agent 0: [46, 32, 63, 89]
- Agent 1: [87, 21, 62, 71]
- Agent 2: [43, 37, 16, 8]

A fair allocation would be to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents, prioritizing each agent's highest value items while ensuring no item is allocated twice.

Here's a possible allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 3 (value 89)
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (value 87)
- Agent 2 receives item 1 (value 37)
- Agent 1 receives item 2 (value 62)

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This ensures a fair distribution by allocating each item to the agent that values it highly, with agent 0 and agent 2 receiving one item each, and agent 1 receiving two items due to their higher valuations.
