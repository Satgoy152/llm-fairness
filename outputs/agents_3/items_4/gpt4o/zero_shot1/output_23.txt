Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  86  87   3
1  17  58  10  44
2  58  42  50  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A possible approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it the most (value of 87).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly (value of 86).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it the most (value of 95).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it highly (value of 58).

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives two items they highly value and Agent 2 receives two items they value, while Agent 1, unfortunately, receives no items in this allocation. This approach attempts to maximize the overall utility based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
