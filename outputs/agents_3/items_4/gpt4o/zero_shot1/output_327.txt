Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  62  52  38   4
1  57  62  45  23
2  38  41  38   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can achieve by allocating items to them.
2. Try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate Item 0, as it has the highest value to Agent 0 (value 62).
- Agent 1: Allocate Item 1, as it has the highest value to Agent 1 (value 62).
- Agent 2: Allocate Item 2, as it has the same value to Agent 2 as Item 0 but leaves other agents with better options. 
- Agent 1: Allocate Item 3, as it is the only remaining item, and it gives Agent 1 a better total value than Agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations.
