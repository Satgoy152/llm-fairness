Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  17  39  92
1  89  99  74  20
2  16  91  45  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's analyze the valuations provided:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 30     | 17     | 39     | 92     |
| 1     | 89     | 99     | 74     | 20     |
| 2     | 16     | 91     | 45     | 77     |

We will assign items to agents based on the highest valuations and ensure each item is allocated.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest).
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 99 (highest).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 74, but agent 0 values it at 39 and agent 2 at 45. Agent 1 already has two items, so let's give this to agent 2 (45).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92 (highest).

Now, let's see the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 2

This ensures that all items are allocated and fairly divides them based on the highest valuations possible under the constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
