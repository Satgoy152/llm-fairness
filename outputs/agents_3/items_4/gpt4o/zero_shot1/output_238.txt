Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  43  28  23
1   0  69  72  59
2  28  55  16  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method that maximizes the overall value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to consider the maximum value each agent assigns to each item and try to allocate accordingly. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 30.
   - Therefore, allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 69.
   - Therefore, allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 72.
   - Therefore, allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 34.
   - Therefore, allocate item 3 to agent 2.

The allocations based on maximizing the agents' values for the items are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 4.
