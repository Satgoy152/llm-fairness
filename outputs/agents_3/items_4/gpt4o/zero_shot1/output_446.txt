Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  35  31   9
1  62  43  57  12
2  99   2  68   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents based on their valuations, we can try to give each agent the items they value the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (82).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (57).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (99), but since item 0 is already given to agent 0, agent 2 should receive the next highest valued item, which is item 2 (68), but it's already given to agent 1, so agent 2 should get item 1 (2).

However, to maximize fairness, we might need to adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Let's try to balance it:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 2 (value 99) since they value it the most.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 (value 35) since it is their second-highest value after item 0.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 57) since it's their highest value.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 9) since it's the least valued item among all agents, but agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to respect their highest valuations as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
