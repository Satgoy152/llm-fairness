Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  83   5  10
1  78  18  89  57
2  50  82  46  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's consider each agent's valuations and make allocations accordingly:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 72  
- Item 1: 83  
- Item 2: 5  
- Item 3: 10  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 78  
- Item 1: 18  
- Item 2: 89  
- Item 3: 57  

Agent 2's valuations:  
- Item 0: 50  
- Item 1: 82  
- Item 2: 46  
- Item 3: 59  

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each agent one item that maximizes their individual utility without considering other agents' preferences. This ensures each agent gets the item they value the most.
2. Adjust assignments to ensure all items are allocated.

**Step 1: Initial Allocation**

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (83). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (89). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values Item 3 the most (59). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

**Step 2: Allocate the remaining item**

- Item 0 is left unallocated.
- Compare valuations for Item 0 among the agents:
  - Agent 0: 72
  - Agent 1: 78
  - Agent 2: 50

Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (78). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0 and Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Now, we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
