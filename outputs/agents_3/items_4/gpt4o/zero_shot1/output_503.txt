Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  56   0  45  93
1  13  74  26  84
2  74   5  13  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation across all agents. Each agent's preferences for items are given, and we should assign the items in a way that aims to maximize satisfaction across the board.

Let's look at each agent's highest-valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: Item 3 (93), Item 0 (56), Item 2 (45), Item 1 (0)
   - Highest value is for Item 3.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: Item 1 (74), Item 3 (84), Item 2 (26), Item 0 (13)
   - Highest value is for Item 3, but their next highest is Item 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: Item 0 (74), Item 1 (5), Item 2 (13), Item 3 (13)
   - Highest value is for Item 0.

Now, we should allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for this item).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for this item).

Now we have one item left (Item 2) and need to allocate it. Let's see who values it the most:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 at 45.
- Agent 1 values Item 2 at 26.
- Agent 2 values Item 2 at 13.

Since Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest, we assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Items 3 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
