Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  43  68  71
1  75   4  81  54
2  86  21  47  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is balanced considering the valuations. One way to approach this is to maximize the total valuation of the items for the agents while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 52
   - Item 1: 43
   - Item 2: 68
   - Item 3: 71

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 75
   - Item 1: 4
   - Item 2: 81
   - Item 3: 54

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 86
   - Item 1: 21
   - Item 2: 47
   - Item 3: 81

To maximize the total valuation while ensuring fairness, we could:

- Assign the highest valued item to each agent.
- Assign any remaining item to balance the distribution.

Letâ€™s allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 71)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 81)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 86)

Now, we still have item 1 to allocate:

- Since Agent 0 has the lowest total valuation, we can assign item 1 to Agent 0.

The allocation will look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuations are fairly distributed.
