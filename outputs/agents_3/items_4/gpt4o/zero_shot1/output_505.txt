Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  46  49  20
1  57  80  14  49
2  27  79  63  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll use the valuations provided to make the allocations.

Here are the valuations again for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  23  46  49  20
1  57  80  14  49
2  27  79  63  37
```

Let's try to allocate items:

1. **Item 1** has the highest valuation (80) by Agent 1. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0** has the highest valuation (57) by Agent 1. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** has the highest valuation (63) by Agent 2. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3** has the highest valuation (49) by Agent 1. However, since Agent 1 already has two items, allocate this to Agent 0, who values it at 20.

After this allocation, each agent gets the following items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets Item 2.

Now, presenting the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
