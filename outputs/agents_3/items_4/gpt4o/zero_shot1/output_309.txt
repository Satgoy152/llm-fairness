Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  57  33  23
1  42  53  24  53
2  34  78  72   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that the allocations are balanced and reflect the agents' preferences as much as possible. One approach is to maximize the total value for each agent given the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prefers item 1 (value 57) and item 2 (value 33).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers item 0 (value 42) and item 3 (value 53).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Prefers item 1 (value 78) and item 2 (value 72), but since item 1 and item 2 are highly valued by others, we can assign items accordingly to balance the distribution.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Assign **item 1** to **Agent 2** because it has the highest value (78) for them.
- Assign **item 2** to **Agent 0** because it has a high value (33) for them, and Agent 2 already has item 1.
- Assign **item 0** to **Agent 1** because it has the highest value available for them (42).
- Assign **item 3** to **Agent 1** because it has a high value (53) for them, maximizing their total value.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of their preferred items:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.
