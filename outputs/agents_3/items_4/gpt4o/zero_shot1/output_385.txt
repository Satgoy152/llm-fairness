Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  24  78  16
1  71   7  88  54
2  66  35   6  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's go through the process:

**Valuations:**

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 16

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 54

- Agent 2: 
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 54

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure each agent can receive an integer number of items.

**Allocations:**

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (96) compared to Agent 1 (71) and Agent 2 (66).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 2 (35) compared to Agent 0 (24) and Agent 1 (7).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (88) compared to Agent 0 (78) and Agent 2 (6).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1 (54) compared to Agent 2 (54) and Agent 0 (16). Since Agent 1 and Agent 2 have the same valuation, it can be assigned to either. We'll choose Agent 2 for balance.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it most while distributing the items fairly among the agents.
