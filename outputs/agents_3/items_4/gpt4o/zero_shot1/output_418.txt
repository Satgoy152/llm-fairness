Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  52  94  95
1  58  32  92  90
2  21   2  10   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 32 92 90]
 [21  2 10  3]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness of the allocation. Let's evaluate the allocation:

Valuations:
- Agent 0 values items: [63, 52, 94, 95]
- Agent 1 values items: [58, 32, 92, 90]
- Agent 2 values items: [21, 2, 10, 3]

One possible approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item by any agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 21
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 2 values it at 2
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 95
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Allocate to Agent 0

However, this results in Agent 0 getting all items, which may not be considered fair. We need to distribute items such that at least more than one agent gets an item.

Revisiting allocations to maximize fairness:

1. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation after Agent 0).
3. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation after Agent 0).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: []

This ensures that at least two agents get items, and the allocation is more balanced.

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
