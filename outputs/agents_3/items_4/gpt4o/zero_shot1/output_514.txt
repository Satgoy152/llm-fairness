Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  56  52  36
1  41  39  88  59
2  66  38  78  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and only four items are allocated in total. 

Let's consider each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate based on maximizing their satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 15, 56, 52, 36
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 41, 39, 88, 59
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 66, 38, 78, 19

A possible allocation strategy is:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 56) as their highest preference.
2. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 88) as their highest preference.
3. Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 66) as their highest preference.

Now, we have one more item (item 3) to allocate:

- Item 3 has a value of 36 for agent 0, 59 for agent 1, and 19 for agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (59), but since agent 1 already has item 2 allocated with a high value (88), we can consider agent 0 for a more balanced approach.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [0]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
