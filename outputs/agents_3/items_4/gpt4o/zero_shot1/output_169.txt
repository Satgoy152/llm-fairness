Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  97   8  70
1  63  38  11  25
2  47  55  96  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing total satisfaction. Here is a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 97.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 63.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 96.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining item**:
   - Item 3 is left. We look at the valuations:
     - Agent 0 values it at 70.
     - Agent 1 values it at 25.
     - Agent 2 values it at 21.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who values it the highest among the remaining options.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated with the aim of maximizing overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
