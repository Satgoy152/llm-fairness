Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  90  80  85
1  73  30  72  96
2  14  74  92  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 73, and Agent 2 at 14.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 30, and Agent 2 at 74.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 72, and Agent 2 at 92.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 96, and Agent 2 at 23.

By examining the highest valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0** should go to **Agent 1** because they value it the highest at 73.
2. **Item 1** should go to **Agent 0** because they value it the highest at 90.
3. **Item 2** should go to **Agent 2** because they value it the highest at 92.
4. **Item 3** should go to **Agent 1** because they value it the highest at 96.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total valuation is maximized as per the given matrix.
