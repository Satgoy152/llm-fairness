Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  13  30  21
1  63  78  22  85
2  18  80   6  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 94, Item 1 = 13, Item 2 = 30, Item 3 = 21
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 63, Item 1 = 78, Item 2 = 22, Item 3 = 85
- Agent 2: Item 0 = 18, Item 1 = 80, Item 2 = 6, Item 3 = 84

One possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation of 94.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation of 80.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has a higher valuation than Agent 2 for this item.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation of 85.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and the integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
