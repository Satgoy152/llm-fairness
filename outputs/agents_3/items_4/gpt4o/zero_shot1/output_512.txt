Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  51  58  41
1  32  45  42  65
2  63   9  20  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should try to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 2 (58).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 3 (65).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 0 (63).

Now, let's allocate the remaining item, item 1, based on the remaining available agent:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 at 51 (highest among the remaining unallocated items).

Thus, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the allocations are based on the highest valuations for each agent.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
