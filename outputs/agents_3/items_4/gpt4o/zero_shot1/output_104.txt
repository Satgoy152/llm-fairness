Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  95  61  86
1  22  84  29   8
2  58  14  43   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. This could involve assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, but we will need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  25  95  61  86
1  22  84  29   8
2  58  14  43   4
```

We will allocate based on the highest value each item has across all agents:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 58, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 95, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 61, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 86, which is the highest.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 will get items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 2 will get item 0.
- Agent 1 will not receive any items as they have the lowest valuations for each item compared to the other agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total value is maximized while fairly distributing the items based on the given valuations.
