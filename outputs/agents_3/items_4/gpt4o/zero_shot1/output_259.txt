Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  40   8  70  59
1  62  25  60  92
2  47   4   6  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Check for fairness and adjust if necessary to ensure each agent has at least one item.

Let's calculate the allocations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 62.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 8, but item 1 has a low valuation overall. Let's hold on to this for a moment.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 70.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 has item 2.
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 hasn't received an item yet.

To make sure Agent 2 gets an item, we can re-evaluate item 1, which has the lowest overall valuation:

- Reassign item 1 to Agent 2, even though they value it at 4, which is less than Agent 0â€™s valuation of 8. This ensures Agent 2 gets an item.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
