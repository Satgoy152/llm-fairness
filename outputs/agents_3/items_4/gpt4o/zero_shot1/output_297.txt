Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  43   1  13
1  92  23  26   0
2  46  37  47  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent. This is a common approach in fair allocation problems.

Here are the valuations for the agents:

- Agent 0: [31, 43, 1, 13]
- Agent 1: [92, 23, 26, 0]
- Agent 2: [46, 37, 47, 97]

To maximize fairness, let's allocate one item to each agent such that each agent gets their most preferred item that hasn't already been taken by another agent. We'll start by giving each agent their highest-valued item, then move to the next highest if conflicts arise.

1. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most at 92, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most at 97, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most at 43, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

We now have one item left (item 2) and all agents have received one item. We need to allocate this last remaining item to one of the agents:

4. **Remaining item 2** can go to Agent 2, as it's valued the highest (47) by them among the remaining agents.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
