Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  30  85  63
1   1   4  34  55
2  73  23  45  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 30, 85, 63]
- Agent 1's valuations: [1, 4, 34, 55]
- Agent 2's valuations: [73, 23, 45, 30]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method known as maximizing the total valuation. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 30.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 55.

After this allocation, the items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
