Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  62  12  59
1  19  28  12  47
2  53  63  27  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent by considering their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item and allocate accordingly.
   
2. **Allocate items**:
   - Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value of 53).
   - Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value of 63).
   - Item 2: This is valued equally by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (value of 12). To maintain fairness and distribute items, we can allocate it to Agent 0 since Agent 2 already has two items.
   - Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value of 59).

3. **Resulting allocations**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 doesn’t end up with any item.
   - Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that the total number of items distributed is 4 and each agent gets at least a chance to maximize their valuation based on their highest preferences.

Here’s how the allocation looks in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
