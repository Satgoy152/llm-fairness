Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  25  57  74
1  59  52  85  67
2  52  55  72  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 47.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 59.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 52.
   - The highest value is 59, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 25.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 52.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 55.
   - The highest value is 55, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 57.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 85.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 at 72.
   - The highest value is 85, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 74.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 67.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 95.
   - The highest value is 95, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
