Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0   1   2  57  34
1   3  44  95  15
2  52  13  66  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their total valuation, we can use the concept of maximizing the total sum of preferences for each agent. One way to approach this is by ensuring that each agent gets the item that they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 1, 2, 57, 34
Agent 1: 3, 44, 95, 15
Agent 2: 52, 13, 66, 63
```

We will allocate the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (57).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (95), but since Agent 0 already takes item 2, we look next, and Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (44).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (66), but since Agent 0 takes item 2, we look next, and Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (63).

Now we have:
- Agent 0 with item 2
- Agent 1 with item 1
- Agent 2 with item 3

The remaining item is 0, which can be given to any agent. To balance the number of items among the agents, we can give item 0 to Agent 1, as they have the next highest preference for item 0 (value 3), ensuring fairness in allocation.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
