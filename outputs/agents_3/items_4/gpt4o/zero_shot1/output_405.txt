Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  41  28  28  80
1  65  94  56  93
2  89   4  26  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. Let's analyze the valuations and make a decision:

**Valuation matrix:**

|       | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0 | 41     | 28     | 28     | 80     |
| Agent 1 | 65     | 94     | 56     | 93     |
| Agent 2 | 89     | 4      | 26     | 23     |

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 80, Agent 1 at 93, and Agent 2 at 23. Allocating to Agent 1 gives the highest value.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 65, and Agent 2 at 89. Allocating to Agent 2 maximizes the value.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 at 94, and Agent 2 at 4. Allocating to Agent 1 gives the highest value.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 at 56, and Agent 2 at 26. Allocating to Agent 1 provides the highest value again.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives Items 3, 1, and 2.
- Agent 2 receives Item 0.

**JSON output:**

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and the total value across agents is maximized.
