Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  15  74  77
1  16  55  10  62
2  40  55  48  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of their assigned items is as equitable as possible. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 77

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 62

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 48
  - Item 3: 19

To ensure fairness, we can try to balance the total valuations for each agent. Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Agent 0 is assigned Item 0 (valuation 93).
2. Agent 1 is assigned Item 3 (valuation 62).
3. Agent 2 is assigned Item 1 (valuation 55).
4. The remaining item, Item 2, can be assigned to Agent 0 (valuation 74).

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 93 + 74 = 167.
- Agent 1 receives Item 3, with a total valuation of 62.
- Agent 2 receives Item 1, with a total valuation of 55.

These allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is reasonably fair given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
