Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  87   4  33  76
1  39  26  22  67
2  22  61  32  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize the total value each agent receives. We aim to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the distribution is as equitable as possible based on their valuations.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is Item 0 with a value of 87.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is Item 3 with a value of 67.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is Item 1 with a value of 61.

Now, we have one item left to allocate, which is Item 2:

- For Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 33.
  - Agent 1 values it at 22.
  - Agent 2 values it at 32.
  
Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 2, so we allocate it to Agent 0.

The allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
