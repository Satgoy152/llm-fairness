Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  65   2  55
1  16  30  86  49
2  73  77  85  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach to this problem is using the "maximum sum of valuations" method, which seeks to optimize the total valuation across all agents.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 49, 65, 2, 55
Agent 1: 16, 30, 86, 49
Agent 2: 73, 77, 85, 40
```

First, let's pair each item with the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 73
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 77
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 86
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 55

Now, we'll ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0

This allocation maximizes the total valuation because each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
