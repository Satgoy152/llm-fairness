Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  60   7  82  73
1  62  42  48  15
2   5  96  51  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 with a value of 82.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 62.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 96.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item**:
   - Item 3 is not yet allocated. Check who values it the most.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 73, Agent 1 at 15, and Agent 2 at 23.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 since they value it the most.

Now, each agent gets an allocation maximizing their valuation. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
