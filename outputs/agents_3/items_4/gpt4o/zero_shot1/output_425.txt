Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  60   9  65  33
1  11  14  99   7
2  77  37  15  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations for Agent 0 are items 2 (65) and 0 (60).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 2 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations for Agent 2 are items 0 (77) and 3 (76).

To ensure fairness and maximize the value:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the most.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it after item 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value across all agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
