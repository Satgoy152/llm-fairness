Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  10  87  25
1  74  65  30  16
2   0  12  19  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent can receive at least one item. This is a classic example of a problem that can be approached using methods like the Hungarian algorithm or by considering a greedy approach to maximize satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (87) and item 0 (80), so they should be considered for these items.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (74) and item 1 (65), so they should be considered for these items.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (59), so they should be considered for this item.

Considering these options and aiming to distribute the items fairly:

- Give item 2 to agent 0, since it's their highest value.
- Give item 1 to agent 1, as it's their second highest but item 0 is highly valued by both agent 0 and agent 1, and agent 1 has a relatively high value on item 1 compared to others.
- Give item 3 to agent 2, as this is their highest value item.
- Finally, give item 0 to agent 0, since they also highly value it and it will maximize their total valuation.

Now, let's put this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
