Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  53   6  34
1  17   7  39  42
2  72  21  89  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17  7 39 42]
 [72 21 89 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One approach to achieve this is by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items and trying to allocate accordingly while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Valuation Table:
    0   1   2   3
0  72  53   6  34
1  17   7  39  42
2  72  21  89  53
```

- Agent 0 values item 0 and item 1 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest.

Based on this analysis, a fair allocation can be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for agent 2).
- Since Agent 0 and Agent 2 have high valuations for item 1, we need to decide between them. Agent 0 has a higher valuation for this item, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
