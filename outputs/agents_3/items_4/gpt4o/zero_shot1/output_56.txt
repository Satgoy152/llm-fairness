Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  12  73  34
1  64  19  41   4
2  45  67  26  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 19 41  4]
 [45 67 26 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  57  12  73  34
1  64  19  41   4
2  45  67  26  10
```

We can begin by assigning each agent their highest valued item:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (73).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (64).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (67).

Now, items 2, 0, and 1 are allocated. We have one remaining item (item 3) to allocate. We will allocate item 3 to the agent who values it the highest among those who have not yet received a second item:

- Agent 0: Item 3 value = 34
- Agent 1: Item 3 value = 4
- Agent 2: Item 3 value = 10

Agent 0 values item 3 the highest, so we assign item 3 to agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
