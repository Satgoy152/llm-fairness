Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  41  87  40
1  55  65  97  70
2  73  87  87  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: 
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (66), Agent 1 (55), Agent 2 (73)
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

2. Item 1:
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (41), Agent 1 (65), Agent 2 (87)
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

3. Item 2:
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (87), Agent 1 (97), Agent 2 (87)
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

4. Item 3:
   - Valuations: Agent 0 (40), Agent 1 (70), Agent 2 (24)
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

Based on this allocation, we try to ensure that each agent gets the items they value most, while also considering a fair distribution of the total number of items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
