Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  82  31  76
1  82  46  81  89
2   7  35  22  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility, where each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items as follows: [88, 82, 31, 76].
2. Agent 1 values items as follows: [82, 46, 81, 89].
3. Agent 2 values items as follows: [7, 35, 22, 50].

Let's allocate items by focusing on maximizing the total valuation for all agents, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 0 (88) and 1 (82).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valued items are 3 (89) and 2 (81).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 3 (50), but since 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we need to consider giving Agent 2 an item that is not highly contested or already allocated.

A fair allocation, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, could be:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (as item 1 has a higher value for Agent 2 than item 2).
- Agent 0 gets item 2 (as it is not highly valued by others and Agent 0 has a preference for it over Agent 2).

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
