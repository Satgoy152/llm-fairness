Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  17  53   7
1  45  51  71  31
2  90  31  36  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One common method for achieving a fair allocation is the "highest bidder" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. However, fairness can also be interpreted in various ways, such as ensuring that each agent receives at least one item or that the overall distribution is as balanced as possible.

Here's an approach to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 45.
   - Agent 2 values it at 90.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 17.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Agent 2 values it at 31.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 53.
   - Agent 1 values it at 71.
   - Agent 2 values it at 36.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 7.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Agent 2 values it at 21.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

With these allocations, Agent 1 receives three items, and Agent 2 receives one item. Agent 0 does not receive any items. This allocation maximizes the total value received by the agents:

- Agent 0: 0 items, total value = 0
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 3], total value = 51 + 71 + 31 = 153
- Agent 2: Item [0], total value = 90

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
