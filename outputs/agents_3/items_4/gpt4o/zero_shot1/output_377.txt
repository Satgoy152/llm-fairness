Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  90  57  16
1  73  91  85  78
2  93  95   5  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 (value 16) is the least valuable to Agent 0 compared to others, so it can be considered for allocation to another agent.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (91). Allocating Item 1 to Agent 1 maximizes their total value.
   - Next, Agent 1 values Item 2 (85). Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 maximizes their total value further.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest (93). Allocating Item 0 to Agent 2 maximizes their total value.
   - Next, Agent 2 values Item 3 (49). Allocating Item 3 to Agent 2 maximizes their total value further.

Here's the allocation based on the above strategy:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 3.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
