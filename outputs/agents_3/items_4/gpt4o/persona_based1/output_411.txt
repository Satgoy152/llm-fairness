Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  68  75  18  51
1  28  18  18   5
2  88  94  39  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent is treated fairly based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy. One approach to achieve this is to allocate items such that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for items 0, 1, and 3:
   - Item 0: Value of 88 (highest among all agents)
   - Item 1: Value of 94 (highest among all agents)
   - Item 3: Value of 78 (highest among all agents)

2. **Agent 0** has the highest remaining valuation for item 2:
   - Item 2: Value of 18 (Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it equally, but Agent 0 gets it to balance allocation as per remaining items)

Let's summarize the allocation:
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 3 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
- Agent 0 gets item 2.

Now, let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 4 items are allocated.
