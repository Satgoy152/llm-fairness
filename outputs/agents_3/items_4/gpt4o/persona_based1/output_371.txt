Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  36  67  13
1  73  19  81   3
2  77  34  58  21
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we must distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations. We aim to allocate all 4 items among the 3 agents while maintaining fairness to the extent possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [53, 36, 67, 13]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [73, 19, 81, 3]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [77, 34, 58, 21]

We can try to allocate items by prioritizing the highest values for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items in this order based on values: Item 2 (67), Item 0 (53), Item 1 (36), Item 3 (13).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items in this order based on values: Item 2 (81), Item 0 (73), Item 1 (19), Item 3 (3).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items in this order based on values: Item 0 (77), Item 2 (58), Item 1 (34), Item 3 (21).

Now, let's allocate based on maximizing fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 2, since it's their highest value and also highly valued by others.
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 0, as it's their second-highest and a top choice for Agent 2.
- **Agent 2**: Since the high-demand items are allocated, assign Item 3, which is the least valued by others but still decent for Agent 2.
- The remaining item, Item 1, can go to Agent 0, who values it more than Agent 1.

Let's list the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Items [2, 1]
- Agent 1 gets Item [0]
- Agent 2 gets Item [3]

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest preferences first.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This distribution tries to respect the agents' preferences while ensuring each item is allocated.
