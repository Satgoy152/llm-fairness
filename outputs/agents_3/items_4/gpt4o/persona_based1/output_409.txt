Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  24  52  34
1  46  72  61  14
2  73  58  84  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we aim to ensure that each agent feels that they have received a fair share of the total value based on their own valuations. The goal is to achieve an allocation where no agent prefers the allocation of any other agent over their own, given their respective valuations. In this scenario, we have 3 agents and 4 items.

Let us evaluate the valuations and make an optimal allocation:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [21, 24, 52, 34]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [46, 72, 61, 14]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [73, 58, 84, 99]

A common method to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the "maximum sum" approach where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, provided it doesn't significantly disadvantage others.

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 2 (99). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 2 (84). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 1 (72). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 2 (73), but Agent 2 already has 2 items, so we check the next highest value. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (46), since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives Items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly within the constraints.
