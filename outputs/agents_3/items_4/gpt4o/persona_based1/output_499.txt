Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  64   6  97
1  68  64  47  85
2  48  31  43  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Here is the valuation matrix for clarity:

```
   0   1   2   3
0  56  64   6  97
1  68  64  47  85
2  48  31  43  79
```

Let's approach this allocation step by step:

1. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it highest at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 85.
   - Agent 2 values it at 79.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 68.
   - Agent 0 values it at 56.
   - Agent 2 values it at 48.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 64.
   - Agent 2 values it at 31.
   - Since Agent 0 already has a high-value item (item 3), we allocate item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the distribution.

4. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Agent 2 values it at 43.
   - Agent 0 values it at 6.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 hasn't received any items yet, and this allocation will minimize envy.

Now, let's review the allocations:

- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 has item 2.

This allocation minimizes envy across agents as each agent receives items they value highly relative to others. Thus, the final allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
