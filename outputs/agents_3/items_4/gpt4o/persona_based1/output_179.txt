Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  40  51  53
1   4  43   7  84
2  36  61  95   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible. In this scenario, it's crucial to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0: 19 + 40 + 51 + 53 = 163
- Agent 1: 4 + 43 + 7 + 84 = 138
- Agent 2: 36 + 61 + 95 + 8 = 200

We should aim to allocate items so that the perceived value for each agent is as high as possible, reducing envy.

A reasonable approach is to allocate each agent their highest valued item if possible:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (53), item 2 second highest (51).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (84).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (95), item 1 second highest (61).

Given these preferences, let's allocate as follows:

- Start with Agent 2 getting item 2 because it has their highest valuation, and it's the highest valuation overall.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it's their highest valued item and the second-highest overall.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 next due to their second-highest valuation.
- Finally, assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it is the only remaining item, and Agent 0 values it the highest among their unallocated items.

This allocation gives each agent some of their most valued items and aims to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed. Agent 2 receives two items due to their higher combined valuation, while agents 0 and 1 receive one item each, consistent with the goal of reducing envy based on individual valuations.
