Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  27  98  84
1  46  28  12   1
2  55  23  23  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items while adhering to the principle of envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation. In this case, however, due to the limited number of items and agents, we can use a simpler method: assigning items to the agent who values them most.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [86, 27, 98, 84]
- Agent 1: [46, 28, 12, 1]
- Agent 2: [55, 23, 23, 96]

We will allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 46, and Agent 2 at 55. Agent 0 has the highest valuation.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 28, and Agent 2 at 23. Agent 1 has the highest valuation.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 12, and Agent 2 at 23. Agent 0 has the highest valuation.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 1, and Agent 2 at 96. Agent 2 has the highest valuation.

Based on the above, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, thus minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
