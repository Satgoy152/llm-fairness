Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  62   2  70
1   6  31  36  29
2  76  96  86  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to find a distribution where each agent receives an allocation of items that they value highly, or at least as highly as possible, given the constraints. 

One possible method for achieving envy-freeness is using the "maximum envy-free allocation" approach, which tries to minimize the envy any agent might feel for another's allocation. However, given the constraints (4 items and 3 agents), complete envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can try to minimize it.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [21, 62, 2, 70]
- Agent 1 values: [6, 31, 36, 29]
- Agent 2 values: [76, 96, 86, 83]

We should try to allocate items in a way that each agent gets at least one high-value item according to their preference. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign item 3 (value 70 for Agent 0). It's the highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 2 (value 36 for Agent 1). This is the highest value for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign items 0 and 1 (values 76 and 96 for Agent 2, respectively). These are the highest values for Agent 2, and they are left once the other agents take their highest-value items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly relative to the available options.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations by giving each agent their most valued items within the constraints of the problem.
