Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  78  13  32
1  90  20  12  76
2  33  37  26   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 78 13 32]
 [90 20 12 76]
 [33 37 26  9]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy among agents for this allocation.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
   0   1   2   3
0  85  78  13  32
1  90  20  12  76
2  33  37  26   9
```

### Step 1: Initial Observations
- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (85), followed by item 1 (78).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (90), followed by item 3 (76).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (37), followed by item 0 (33).

### Step 2: Allocation Strategy
1. **Item 0** is highly valued by both Agents 0 and 1. However, Agent 1 values it the most. Allocating item 0 to Agent 1 makes sense since they derive the highest value from it.
2. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 0 secondarily and is the highest for Agent 2. Since Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2** has low valuations from all agents, but Agent 0 values it the most (13). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3** is second-highest valued by Agent 1, but Agent 0 values it moderately (32), which is the highest among the remaining allocations. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

### Step 3: Resulting Allocation
Based on the above strategy, here's how the items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest preferences and minimize potential envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and all four items are distributed.
