Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  44   5  65  49
1  99  96  66  62
2  35   5  82  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that we ensure fairness and avoid envy among them. The concept of envy-freeness in fair division means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

One common approach to achieve a fair division is the "maximum marginal utility" method, which seeks to maximize each agent's utility based on their own valuations.

Let's assess each item allocation based on maximizing individual agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: Item 0 (44), Item 1 (5), Item 2 (65), Item 3 (49)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: Item 0 (99), Item 1 (96), Item 2 (66), Item 3 (62)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: Item 0 (35), Item 1 (5), Item 2 (82), Item 3 (24)

Given these valuations, we can start by allocating the most valued items to each agent:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99), thus allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96), thus allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (82), thus allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (49), thus allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the item(s) they value most, making it fair. 

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item based on their highest valuation, aiming to minimize envy and maximize satisfaction.
