Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  28  37  86
1  68  88  55  88
2   1  21  83  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items based on their individual valuations, while striving for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means each agent feels that their allocated share is at least as good as any other agent's share, based on their own valuation. Given that there are three agents and four items, our goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

Let's first consider each agent's total valuation over all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [93, 28, 37, 86]
- Agent 1's valuations: [68, 88, 55, 88]
- Agent 2's valuations: [1, 21, 83, 28]

For each agent, the total valuations are:
- Agent 0: 93 + 28 + 37 + 86 = 244
- Agent 1: 68 + 88 + 55 + 88 = 299
- Agent 2: 1 + 21 + 83 + 28 = 133

Next, let's assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item is item 0 (value 93), followed by item 3 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items are item 1 and item 3 (each valued at 88).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item is item 2 (value 83).

Based on the valuations, we can start the allocation as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is equally valuable to Agent 1 as item 1, ensuring that Agent 1 is satisfied with their allocation.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuations while ensuring that each feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
