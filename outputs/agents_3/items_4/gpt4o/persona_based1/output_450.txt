Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  62   3  75  78
1  65   2  33  42
2  63  69  64  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 78

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 42

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 19

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 65. Next is Agent 2 at 63, and then Agent 0 at 62.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 69. Next is Agent 0 at 3, and Agent 1 at 2.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 75. Next is Agent 2 at 64, and Agent 1 at 33.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 78. Next is Agent 1 at 42, and Agent 2 at 19.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3 (values: 75, 78)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value: 65)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value: 69)

Checking for envy-freeness:

- Agent 0 has items valued at 153 (75 + 78), which is higher than any other agent's bundle.
- Agent 1 has item valued at 65, and they do not envy Agent 2, who has a total value of 69 for their item.
- Agent 2 has item valued at 69, and they do not envy Agent 1, who has a total value of 65 for their item.

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
