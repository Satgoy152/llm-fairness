Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  48  22  72
1   9  14  37  39
2  38  79  37  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value adequately as compared to what others receive. Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [28, 48, 22, 72]
- Agent 1: [9, 14, 37, 39]
- Agent 2: [38, 79, 37, 81]

We want to allocate the four items among the three agents. To minimize envy, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while considering their preferences.

A possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3, which they value the most (72).
- Agent 1 receives item 2, which they value the most (37).
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1, which they value highly (38 and 79), and this allocation prevents them from envying Agent 0 (with item 3) and Agent 1 (with item 2).

This allocation aims to minimize envy and give each agent a bundle of items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
