Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2  3
0  85  65  70  0
1  65  94  60  1
2  88  18  74  6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure envy-freeness and a fair division, we need to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction, given their individual valuations, while ensuring no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most, at 85. 
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most, at 94.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most, at 74.
4. The remaining item, item 3, has the least value for all agents, so we can allocate it to the agent who has the least total value so far. Here, Agent 2, who gets item 3.

With this allocation, each agent receives one item they value the most, and the last item is given to the agent with the least total value. This ensures an envy-free distribution, as no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
