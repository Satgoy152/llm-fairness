Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  80   4  76
1  43  27   9  45
2  27  73  82  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations, we can consider different allocation strategies to achieve an envy-free allocation.

Let's first look at the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 80
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 45

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 82
  - Item 3: 97

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate items to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction. A possible allocation could be:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (high value of 80)
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value of 43)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value of 82)
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value of 97)

This allocation gives each agent at least one high-value item, and Agent 2, who values the items highly, gets two items to balance the overall allocation, ensuring fairness and minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
