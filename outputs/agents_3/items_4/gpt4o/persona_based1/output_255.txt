Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  87   5  37
1  37  81  54   0
2  20  10  70  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Valuations: Item 0 (1), Item 1 (87), Item 2 (5), Item 3 (37)
   - Highest valuation is for Item 1 (87).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Valuations: Item 0 (37), Item 1 (81), Item 2 (54), Item 3 (0)
   - Highest valuation, excluding already allocated Item 1, is for Item 2 (54).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Valuations: Item 0 (20), Item 1 (10), Item 2 (70), Item 3 (70)
   - Highest valuation is for Items 2 and 3 (both 70), but Item 2 is already allocated.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 0 is left. We need to allocate it to ensure each agent gets at least one item and to balance the envy.
   - None of the agents have a high valuation for Item 0, but Agent 1 has the highest among them (37).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is relatively fair considering their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
