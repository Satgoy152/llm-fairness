Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  71   8  51  45
1   7  77  30  75
2  64  36  56  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent feels another agent has a strictly better allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze each agent's perspective:

- **Agent 0** values items 0, 2, and 3 highly.
- **Agent 1** values items 1 and 3 highly.
- **Agent 2** values items 0 and 2 highly.

Given these preferences, one possible fair allocation could be:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 2, which has a high value for them.
2. **Agent 1** gets item 1, which is highly valued by them.
3. **Agent 2** gets item 0, which is highly valued by them.

Now, we need to assign the remaining item 3. Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so it's reasonable to allocate it to them:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2
2. **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 3
3. **Agent 2**: Item 0

This allocation respects the valuations and attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent an item they value highly. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
