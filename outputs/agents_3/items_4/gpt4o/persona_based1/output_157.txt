Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  20  70  63
1  91  40  99  45
2  76   8  44  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider the agents' valuations to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible. One method is to use the maximum total value that can be achieved for each agent while considering the constraints of integer allocation.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  50  20  70  63
1  91  40  99  45
2  76   8  44  59
```

**Step 1:** Evaluate each item for each agent and find the best allocation.

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (70), followed by item 3 (63), item 0 (50), and item 1 (20).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99), followed by item 0 (91), item 3 (45), and item 1 (40).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (76), followed by item 3 (59), item 2 (44), and item 1 (8).

**Step 2:** Allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction and minimize envy.

A potential allocation could be:
- Give item 2 to Agent 1 as it provides the highest value (99).
- Give item 0 to Agent 1 since it has high value for Agent 1 (91), and Agent 0 and Agent 2 also value it significantly.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as it maximizes Agent 0's remaining value (63).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 since it's the least valuable for everyone, but Agent 2 values it the least overall.

**Step 3:** Review allocation and ensure all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation aims to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
