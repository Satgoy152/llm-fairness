Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0   2  53  84  63
1  41  77  81  57
2  76  86  44  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to assign the items to the agents in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will aim to minimize envy among the agents by considering their highest valuations first.

Let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 = 2, 1 = 53, 2 = 84, 3 = 63
- Agent 1 values items: 0 = 41, 1 = 77, 2 = 81, 3 = 57
- Agent 2 values items: 0 = 76, 1 = 86, 2 = 44, 3 = 13

### Allocation Process:

1. **Assign item 1** to Agent 2 (highest valuation at 86).
2. **Assign item 2** to Agent 0 (highest valuation at 84).
3. **Assign item 0** to Agent 2 (next highest valuation at 76).
4. **Assign item 3** to Agent 0 (next highest valuation at 63).

This allocation aims to give each agent their most valued items while balancing the total value each one receives. Here's the breakdown:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, with total valuation = 84 + 63 = 147.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1, with total valuation = 76 + 86 = 162.

This allocation gives a fair distribution based on preferences, where agents receive items they highly value.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation is fair in terms of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
