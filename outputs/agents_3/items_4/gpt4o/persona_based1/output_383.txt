Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  16  76  27
1  74  73  99  15
2  27  59   6  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which aims to maximize the product of agents' utilities.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 28 + 16 + 76 + 27 = 147
- Agent 1: 74 + 73 + 99 + 15 = 261
- Agent 2: 27 + 59 + 6 + 65 = 157

We want to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle they value highly while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible.

For simplicity and based on the provided valuations, a reasonable allocation strategy could be:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (99).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest among available items (65).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a significant value for them (28).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high valuation for it (73).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, minimizing envy and attempting to keep the distribution fair.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
