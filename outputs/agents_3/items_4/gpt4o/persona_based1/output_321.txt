Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  21  99  14
1  23  57  43  12
2  54  27  19  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free and each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value another agent's allocation. Given the valuations, we can attempt to assign items to agents to maximize fairness.

Here are the valuations for each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [14, 21, 99, 14]
- Agent 1: [23, 57, 43, 12]
- Agent 2: [54, 27, 19, 62]

A possible envy-free allocation that attempts to minimize envy could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)

This leaves item 0 unassigned. To determine the best allocation for item 0, we examine the remaining capacities and values:

- Agent 1 values item 0 at 23
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 54

Assigning item 0 to Agent 2 maximizes the total value for Agent 2 while maintaining the overall fairness of the allocation.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets at least one highly valued item, and the envy is minimized.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
