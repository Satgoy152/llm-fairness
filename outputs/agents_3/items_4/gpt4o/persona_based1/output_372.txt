Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  55  49  49
1  53  12  59  83
2  29   0  85  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims to minimize envy among the agents, we can employ an approach to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. A common method for fair division is the Envy-Free criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate the items to achieve a fair division:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Agent 2 values it at 29

   Agent 0 values Item 0 the most.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Agent 2 values it at 0

   Agent 0 values Item 1 the most.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 85

   Agent 2 values Item 2 the most.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 49

   Agent 1 values Item 3 the most.

Given these observations, we can allocate items as follows:
- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their share while ensuring no envy among agents, as each agent receives the item(s) they value the highest among unallocated options.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
