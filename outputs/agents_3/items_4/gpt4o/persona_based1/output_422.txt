Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  14  12  84
1  60   7  62   7
2  21  67  19  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent's valuation of their received items is as high as possible, and ideally, no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [61, 14, 12, 84]
- Agent 1: [60, 7, 62, 7]
- Agent 2: [21, 67, 19, 33]

One approach to allocate items is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring no envy. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 84.
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 62.
3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 67.
4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: This leaves item 0, which Agent 0 values second highest at 61.

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.

In JSON format, this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
