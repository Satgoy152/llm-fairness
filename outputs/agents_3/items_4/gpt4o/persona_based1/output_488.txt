Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  58  28  41
1  64  25  13  19
2  10  51  64   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations of the items and try to distribute the items so that no agent envies another. Here, we have 3 agents and 4 items. Each agent should receive at least one item, and we need to ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 4.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [22, 58, 28, 41]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [64, 25, 13, 19]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [10, 51, 64, 3]

To create a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the most compared to other unassigned items.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it highly and it is not the highest valued by the other agents.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest, and this choice should minimize envy.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, to balance the item count and considering Agent 0's second preference.

The allocations should look like this:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
