Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  13  18   1
1  72   9  31  33
2  88  56  96  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction (or minimize envy) for each agent with their allocated items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [73, 13, 18, 1]
- Agent 1: [72, 9, 31, 33]
- Agent 2: [88, 56, 96, 58]

We should aim to allocate the items such that the total value each agent perceives from their allocation is as high as possible.

One potential allocation strategy could be as follows:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest (96).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest (73).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest among remaining items (33).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than the other agents left without allocations (56).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy. Let's present this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: item 0 (value 73)
- Agent 1: item 3 (value 33)
- Agent 2: items 1 and 2 (values 56 and 96, respectively)
