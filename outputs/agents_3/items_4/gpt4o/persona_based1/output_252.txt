Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  74  30  21
1   4  84  13  48
2  13  51  37  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 84 13 48]
 [13 51 37 32]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [98, 74, 30, 21]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [4, 84, 13, 48]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [13, 51, 37, 32]

We'll try to allocate the items so that each agent receives items they value highly while minimizing envy.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (98). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (84). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (37). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item (Item 3):**
   - The remaining item is item 3. We need to determine which agent values it the most among those who would be least envious.
   - The values for item 3 are: Agent 0 (21), Agent 1 (48), Agent 2 (32).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it maximizes their overall valuation and minimizes envy.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and respects their highest valuations as much as possible.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
