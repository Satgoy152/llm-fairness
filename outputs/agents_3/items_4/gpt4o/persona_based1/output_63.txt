Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  17  60  26  58
1  17  63  42  83
2  51  28  52  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally achieving envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

We have the following valuations table:

| Agent/Item | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0    | 17     | 60     | 26     | 58     |
| Agent 1    | 17     | 63     | 42     | 83     |
| Agent 2    | 51     | 28     | 52     | 66     |

First, let's consider each agent's highest-valued item and try to assign that item to them if possible:

- Agent 0's most valued item is Item 1 (value = 60).
- Agent 1's most valued item is Item 3 (value = 83).
- Agent 2's most valued item is Item 3 (value = 66).

Since both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value Item 3 highly, we will assign it to Agent 1 as they value it the most.

Next, let's try to allocate the remaining items:

- For Agent 0, after assigning Item 1 to them, we can consider items they value next highest, which are Item 3 (already assigned) and then Item 2.
- For Agent 2, after assigning Item 3 to Agent 1, we consider the next highest value for them, which is Item 0.

Let's try the following allocations to see if we can minimize envy:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2, with a total value of 60 + 26 = 86.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3, with a total value of 83.
- Agent 2 gets Item 0, with a total value of 51.

This allocation attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints, minimizing envy:

- Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1 (86 > 83) or Agent 2 (86 > 51).
- Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0 (83 < 86) or Agent 2 (83 > 51).
- Agent 2 does not envy Agent 0 (51 < 86) or Agent 1 (51 < 83).

The allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it minimizes the differences in valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
