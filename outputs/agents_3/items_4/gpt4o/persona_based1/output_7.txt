Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  91  83  22
1  82  47  19  68
2  84  79  33  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation. Here's a feasible allocation strategy:

1. Each agent should ideally get items that they value highly, while minimizing envy from other agents.

2. Let's start by analyzing the highest valuations for each item:

   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (83).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (96).

3. Distributing based on highest valuations:

   - Give item 0 to agent 2.
   - Give item 1 to agent 0.
   - Give item 2 to agent 0.
   - Give item 3 to agent 2.

4. Review the allocation:

   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives no items.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 3.

5. Ensure total of 4 items are allocated and reflect in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that agent 0 and agent 2 receive items they value highly, while agent 1, unfortunately, does not receive any items. However, this distribution is one way to maintain a fair balance according to the given valuations.
