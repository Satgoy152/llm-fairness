Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  47  46  62
1  80  61  56  71
2  52  37  21  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

One method to achieve this is by using the "Envy-Free" criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Since we have three agents and four items, each agent will get at least one item, and one agent will get two items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [90, 47, 46, 62]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [80, 61, 56, 71]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [52, 37, 21, 71]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 0 (90) compared to Agent 1 (80) and Agent 2 (52). Thus, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 1 (61), compared to Agent 0 (47) and Agent 2 (37). Thus, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2** is less valued by all, but the highest valuation comes from Agent 0 (46), compared to Agent 1 (56) and Agent 2 (21). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 for a more balanced distribution since Agent 1 valued it more than Agent 0.

4. **Item 3** is equally valued highest by Agent 1 (71) and Agent 2 (71), but since Agent 1 already has two items, allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3.

This allocation is envy-free because each agent receives the items they value most relative to what is available after considering other agents' allocations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
