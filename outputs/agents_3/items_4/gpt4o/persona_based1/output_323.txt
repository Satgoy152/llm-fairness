Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0  1   2   3
0  26  3  77  87
1  74  4  57   2
2  69  8  55  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and distribute the items so that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's allocation, according to their own valuations.

Hereâ€™s one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: This can help in determining which items are most important to each agent. 

2. **Try to satisfy each agent by giving them their most valued item**: If possible, this can help in achieving envy-freeness.

3. **Adjust the allocations to ensure all items are distributed**: Check that each item is allocated and no agent is left out unless necessary.

Let's look at the valuations more closely:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [26, 3, 77, 87]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [74, 4, 57, 2]
- **Agent 2's valuations**: [69, 8, 55, 20]

**Allocations**:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (87), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (74), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the second highest (77) and Agent 2 values it reasonably (55), but since Agent 0 has already received item 3, we consider Agent 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 1**: The remaining item is item 1, which Agent 0 values the least. This can be allocated to Agent 2, who values it at 8.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations where possible, and all items are distributed.

Therefore, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items based on the given valuations, ensuring that each agent receives an item they value while all items are allocated.
