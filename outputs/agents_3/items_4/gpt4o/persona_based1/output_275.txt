Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0   7  47  25  92
1  31  43  26  38
2  42  90   1  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction and minimizes envy. One common approach is to find an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the sum of valuations each agent has for all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 7 + 47 + 25 + 92 = 171
- Agent 1's total valuation: 31 + 43 + 26 + 38 = 138
- Agent 2's total valuation: 42 + 90 + 1 + 76 = 209

Based on these valuations, we want to allocate items so that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

To achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, we can use the following strategy:

1. Assign the item that is most valued by an agent to them, as long as it doesn't create excessive envy.
2. Continue assigning based on the next highest unallocated value, while considering the distribution of total value among agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (92), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (90), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest after these allocations (31), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Finally, allocate the remaining item 2 to Agent 0 since it provides the next highest value to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 2 (92 + 25 = 117)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (31)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (90)

This allocation tries to balance the total valuation to each agent as well as possible, given the constraints, and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
