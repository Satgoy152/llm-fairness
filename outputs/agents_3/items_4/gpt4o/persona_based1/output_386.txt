Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  42  87  67
1  49  74  48  14
2  12  56  73  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. 

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [94, 42, 87, 67]
- Agent 1 values: [49, 74, 48, 14]
- Agent 2 values: [12, 56, 73, 84]

A good way to approach this is to try and maximize the total value each agent receives, while aiming to minimize envy.

Let's analyze this:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 0 (value 94) the most, followed by item 2 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 (value 74) the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 3 (value 84) the most.

To minimize envy as much as possible, we can try the following allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have one item left to allocate, which is item 2. We must choose an agent such that it minimizes the envy:

- If we give item 2 to Agent 0, their total value becomes 94 + 87 = 181.
- If we give item 2 to Agent 1, their total value becomes 74 + 48 = 122.
- If we give item 2 to Agent 2, their total value becomes 84 + 73 = 157.

Giving item 2 to Agent 2 seems the most balanced option, as Agent 0 has already received a highly valued item.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

This allocation minimizes envy and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
