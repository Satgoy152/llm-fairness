Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  89   1  75
1  60  95  66  21
2  95  70  86  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's consider the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [4, 89, 1, 75]
- Agent 1: [60, 95, 66, 21]
- Agent 2: [95, 70, 86, 36]

One potential approach is to try to maximize the total value for each agent while minimizing envy among them. Here's one possible allocation that achieves this:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0. This item is highly valued by Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1. This item is highly valued by Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2. This item is highly valued by Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1. This adds value to Agent 1 without creating envy, as it is not highly valued by others.

The allocations can be represented as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

Let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation considers the valuations and aims to distribute the items in a way that is as envy-free as possible.
