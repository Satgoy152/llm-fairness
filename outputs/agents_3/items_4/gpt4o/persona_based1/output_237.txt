Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  72  10  50
1  47   8  45  42
2  56  48  27  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve envy-free and fair division in this allocation problem, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" or "maximin" method, which aims to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their utility given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 50

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 42

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 52

To ensure a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. **First Round of Bids:** Each agent bids for their most valued item.
   - Agent 0 bids on Item 0 (value 89).
   - Agent 1 bids on Item 2 (value 45).
   - Agent 2 bids on Item 3 (value 52).

2. **Allocate Items:** Check if there are any conflicts.
   - No conflicts occur in this round, so allocate:
     - Agent 0 gets Item 0.
     - Agent 1 gets Item 2.
     - Agent 2 gets Item 3.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - The remaining item is Item 1.

4. **Second Round of Bids:** Agents bid for the remaining item.
   - Agent 0 bids on Item 1 (value 72).
   - Agent 1 bids on Item 1 (value 8).
   - Agent 2 bids on Item 1 (value 48).

5. **Allocate Remaining Item:** 
   - Agent 0 wins the bid for Item 1 as it is their highest remaining value.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the most valued items available to them at each step, minimizing envy and maintaining fairness within the constraints of the problem.

The allocations in JSON format are:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
