Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  90  33  31
1  60  12  10  37
2  19  28  96  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free division as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [82, 90, 33, 31]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [60, 12, 10, 37]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [19, 28, 96, 19]

To find a fair allocation, we should try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (90).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (60).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (96).

Based on these highest values, we can allocate:

1. Item 1 to Agent 0
2. Item 0 to Agent 1
3. Item 2 to Agent 2

We still have item 3 left, which has relatively low valuations across all agents. We should allocate this item to the agent who would derive the most incremental value from it. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (37) compared to Agent 0 (31) and Agent 2 (19).

Thus, item 3 should go to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they highly value, minimizing envy among them. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
