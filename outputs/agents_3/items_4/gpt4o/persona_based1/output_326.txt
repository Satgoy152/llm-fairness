Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  46  82  49
1  12  67  56  23
2  66  56  99  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total welfare or aiming for envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by any other agent over their own allocation.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [39, 46, 82, 49]
- **Agent 1**: [12, 67, 56, 23]
- **Agent 2**: [66, 56, 99, 78]

### Steps to Allocate:
1. **Determine the Most Valued Item for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (82).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (67).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (99).

2. **Identify Initial Fair Allocation:**
   - Since items cannot be split, we should try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized based on their individual preferences, while maintaining fairness.

3. **Find a Balanced Allocation:**
   - We need to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation. Given the constraints, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate items fairly.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Receives item 3 (value 49)
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 1 (value 67)
- **Agent 2**: Receives items 0 and 2 (values 66 and 99)

This allocation aims to minimize envy, considering the highest valuation each agent has for remaining items after initial preferences are set.

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 3, which they value reasonably high.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, their highest-valued item.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2, which together give them the maximum total value they can receive.

This setup aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints and ensures all items are allocated.
