Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  17  20  39
1  54  75  42  50
2  40  42  30  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that they have received the best or equal allocation compared to others based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 39

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 50

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 97

To create an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that they perceive their allocation as at least as valuable as any other allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81). 
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (75).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (42).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (97).

### Initial Allocation (based on highest valuations):

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3.

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (81) compared to any other item allocation.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2, which together provide a valuation of 117, which is higher than any single item.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3, which is valued highest by them at 97.

This allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
