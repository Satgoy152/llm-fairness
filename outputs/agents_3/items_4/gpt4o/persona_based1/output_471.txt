Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  14  27  35
1  87  27  84   6
2  61   5  70   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we must ensure that the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over those of the others based on their valuations.

Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 14, 27, 35]
- Agent 1: [87, 27, 84, 6]
- Agent 2: [61, 5, 70, 0]

A common approach for this type of problem is to use an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure, the envy-free algorithm for indivisible goods, or a heuristic approach to balance the allocations as fairly as possible. Given the small scale of the problem, a heuristic or a manual allocation based on the highest valuations can be executed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Adjust to meet the constraints of the problem while trying to maintain fairness.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. For Agent 0, the highest value is for item 3 (35).
2. For Agent 1, the highest value is for item 0 (87).
3. For Agent 2, the highest value is for item 2 (70).

This leaves item 1 unallocated. To determine which agent should receive item 1, we can check who values it the most:

- Agent 0 values it at 14.
- Agent 1 values it at 27.
- Agent 2 values it at 5.

Agent 1 values item 1 the most. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations for the unallocated item.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
