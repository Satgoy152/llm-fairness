Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  40  87  83
1  25  67  79  77
2  35  20  16  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents while taking into account their individual valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One possible approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, which means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [61, 40, 87, 83]
- Agent 1: [25, 67, 79, 77]
- Agent 2: [35, 20, 16, 53]

We need to allocate 4 items among 3 agents. A straightforward approach would be to allocate items such that each agent gets the item they value the most, while ensuring everyone gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 4.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 (87) the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (79), but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 1 (67).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (53) the most.

2. **Allocate these preferred items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets item 3.

3. **Allocate the remaining item (item 0):**
   - Item 0 has the following valuations: 61 (Agent 0), 25 (Agent 1), 35 (Agent 2).
   - The highest unallocated valuation is by Agent 0 (61) for item 0.

So, we assign item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [3]

This allocation is fair because:

- Agent 0 receives the items they value the most (87 and 61).
- Agent 1 receives their next highest valued item (67).
- Agent 2 receives their highest valued item (53).

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
