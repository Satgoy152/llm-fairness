Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  90  22  17
1  75  78  83  44
2  98  36  40  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In fair division with the objective of achieving envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent values their allocated bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. Given the provided valuations for each agent and each item, we need to allocate all 4 items among the 3 agents such that no agent envies another.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 77, Item 1 = 90, Item 2 = 22, Item 3 = 17.
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 75, Item 1 = 78, Item 2 = 83, Item 3 = 44.
- Agent 2 values items as follows: Item 0 = 98, Item 1 = 36, Item 2 = 40, Item 3 = 66.

To make a fair allocation, we can proceed by looking at the highest value items for each agent and trying to allocate them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** most values Item 1 (90).
2. **Agent 1** most values Item 2 (83).
3. **Agent 2** most values Item 0 (98).

Given these preferences, an initial allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 0

Now, we still have Item 3 remaining to be allocated. Let's consider the best placement for this item:

- Agent 0 values Item 3 at 17.
- Agent 1 values Item 3 at 44.
- Agent 2 values Item 3 at 66.

Since Agent 2 values Item 3 the most, we can allocate it to Agent 2.

The allocation then becomes:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 3

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 has a bundle valued at 90.
- Agent 1 has a bundle valued at 83.
- Agent 2 has a bundle valued at 98 + 66 = 164.

This allocation avoids envy because each agent receives an item they highly value, and no agent can claim that another has a better bundle based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
