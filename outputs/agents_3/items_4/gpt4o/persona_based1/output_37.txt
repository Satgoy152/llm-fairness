Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  55  72  47
1   7  91  31  21
2  88   0  79   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that they are receiving a fair share based on their own valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: 94 (Item 0), 55 (Item 1), 72 (Item 2), 47 (Item 3)
- Agent 1 values: 7 (Item 0), 91 (Item 1), 31 (Item 2), 21 (Item 3)
- Agent 2 values: 88 (Item 0), 0 (Item 1), 79 (Item 2), 8 (Item 3)

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 0 (Highest Valuation)**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 2 at 88, and Agent 1 at 7.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for it.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 91, Agent 0 at 55, and Agent 2 at 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation for it.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it at 79, Agent 0 at 72, and Agent 1 at 31.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 as they have the highest valuation for it.

4. **Item 3 (Handle remaining allocation)**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 21, Agent 2 at 8.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation remaining.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2

These allocations ensure that each agent receives the items that maximize their valuation, leading to a fair distribution based on the given preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
