Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  59  56  18
1  11   5  45   9
2  53  97  47  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [53 97 47 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [64, 59, 56, 18]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [11, 5, 45, 9]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [53, 97, 47, 28]

To achieve a fair allocation, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation. 

One possible fair allocation is:
1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 64)
2. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 45)
3. Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3 (values 97 and 28)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total value of 64
- Agent 1 a total value of 45
- Agent 2 a total value of 125

This allocation is reasonable because:
- Agent 0 gets their most valued item.
- Agent 1 also gets their most valued item.
- Agent 2 gets the highest total value, but they also have the highest individual item valuation for item 1 and a relatively high value for item 3, which they receive.

Thus, the allocation in the required format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
