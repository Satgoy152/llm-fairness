Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  28  95  24
1  22   1  44  26
2  80  19  59  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering the principle of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Given the agents' valuations for the items:

- Agent 0 values: [22, 28, 95, 24]
- Agent 1 values: [22, 1, 44, 26]
- Agent 2 values: [80, 19, 59, 26]

A fair allocation aims to minimize envy, where an agent should not prefer the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

One approach is to maximize the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring that each agent feels they received a fair share. By examining the values, we'll allocate items in such a way that each agent receives the items they value most highly.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (95).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (26).
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (80).

This preliminary allocation leaves item 1, which has the least value to all agents, unallocated. To complete the allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets item 1, as it is their second-highest value item after item 2.

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, which helps in minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a set of items, and we have allocated all 4 items.
