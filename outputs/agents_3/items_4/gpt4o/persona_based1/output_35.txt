Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  30   5  49
1   4  16  86  64
2  47  75  49  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, let's use each agent's valuation to guide the allocation process. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as being at least as valuable as those of other agents.

### Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: [96, 30, 5, 49]
- Agent 1: [4, 16, 86, 64]
- Agent 2: [47, 75, 49, 74]

### Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation First**: Allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent. This helps ensure each agent is satisfied with at least one high-value item.
2. **Balance and Envy Reduction**: Attempt to balance allocations such that agents feel their allocation is fair compared to others.

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Allocate Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 96, which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Allocate Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 86, which is the highest remaining valuation. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Allocate Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 at 75, which is the highest remaining valuation. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Allocate Item 3**: 
   - Remaining item 3 is valued at 49 by Agent 0, 64 by Agent 1, and 74 by Agent 2. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2, as this keeps the total perceived value highest for them and minimizes envy.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by allocating each agent their highest valued item, where feasible, and aiming for a balanced perceived value across agents.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
