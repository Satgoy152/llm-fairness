Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  71  55  22
1  49  56  31  75
2  10  42  58  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can aim to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  26  71  55  22
1  49  56  31  75
2  10  42  58  67
```

Our goal is to allocate these items in a way that satisfies as much of the envy-freeness criteria as possible. Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations on items 0 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation on item 3 and item 2.

A strategy is to allocate items in a way that minimizes the maximum envy, i.e., no agent should envy another agent's allocation more than they value their own allocation.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 71)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 49)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 75)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 58)

Here's the reasoning:
- Agent 0 gets item 1, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 2 gets item 2, which they value reasonably well and prevents excess envy.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and minimize potential envy among the agents.
