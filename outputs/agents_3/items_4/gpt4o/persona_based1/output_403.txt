Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  33   8  45
1  18  59  65  73
2  18  59  77  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that achieves envy-freeness or minimizes envy as much as possible. The matrix of valuations for the agents is as follows:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3
0 [25, 33,  8, 45]
1 [18, 59, 65, 73]
2 [18, 59, 77, 94]
```

We need to allocate the 4 items to the 3 agents so that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 3 the highest (45), so we can assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (65), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (59), but since Agent 1 values this item the same, we can assign item 1 to Agent 2, which leaves item 0 as a somewhat equal choice.
4. **Agent 1** is left with item 0, which is the remaining item.

Thus, the allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the agents' preferences.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents with consideration to their preferences to the extent possible.
