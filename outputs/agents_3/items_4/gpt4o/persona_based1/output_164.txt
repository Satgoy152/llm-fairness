Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  13  37  99
1  21  18  23   9
2  37  15  49  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 13 37 99]
 [21 18 23  9]
 [37 15 49 77]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness in this scenario, we need to allocate the items in a way that each agent is as satisfied as possible, considering their valuations. We want to ensure that no agent feels that another agent has received a more valuable bundle of items than their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [95, 13, 37, 99]
- Agent 1: [21, 18, 23, 9]
- Agent 2: [37, 15, 49, 77]

We can use the following strategy to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (99)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (23)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (77), but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is Item 2 (49), but it is taken by Agent 1. Next is Item 0 (37).

2. **Allocate the items based on the highest available value:**
   - Give Agent 0 the item they value the highest that is still available, which is Item 3.
   - Give Agent 1 the item they value the highest, which has not been claimed by Agent 0, which is Item 2.
   - Give Agent 2 the item they value the highest, which is available, which is Item 0.

3. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is Item 1. We can give this to Agent 1, as it is their second highest valued item.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives one of their top-valued items, and no agent can claim another agent's bundle is more valuable than their own considering the remaining options.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
