Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  40  88  84
1  25  66  40  28
2  40  23  72  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents so that the allocation is as fair as possible, we will aim to create an envy-free division where each agent values their allocated items as highly as possible. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as good as the bundles of others given their own valuation.

Let's consider the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 22     | 40     | 88     | 84     |
| 1     | 25     | 66     | 40     | 28     |
| 2     | 40     | 23     | 72     | 50     |

We'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, and ensure the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 2 (88) and Item 3 (84). Among these, the highest is Item 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 1 (66).
3. **Agent 2** highly values Item 0 (40) and Item 2 (72). Since Item 2 is already highly valued by Agent 0, we can allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Following this reasoning, let's make an allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now Item 3 remains unallocated. Among the agents, both Agents 0 and 2 have high valuations for Item 3, but Agent 0 values Item 3 more (84 versus 50 for Agent 2), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while distributing the items fairly. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
