Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  97   3  91  57
1  26  53  86   5
2  64   5  59  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider each agent's value for each item and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [97, 3, 91, 57]
- Agent 1: [26, 53, 86, 5]
- Agent 2: [64, 5, 59, 56]

Let's try to allocate items with the goal of minimizing envy:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 97. Assigning it to Agent 0 would likely maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 86. Assigning it to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.

3. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 56. Assigning it to Agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction with the items available.

4. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest among the remaining options, and it adds to their allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are distributed among the agents.
