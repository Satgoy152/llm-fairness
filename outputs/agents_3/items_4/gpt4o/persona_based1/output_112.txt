Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  53   3   0
1  59  66  41  78
2  42  48  68  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we will use each agent's valuation of the items to guide the allocation. The goal is to minimize envy among the agents, such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's an overview of the valuations by agents:

- Agent 0: Values items as [50, 53, 3, 0]
- Agent 1: Values items as [59, 66, 41, 78]
- Agent 2: Values items as [42, 48, 68, 32]

We will try to allocate the items to maximize the perceived value each agent receives, while ensuring that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1**: They place the highest value (78) on item 3, significantly higher than any other agent values it. We allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2**: Item 2 is most valuable to Agent 2 (value of 68), and Agent 2 values it more than any other agent. We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0**: Item 1 has the highest relative value to Agent 0 (53), and Agent 0 values it more than any other available item. We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Remaining Item**: Item 0 remains. Agent 1 values it the most (59). Since Agent 1 already has item 3, which they value highly, assigning item 0 to Agent 0, who also values it well (50), is reasonable, as Agent 0 doesnâ€™t have any highly valued items yet.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy.
