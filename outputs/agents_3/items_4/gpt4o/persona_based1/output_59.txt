Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  90   0  66
1  54  18  17  91
2  43  67  33  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free and efficient allocation. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own given their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 52 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 1) + 0 (Item 2) + 66 (Item 3) = 208
- Agent 1: 54 (Item 0) + 18 (Item 1) + 17 (Item 2) + 91 (Item 3) = 180
- Agent 2: 43 (Item 0) + 67 (Item 1) + 33 (Item 2) + 41 (Item 3) = 184

Now, let's look at each item and determine which agent values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 54 (highest)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 90 (highest)
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 33 (highest)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 91 (highest)

Using this information, we can propose the following allocation:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation)
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation)
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly, which can help reduce envy.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition of each agent getting an integer number of items and ensures that all 4 items are allocated.
