Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  24  81  41
1  57  80  35  90
2  62  90  72  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, it's useful to consider both fairness and efficiency principles such as envy-freeness and maximizing total valuation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can allocate the items:

### Step 1: Analyze Total Valuations
First, we calculate the total valuation of each item by all agents:
- Item 0: 18 + 57 + 62 = 137
- Item 1: 24 + 80 + 90 = 194
- Item 2: 81 + 35 + 72 = 188
- Item 3: 41 + 90 + 76 = 207

### Step 2: Consider Assignments
One approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining an envy-free allocation as much as possible. We will try to give each agent one highly valued item based on their individual valuations. 

### Step 3: Initial Allocation
Let's allocate the items:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest value item: Item 2 (81)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest value item: Item 3 (90)
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest value item: Item 1 (90)

These allocations leave us with Item 0.

### Step 4: Allocate Remaining Item
Now, we need to allocate Item 0:
- Agent 2 has the highest value for Item 0, compared to their valuation for the other items, so we assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation
The final allocation that aims to be envy-free and maximizes individual satisfaction is:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]

### JSON Format
Finally, we present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and every item is allocated.
