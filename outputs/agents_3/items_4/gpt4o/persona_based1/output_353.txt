Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  14  13  55
1  35  91  33  32
2  49  91  70  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This becomes challenging when we must assign all items to the agents such that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [53, 14, 13, 55]
- Agent 1's valuations: [35, 91, 33, 32]
- Agent 2's valuations: [49, 91, 70, 50]

One approach to achieve fairness is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the minimum value each agent receives or minimizes the maximum envy among agents. Given these valuations, we can consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This is Agent 1's highest valued item.
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: This is Agent 0's highest valued item.
3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**: While item 1 is also highly valued by Agent 2, it is already allocated to Agent 1. Item 2 is the next highest valued item for Agent 2.
4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: This item is Agent 0's next highest valued item and Agent 1's lowest valued item.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences to the extent possible:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3 with a total value of 108.
- Agent 1 receives item 1 with a total value of 91.
- Agent 2 receives item 2 with a total value of 70.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their highest or next highest valued items, minimizing envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
