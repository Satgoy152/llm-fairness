Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  29  51  89  70
1  20  63  59  10
2  20  69  14  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we aim to minimize envy by considering the valuations of each agent for the items. One common approach is to use envy-free algorithms or procedures that ensure each agent receives a bundle that they value at least as much as the bundles received by others, where possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [29, 51, 89, 70]
Agent 1: [20, 63, 59, 10]
Agent 2: [20, 69, 14, 77]
```

We'll try to find an allocation such that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive, given the constraints:

1. Each agent must receive an integer number of items.
2. All items must be allocated.
3. Minimize envy as much as possible.

One potential allocation is as follows:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (89), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (63), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (77), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. The remaining item 0 is valued equally by agents 1 and 2, but since Agent 2 has the next highest valuation (20 for item 0), we assign item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receiving item 2.
- Agent 1 receiving item 1.
- Agent 2 receiving items 0 and 3.

This allocation is likely to minimize envy, given the individual valuations. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
