Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  15  99  82
1  42  26  31  18
2  62  74  30  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. The goal is to distribute the four items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their share, given their valuations.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [40, 15, 99, 82]
- Agent 1 values: [42, 26, 31, 18]
- Agent 2 values: [62, 74, 30, 29]

We'll aim for an allocation that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their item valuations. 

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (99) and item 3 (82). To make Agent 0 satisfied, we should aim to give them one of these high-value items.
2. **Agent 1** has no extremely high valuations compared to the others, but item 1 (26) is the most valuable to them among their options.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (74) and item 0 (62). Since Agent 2 values item 1 the most among all agents, giving them this item might be the best choice.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 99) to Agent 0. This is the highest value item for any agent, making Agent 0 quite satisfied.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 18) to Agent 1. While not their highest, this allows them to have at least one item and keeps envy low since they don't have extremely high valuations.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (value 74) to Agent 2, as they value it the most compared to others.
- The remaining item 0 (value 62) can be assigned to Agent 2 to further satisfy them since it is also highly valued by them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation provides a distribution where agents are satisfied with their high-value items, minimizing potential envy among them.
