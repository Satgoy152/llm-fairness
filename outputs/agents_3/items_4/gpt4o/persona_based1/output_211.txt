Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  80  50  16
1   6  19   8  86
2  94  40  98  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will try to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 80
  - Item 2: 50
  - Item 3: 16

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 86

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 12

First, let's try to allocate the highest valued items to each agent:

- Agent 0's highest value item is Item 1 (80).
- Agent 1's highest value item is Item 3 (86).
- Agent 2's highest value item is Item 2 (98).

Now, we have already allocated Items 1, 2, and 3. Item 0 remains unallocated, and we need to decide which agent should get it:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 at 26.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 at 6.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 at 94.

Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest, so we can allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
