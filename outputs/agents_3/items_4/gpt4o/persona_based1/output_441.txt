Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  73  91  55
1  55  36  82   2
2  19  21  87   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can apply a simple approach given the small number of agents and items. The goal is to minimize envy, where each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations.

Firstly, let's consider the problem:

Agent valuations for items:
- Agent 0 values: [82, 73, 91, 55]
- Agent 1 values: [55, 36, 82, 2]
- Agent 2 values: [19, 21, 87, 0]

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations in a way that each agent ends up with an item they value highly.

Let's consider the highest valuations for each item:
- Item 0: Agent 0 (82)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (73)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (87)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (55)

Now, let's try to distribute these items by taking turns starting with the agent who has the highest valuation for any item:
1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 has already received an item, so we give the next preference).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values this item higher than Agent 1 and Agent 2).

This gives us the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1
- Agent 2 receives items: 2

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and it minimizes envy given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
