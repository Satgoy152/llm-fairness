Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  87  50  44
1   4  17  90  13
2   6  73  68  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and strive for an allocation that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation ensures no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Here's the table for reference:

```
       Items
      0   1   2   3
0  96  87  50  44
1   4  17  90  13
2   6  73  68  54
```

Let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values item 0 the most (96), followed by item 1 (87).
   - To maximize their satisfaction, item 0 should be allocated to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values item 2 the most (90).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values item 1 the most (73), followed by item 2 (68).
   - Since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining item:**
   - Item 3 is left unallocated.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 44, Agent 1 at 13, and Agent 2 at 54.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, who values it higher than the others.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 3

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
