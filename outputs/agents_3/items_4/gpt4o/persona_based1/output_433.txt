Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  10  73  14
1  42  92  57   3
2  41  34  11  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider a method that provides an envy-free solution or at least minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 11, Item 1 = 10, Item 2 = 73, Item 3 = 14
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 42, Item 1 = 92, Item 2 = 57, Item 3 = 3
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 41, Item 1 = 34, Item 2 = 11, Item 3 = 55

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method like the "round-robin" procedure, where agents take turns picking their most valued item. However, we must ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. 

One possible envy-free allocation is:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (73).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value for Agent 1 (92).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2. This item has the highest value for Agent 2 (55).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1. This item has the second-highest value for Agent 1 (42).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and it minimizes the potential for envy because each agent receives at least one of their most valued items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
