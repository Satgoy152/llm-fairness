Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  87  74  16
1  91  70  49  88
2  78  79  76  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

To achieve this, let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [42, 87, 74, 16]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [91, 70, 49, 88]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [78, 79, 76, 46]

Let's try to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle that they value highly, while minimizing envy:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the most (87).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (91).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the most (76).

Based on these preferences, a possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have one item left (item 3). We should assign it in such a way that minimizes envy:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the least (16).
- Agent 1 values item 3 second (88).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the least (46).

Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it provides the highest additional value without causing much envy.

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the agents' preferences and minimizes potential envy.
