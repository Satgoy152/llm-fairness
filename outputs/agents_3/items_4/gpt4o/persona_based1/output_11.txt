Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  63  51  36
1  65  89  75  64
2  71  58  80  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 89 75 64]
 [71 58 80 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible, where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own.

Let's consider the valuation table:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3
0  19  63  51  36
1  65  89  75  64
2  71  58  80  92
```

We need to allocate the 4 items to 3 agents. A potential way to achieve a fair allocation is to consider the highest valuations first and then balance the overall allocations so that no agent feels envious.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 92. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
   
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 89. Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 80. However, since Agent 2 already has an item, we can give item 2 to agent 1 who values it at 75.

4. **Item 0**: Finally, agent 1 values item 0 the most at 65, but agent 0 values it at 19, and since agent 0 has no items, assign item 0 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

This allocation ensures all agents receive items, and the distribution reflects their preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
