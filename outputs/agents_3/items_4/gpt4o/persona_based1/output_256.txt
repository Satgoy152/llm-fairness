Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  31  93  70
1  93  11  99   4
2   8  42  51   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider an approach that minimizes envy and attempts to achieve a fair distribution of the perceived values. Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: [26, 31, 93, 70]
- Agent 1 values: [93, 11, 99, 4]
- Agent 2 values: [8, 42, 51, 0]

One approach is to use the Envy-Free algorithm, which attempts to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share compared to others. However, given the constraint to allocate exactly one item per agent and that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we'll aim for a simple fair allocation.

First, let's identify the most valued item for each agent:
- Agent 0's most valued item is Item 2 (value 93).
- Agent 1's most valued item is Item 2 (value 99) or Item 0 (value 93).
- Agent 2's most valued item is Item 2 (value 51).

Since Item 2 is most valuable to all agents, we need to distribute other items to balance perceived fairness. Let's allocate items considering the next best preferences:

1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, who values it the highest.
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, which is their second-highest valued item.
3. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2, which is their highest valued item remaining.
4. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it relatively highly compared to other options.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
