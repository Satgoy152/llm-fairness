Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  71  69  62
1  98  63  58  90
2  50  81  98  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation with the given valuations, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair allocation based on their personal valuations. A simple and effective approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and identify the best allocation for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 69
  - Item 3: 62
  - Total value for all items: 77 + 71 + 69 + 62 = 279

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 90
  - Total value for all items: 98 + 63 + 58 + 90 = 309

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 51
  - Total value for all items: 50 + 81 + 98 + 51 = 280

Now, we can proceed to allocate the items to the agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction and ensures fairness:

1. **Allocate Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest at 98.
   
2. **Allocate Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values Item 2 the highest at 98.

3. **Allocate Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest at 81.

4. **Allocate Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest at 62.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that envy is minimized. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be envy-free as much as possible given the constraints.
