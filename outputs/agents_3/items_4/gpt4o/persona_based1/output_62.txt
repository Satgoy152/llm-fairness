Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  19  57  61
1  98  76  34  27
2  31  94  77  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that tries to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (57) followed by item 3 (61).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (98) followed by item 1 (76).
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (94) followed by item 2 (77).

Considering these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows to minimize envy and distribute the items fairly:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value for item 3 after agent 1 who already received item 0).

This allocation attempts to give each agent a set of items that they value highly, attempting to reduce envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the integer nature of the item allocations, ensures all items are allocated, and attempts to minimize envy among the agents given their valuations.
