Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  30  66  91
1  31  45  27  14
2  88   2  76  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 45 27 14]
 [88  2 76 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: values items [0, 1, 2, 3] as [49, 30, 66, 91]
- Agent 1: values items [0, 1, 2, 3] as [31, 45, 27, 14]
- Agent 2: values items [0, 1, 2, 3] as [88, 2, 76, 24]

An initial approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one of their most valued items.

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 88), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 91), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 0** also has a high valuation for item 2 (value 66), and Agent 2 values it at 76, but Agent 1 values it only at 27. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2 to balance their allocations since they have one item so far.
4. Finally, for item 1, **Agent 1** has the highest valuation (value 45), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, letâ€™s verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3 with a value of 91.
- Agent 1 receives item 1 with a value of 45.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2 with values of 88 and 76 respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and minimizes envy since each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
