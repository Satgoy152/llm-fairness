Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  78  93  17
1  84  52   3  84
2  78  59  17  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own based on their valuations. Given the valuations provided, we can approach this by maximizing each agent's satisfaction as much as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 93, followed by item 1 at 78, and item 0 at 77. However, we need to consider the allocations for the other agents as well to maintain fairness.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 84, and item 3 the same at 84. Item 1 is valued at 52, and item 2 is valued the least at 3.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 81, followed by item 0 at 78, item 1 at 59, and item 2 at 17.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, consider the following distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receiving item 2, which they value at 93, avoiding envy as this is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 receiving item 0, which they value at 84, avoiding envy as this is their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, valued at 59 and 81, respectively, which are collectively high-valued items for them compared to what they could receive otherwise.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly four.
