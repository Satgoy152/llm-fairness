Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  41  37  36
1   4  44  96  78
2  91  37  81  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of any other agent. An envy-free allocation is often difficult to achieve perfectly, but we can aim for a distribution that minimizes envy.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [86, 41, 37, 36]
- Agent 1: [4, 44, 96, 78]
- Agent 2: [91, 37, 81, 40]

Let's approach this problem step by step:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 86.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 96.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 91.

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it's their highest valued item and no other agent values it as highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but Agent 0 also values it highly. However, Agent 2 values it slightly higher, so we can initially consider giving item 0 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Now we have items 1 and 3 left. Agent 0's second highest valued item is 1 at 41, and Agent 1 values item 3 at 78 (highest remaining value for them).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Review and finalize allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
   - Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent gets at least one of their more preferred items, and the distribution attempts to balance the overall perceived value.

**Final Allocation in JSON:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, respects individual preferences as much as possible, and distributes all 4 items.
