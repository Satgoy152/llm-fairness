Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  98   7  70
1  84  86  84  21
2  60   3  27  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method such as maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing envy. Here, we'll attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [43, 98, 7, 70]
- Agent 1: [84, 86, 84, 21]
- Agent 2: [60, 3, 27, 83]

One possible allocation strategy is to assign the items such that each agent gets the item they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate each item for allocation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43
   - Agent 1 values it at 84
   - Agent 2 values it at 60
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7
   - Agent 1 values it at 84
   - Agent 2 values it at 27
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 70
   - Agent 1 values it at 21
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

With this allocation, we try to ensure that each agent gets as much value as possible from the items they value highly. This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0 and Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
