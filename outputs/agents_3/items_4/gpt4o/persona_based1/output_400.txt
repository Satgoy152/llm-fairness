Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  98   0  65  99
1   6  86  41  85
2  75   8  31   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 0 and 3. 
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 2.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1** gets item 1.
- **Agent 2** gets item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, given that we have to assign all items. This assignment appears envy-free as each agent receives the items they value the highest among the remaining options.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
