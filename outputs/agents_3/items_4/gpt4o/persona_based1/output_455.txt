Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  63  25  73
1  77  10  64   0
2   2  94  84   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 10 64  0]

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. An envy-free allocation is not always possible, but we can aim for a fair division that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: [96, 63, 25, 73]
- Agent 1 values items: [77, 10, 64, 0]
- Agent 2 values items: [2, 94, 84, 1]

A reasonable approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. Item 0 has the following valuations: [96, 77, 2]
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 96.

2. Item 1 has the following valuations: [63, 10, 94]
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 94.

3. Item 2 has the following valuations: [25, 64, 84]
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 84.

4. Item 3 has the following valuations: [73, 0, 1]
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 73.

With this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation respects the constraint of allocating all 4 items and gives each item to the agent who values it the most. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
