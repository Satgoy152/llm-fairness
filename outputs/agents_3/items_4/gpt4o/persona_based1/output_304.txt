Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  76  99  68
1  90   6   5  31
2  35  23  89  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should envy another based on their valuations of the items they receive. One possible approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "adjusted winner" procedure or a similar heuristic that balances the total value derived by each agent.

Here is a proposed allocation that aims for fairness and minimizes envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for all items, but particularly values item 2 highly. Therefore, to maximize their satisfaction, we can give them item 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly, so it is reasonable to assign item 0 to them.
3. **Agent 2** also values item 2 highly, but since agent 0 receives item 2, we can give agent 2 items 1 and 3. This allocation gives agent 2 two items, which compensates for not receiving the highest-valued item (item 2).

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their personal valuations:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (value = 99).
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (value = 90).
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3 (value = 23 + 18 = 41).

This distribution respects the integer allocation constraint and aims to maintain fairness by considering the individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
