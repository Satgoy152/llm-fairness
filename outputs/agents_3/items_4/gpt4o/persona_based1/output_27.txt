Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  46  65  77
1  32  78  39  12
2  48  32  27  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring no envy among the agents. We'll aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [94, 46, 65, 77]
- Agent 1 values: [32, 78, 39, 12]
- Agent 2 values: [48, 32, 27, 48]

A possible fair allocation strategy is to assign each agent one item they value highly and allocate the remaining item to minimize envy. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it's their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it's their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it is tied for their highest valued item but choosing this item helps balance the remaining allocation.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 to maximize their total value and minimize envy.

Checking the total valuations with this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2: 94 + 65 = 159
- Agent 1 receives item 1: 78
- Agent 2 receives item 3: 48

This allocation attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints, with Agent 0 getting two items to balance the overall value distribution.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
