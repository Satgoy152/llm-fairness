Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1  2   3
0  90  41  3  41
1  57  95  2  19
2  44   9  7  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible, taking into account each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 90).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 95).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (value 77).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuation:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2 is left unallocated. Its valuations are: Agent 0 (3), Agent 1 (2), Agent 2 (7).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it the most among the agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, and the remaining item is allocated based on the highest relative value.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
