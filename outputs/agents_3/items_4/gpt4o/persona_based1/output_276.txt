Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  94   8  28  63
1   7  17  91  70
2  31  82  36  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 17 91 70]
 [31 82 36 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that tries to ensure some level of fairness, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives (a max-min fair allocation). 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [94, 8, 28, 63]
- Agent 1 values: [7, 17, 91, 70]
- Agent 2 values: [31, 82, 36, 48]

First, identify the item each agent values the most:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (94).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (82).

We can use these choices as a starting point to ensure that each gets at least their highest-valued item. However, this would leave item 3 unallocated. We need to find a balanced allocation.

A possible allocation that tries to maximize fairness could be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Item 3 can be assigned to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high value for it (70), and this allocation allows Agent 1 to have a fair share in terms of value.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to balance the distribution based on their valuations.
