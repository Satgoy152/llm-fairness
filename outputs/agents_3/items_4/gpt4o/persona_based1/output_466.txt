Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  19  47  81
1  40  39  43   6
2  82   9  47  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and ensure each agent gets at least one item. We will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 and item 3 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly, but since Agent 0 also values it highly, we should consider alternative allocations.

Let's try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 3 (values: 85 and 81)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value: 43)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value: 9)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Total value = 85 + 81 = 166
- Agent 1: Total value = 43
- Agent 2: Total value = 9

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed, while attempting to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.
