Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0   9   9  98  77
1  98  10  53  17
2  22  55  97  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. Given the constraints of distributing 4 items among the 3 agents, I'll attempt to ensure that each agent receives at least one item that they highly value, if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 98, followed by item 3 at 77.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 98.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 97, but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 1 at 55.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Allocation:**
   - Item 3 is remaining. Agent 0 values item 3 at 77, Agent 1 at 17, and Agent 2 at 14. Given Agent 0's relatively high valuation compared to the others, allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
