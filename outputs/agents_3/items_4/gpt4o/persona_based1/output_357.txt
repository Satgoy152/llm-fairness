Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  85  84  29
1  45  86  71  58
2  65  81  53  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 86 71 58]
 [65 81 53 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [71, 85, 84, 29]
- Agent 1 values: [45, 86, 71, 58]
- Agent 2 values: [65, 81, 53, 11]

To find an allocation that minimizes envy:

1. **Item 1 (Index 1)** has the highest value for Agent 1 (86), so we allocate it to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0 (Index 0)** is valued highly by both Agent 0 (71) and Agent 2 (65), slightly more by Agent 0. To balance the remaining allocations and because Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2 (Index 2)** is valued the highest by Agent 0 (84), followed by Agent 1 (71). Since Agent 0 already received Item 0, and to balance the total value for each agent, we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3 (Index 3)** is valued highest by Agent 1 (58), followed by Agent 0 (29). However, since Agent 1 already has Item 1, we allocate Item 3 to Agent 2, who values it at 11, to ensure all agents receive items.

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent receives and minimizes envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
