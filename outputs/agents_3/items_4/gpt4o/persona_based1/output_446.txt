Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  26  29  90
1  82  45  65  89
2  79  35  40  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives at least as much value from their allocation as they would from any other allocation. In this scenario, we have three agents and four items. Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

The values each agent assigns to each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: [10, 26, 29, 90]
- Agent 1: [82, 45, 65, 89]
- Agent 2: [79, 35, 40, 29]

A possible approach to achieving an envy-free allocation is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. One possible allocation is:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1
3. Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 2

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Value of item 3 = 90
- Agent 1: Value of item 0 = 82
- Agent 2: Values of items 1 and 2 = 35 + 40 = 75

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 receives item 3, which has a higher value than any other single item.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, which is the highest value item for them.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2, which together provide a higher combined value than any other single item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
