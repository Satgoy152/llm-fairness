Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  10  80  75
1  71  88  70  39
2  14  11  49  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 88 70 39]
 [14 11 49 78]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim for an envy-free division, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We can achieve this by considering the preferences and values each agent assigns to the items.

Let's first list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 75, Item 1 = 10, Item 2 = 80, Item 3 = 75
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 71, Item 1 = 88, Item 2 = 70, Item 3 = 39
- Agent 2: Item 0 = 14, Item 1 = 11, Item 2 = 49, Item 3 = 78

Using these valuations, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle they value highly, and no agent envies another's allocation.

A fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2. This is the highest value item for Agent 0 (value = 80).
- Agent 1 receives Item 1. This is the highest value item for Agent 1 (value = 88).
- Agent 2 receives Item 3. This is the highest value item for Agent 2 (value = 78).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item, Item 0:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 at 75.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 at 71.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 at 14.

Since Agent 0 values Item 0 the most, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

Therefore, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.

This allocation respects the agents' preferences and aims to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
