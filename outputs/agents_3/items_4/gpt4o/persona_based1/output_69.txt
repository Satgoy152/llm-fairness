Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  56   2  77   6
1   6  57  40   9
2   3  33  63  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that no agent feels that another agent received a more valuable bundle according to their own valuations. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [56, 2, 77, 6]
Agent 1: [6, 57, 40, 9]
Agent 2: [3, 33, 63, 70]
```

We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 4 items are allocated. One potential way to allocate items is to consider each agentâ€™s highest valued item and attempt to allocate it to them if it doesn't conflict with the needs of other agents.

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Item 2 (valued highest by Agent 0):** Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (77). No other agent values item 2 as their highest priority, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1 (valued highest by Agent 1):** Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (57). No other agent values item 1 as their highest, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3 (valued highest by Agent 2):** Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (70). No other agent values item 3 as their highest, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0:** Now, we need to allocate item 0. It is most valuable to Agent 0 (56), but Agent 0 already has item 2, which is more valuable for them. Comparing the remaining allocations, it's sensible to allocate item 0 to Agent 1 as it adds to their bundle without creating envy, given Agent 1 has a lower value for item 0 compared to item 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility given their individual valuations, minimizing envy across agents. Below is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
