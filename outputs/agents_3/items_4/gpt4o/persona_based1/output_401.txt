Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  11   6  36
1  90  88  25  99
2  41  40  90  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on the given valuations. One approach to achieve this is to look for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Given the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [57, 11, 6, 36]
Agent 1: [90, 88, 25, 99]
Agent 2: [41, 40, 90, 83]
```

Let's analyze the allocations:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (90) and item 3 (99). Allocating these items to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (90). Allocating item 2 to Agent 2 would maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 0** can then take item 1, which they value at 11. Although this is the lowest-valued item for Agent 0, it is the remaining item.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the most valuable items according to each agent's preferences are allocated to them, minimizing envy.

The allocations can be presented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the conditions: each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution minimizes potential envy based on the given valuations.
