Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  26  67   9
1  82  89  73   2
2  10  26  82  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. Let's consider the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   14   |   26   |   67   |    9   |
|   1   |   82   |   89   |   73   |    2   |
|   2   |   10   |   26   |   82   |   10   |

One possible approach is to allocate items in a way that each agent receives the items they value most. We can use a greedy algorithm to assign the highest-valued items to each agent sequentially:

1. Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (value 89), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Next, Agent 2 values Item 2 the most (value 82), so assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 values Item 2 the most, but since it's already taken, their next highest valuation is Item 0 (value 14), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. The remaining item is Item 3, which has low valuations across the board. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as they have the least number of items.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value significantly while minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
