Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  51  83  80
1  55  55  16  28
2  71  62  37  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We'll try to find an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy by distributing the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 at 73, 1 at 51, 2 at 83, 3 at 80
- Agent 1 values items: 0 at 55, 1 at 55, 2 at 16, 3 at 28
- Agent 2 values items: 0 at 71, 1 at 62, 2 at 37, 3 at 93

One approach to achieve fairness is using the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion. This means that each agent should not envy another agent's allocation more than the value of a single item.

Let's consider an allocation that aims to minimize envy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (83).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (93).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they also value it highly (73) and it complements their allocation.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is equally valued by them (55), and they receive an item with good relative value.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 gets item [1]
- Agent 2 gets item [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value reasonably well, and no agent envies another agentâ€™s allocation more than the value of one item.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
