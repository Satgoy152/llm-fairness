Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  24  11  87
1  39  18  91  22
2  41  85  59  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we can apply the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own. 

Given the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [24, 24, 11, 87]
- Agent 1: [39, 18, 91, 22]
- Agent 2: [41, 85, 59, 72]

We need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

To achieve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign the highest-valued item to the agent who values it the most, provided that it doesn't cause other agents to have a significantly higher total value.

2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while balancing the overall satisfaction.

Let's go through the items and assign them:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest at 41.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest at 85.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 91.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 87.

Now, let's see if this allocation creates any envy:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 with a value of 87.
- Agent 1 gets item 2 with a value of 91.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1 with a total value of 126 (41 + 85).

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 values their item at 87 and doesnâ€™t envy other agents because their highest-valued item is what they received.
- Agent 1 has their highest-valued item, item 2, and is satisfied.
- Agent 2 has a total valuation of 126, the highest among all, and received the two items they value most.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
