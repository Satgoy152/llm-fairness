Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  36  67  12
1  80   2  86  77
2  94   4  28  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible given the valuations. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. The challenge here is to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [70, 36, 67, 12]
- Agent 1: [80, 2, 86, 77]
- Agent 2: [94, 4, 28, 80]

A straightforward way to approach this is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for a respective item. Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 94), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 86), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 80), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (value 36), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, we are trying to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 3.

This allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
