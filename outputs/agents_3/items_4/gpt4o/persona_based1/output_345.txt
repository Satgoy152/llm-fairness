Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  15  90  85
1  87  13  26  81
2  90  79  87  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent believes their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 15
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 85

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 81

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 10

A potential allocation method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it does not create an unbalanced distribution of items among agents. Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest (90), so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest (79), but Agent 2 already has Item 0. We need to distribute items more evenly, so consider assigning Item 1 to Agent 0, who values it at 15.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest (90), so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest (85), but Agent 0 already has two items (1 and 2). Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the next highest, so assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

This distribution aims to reduce envy and ensures that each agent has some items based on their preferences. Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
