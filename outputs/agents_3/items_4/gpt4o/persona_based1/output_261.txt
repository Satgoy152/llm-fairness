Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  19  70  61
1  33  93  94  44
2  44  64  28  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 93 94 44]
 [44 64 28 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. One common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness is not always possible, we can try to minimize envy.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  72  19  70  61
1  33  93  94  44
2  44  64  28  94
```

To find a reasonable allocation, we can use a simple heuristic method. We will allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1:** Has the highest value for item 2 (94). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2:** Has the highest value for item 3 (94). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0:** From the remaining items (0 and 1), Agent 0 values item 0 the most (72). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

Now we have one item left, item 1, which has relatively low values compared to others. We should allocate it to the agent who would least envy another agent's allocation by receiving this item.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:** Already has item 0. Adding item 1 (value of 19) is reasonable since it improves their overall satisfaction without significantly increasing envy from other agents.
   - **Agent 1:** Already has item 2.
   - **Agent 2:** Already has item 3.

### Final Allocation:

Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations and minimize overall envy.
