Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  77   3  79
1  68  63  52  44
2  91  62  78  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to distribute the items such that envy is minimized, or ideally, eliminated. In this context, envy-free means that each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's first consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 values: 34 (item 0) + 77 (item 1) + 3 (item 2) + 79 (item 3) = 193
- Agent 1 values: 68 (item 0) + 63 (item 1) + 52 (item 2) + 44 (item 3) = 227
- Agent 2 values: 91 (item 0) + 62 (item 1) + 78 (item 2) + 19 (item 3) = 250

Next, assess the most valued items for each agent to ensure they receive a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest (78).

Given these preferences, we can begin by assigning each agent their highest valued item, ensuring no overlap:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, only item 1 remains to be allocated. We will assign it to the agent who benefits the most from it without creating significant envy:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 77.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 63.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 62.

Agent 0 values item 1 the highest. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
