Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  81  58  11
1  47  68  54  64
2  54  15  91  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle given their valuations.

Let's first consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [76, 81, 58, 11]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [47, 68, 54, 64]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [54, 15, 91, 69]

A common method to achieve fairness is to ensure each agent receives the item(s) they value most. Here is one possible allocation that seeks to minimize envy:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1, as it is their highest valued item at 81.
2. Agent 1 gets item 3, as it is their highest valued item at 64.
3. Agent 2 gets item 2, as it is their highest valued item at 91.

Now we need to allocate the remaining item, item 0. To maintain balance and minimize envy, we can give this item to Agent 0, as they value it the highest compared to the other agents.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, and no agent envies the allocation of another, given they are receiving their respective highest-valued item(s).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
