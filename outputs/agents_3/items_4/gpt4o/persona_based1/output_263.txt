Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  30  86  65
1  76  34  83  74
2  48  29  92  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation. One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least minimize envy, is to allocate the items such that each agent receives the items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 37, Item 1 = 30, Item 2 = 86, Item 3 = 65
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 76, Item 1 = 34, Item 2 = 83, Item 3 = 74
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 = 48, Item 1 = 29, Item 2 = 92, Item 3 = 37

To determine a fair allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Each agent receives the item they value the most, if possible, without overlap.
2. If two agents value the same item the most, allocate it to the agent who values it more or try to balance the allocations based on the remaining items.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

### Allocation Process:

- **Item 2** is valued the highest by Agent 2 (92) and is also highly valued by Agent 0 (86) and Agent 1 (83). Let's assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 0** is most highly valued by Agent 1 (76). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3** is valued highly by Agent 1 (74) and Agent 0 (65). Since Agent 1 already has Item 0, let's assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** is the least valued, but assigning it to Agent 0 will balance the allocation, as Agent 2 has the highest value item and Agent 1 has Item 0.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the items are distributed in a way that minimizes envy among the agents.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
