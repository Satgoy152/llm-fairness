Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  21  86  22
1  19   5  97  49
2  23   5  41  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19  5 97 49]
 [23  5 41 31]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of items among the three agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value from their allocated items. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, given their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [96, 21, 86, 22]
- Agent 1 values items as: [19, 5, 97, 49]
- Agent 2 values items as: [23, 5, 41, 31]

A potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, which helps to ensure that at least locally, each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96 (highest value).
   
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21 (highest value).
   
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it at 97 (highest value).
   
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it at 49 (highest value).

After assigning these items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 does not get any items, as they do not have the highest valuation for any item.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, thus minimizing potential envy and maximizing individual satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
