Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  52  44  17
1  62  53  92  62
2   8  98  39  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem, we must allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. This condition is known as envy-freeness. Given that there are more agents than items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging, but we can aim for a division that minimizes envy and tries to distribute items fairly according to agent valuations.

Let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 79, 52, 44, 17
- Agent 1 values items: 62, 53, 92, 62
- Agent 2 values items: 8, 98, 39, 75

To minimize envy, we need to allocate items by considering the maximum value each agent assigns to each item. We'll try to allocate items to the agents who value them the most:

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (value = 79)
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (value = 98)
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (value = 92)
4. Item 3: Next highest value by Agent 2 (value = 75), as Agent 2 highly values item 1 and item 3.

Based on this approach, a fair division is:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation attempts to give each agent one of the items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
