Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  57   9   6
1  35  30  56  80
2  87  43  70  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 57  9  6]
 [35 30 56 80]
 [87 43 70 51]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [51, 57, 9, 6]
- Agent 1 values: [35, 30, 56, 80]
- Agent 2 values: [87, 43, 70, 51]

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 57).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 80).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 87).

3. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 2 is left. Agent 2 values it at 70, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (9) and Agent 1's valuation (56).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation should be reasonable and envy-free based on the given valuations, as each agent receives an item they value highly and are not envious of the allocations to other agents. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
