Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  58  25  79
1  53  31  71  67
2  51  97  64  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to assign items such that each agent feels that they have received an allocation at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 79)
   - Next highest value item: Item 1 (value 58)
   - Third highest value item: Item 2 (value 25)
   - Lowest value item: Item 0 (value 9)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 71)
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value 67)
   - Third highest value item: Item 0 (value 53)
   - Lowest value item: Item 1 (value 31)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 97)
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value 80)
   - Third highest value item: Item 0 (value 51)
   - Lowest value item: Item 2 (value 64)

Considering these preferences, here's a proposed allocation:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2. This is Agent 2's most valued item.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0. This is Agent 0's most valued item.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1. This is Agent 1's most valued item.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1. This item is not the most valuable to Agent 1, but it provides a balanced distribution, and Agent 1 still receives a high valuation overall.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they highly value, minimizing envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their own allocation.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
