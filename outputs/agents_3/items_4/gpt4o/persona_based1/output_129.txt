Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  57  33  17
1  83  18  44  57
2  41  76  30  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we aim to satisfy the condition of envy-freeness to the extent possible, given discrete allocations. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations. We will consider the valuations provided for each item to make a decision.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [51, 57, 33, 17]
- **Agent 1**: [83, 18, 44, 57]
- **Agent 2**: [41, 76, 30, 24]

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 83, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 76, so we allocate it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 44, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 17, and since Agent 1 and Agent 2 have received higher valued items already, we allocate it to Agent 0.

### Allocation Result:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation aims to reduce envy among agents by giving each a share of items they value highly. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
