Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  16  39  33
1  30  85  57   2
2  13  50  52  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate these items fairly among the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's first evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all the items to get a sense of their preferences:

- Agent 0 values: 40 + 16 + 39 + 33 = 128
- Agent 1 values: 30 + 85 + 57 + 2 = 174
- Agent 2 values: 13 + 50 + 52 + 22 = 137

Now, let's consider allocating the items:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 85, which is significantly higher than the other agents, so it makes sense to allocate this to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (40), so it would be fair to allocate this item to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item at 57, the highest, but since Agent 1 already has item 1, we should try to balance the allocations. Agent 2 values it at 52, which is also high, so we'll allocate it to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 33, which is higher than the other agents' valuations. Since Agent 0 has only received one item so far, it's reasonable to allocate this item to Agent 0.

The allocations are now as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation gives us the following values:

- Agent 0: 40 + 33 = 73
- Agent 1: 85
- Agent 2: 52

This allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints and attempts to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
