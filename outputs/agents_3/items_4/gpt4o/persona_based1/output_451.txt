Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  41  33  14  76
1  42  65  10  95
2   9  16  50  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the four items among the three agents and ensure an envy-free or nearly envy-free distribution, we can use a valuation-based approach. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while trying to minimize envy.

Here's a step-by-step method to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item Across All Agents:**
   - Item 0: 41 (Agent 0) + 42 (Agent 1) + 9 (Agent 2) = 92
   - Item 1: 33 (Agent 0) + 65 (Agent 1) + 16 (Agent 2) = 114
   - Item 2: 14 (Agent 0) + 10 (Agent 1) + 50 (Agent 2) = 74
   - Item 3: 76 (Agent 0) + 95 (Agent 1) + 91 (Agent 2) = 262

2. **Allocate Items Based on Agent Preferences:**
   - To minimize envy, we should try to allocate items such that each agent gets their most valued items.

3. **Assignment:**
   - **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - For the remaining item (item 0), compare the remaining values:  
     - Agent 0: 41  
     - Agent 1: 42  
     - Agent 2: 9  
     Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most among unallocated items.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
   - Agent 2: Item 2

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, leading to a fair distribution with minimal envy.
