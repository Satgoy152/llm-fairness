Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  96   0  87   5
1  14  21  22  81
2  68  18  63  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to any other agent over their own bundle.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: 96, 0, 87, 5
- Agent 1 values items as: 14, 21, 22, 81
- Agent 2 values items as: 68, 18, 63, 45

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (96), so allocating item 0 to Agent 0 is optimal.
2. **Item 1**: Since Agent 0 values item 1 as 0, they will not want it. Agent 1 values item 1 at 21, and Agent 2 values it at 18. Therefore, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 87, which is the highest valuation for this item. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 at 81, which is the highest valuation. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Resulting Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 2: No items

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their own bundle, based on their valuations, given the constraint of integer allocations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
