Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  26  29  27
1  77  37   6  76
2  37  39  65  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, one approach is to maximize the minimum valuation that each agent receives. We need to allocate the 4 items to the 3 agents such that each agent's perceived value of their allocated items is as balanced as possible. 

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [11, 26, 29, 27]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [77, 37, 6, 76]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [37, 39, 65, 46]

A potential method to allocate the items is by using the "maximum product of utilities" method or ensuring that each agent gets an item that they value highly, thus minimizing envy. 

Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it is the most valued by agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it is the most valued by agent 1.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it is the second-highest value for agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as it provides a balanced distribution and agent 2 values it second highest.

With this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, valued at 29.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, valued at 77.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, valued at 39 and 46 respectively, totaling 85.

This allocation ensures that each agent perceives a fair share according to their valuations, and by distributing the items in this manner, we minimize envy as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
