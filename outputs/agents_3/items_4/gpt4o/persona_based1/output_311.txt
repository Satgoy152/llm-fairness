Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  66  94  33
1  64   2  71  64
2  14  40  35  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations presented by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations more closely:

```
Agent 0: [47, 66, 94, 33]
Agent 1: [64, 2, 71, 64]
Agent 2: [14, 40, 35, 34]
```

A common method to achieve a fair division is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives (also known as the maximin strategy). Another strategy is to ensure that no agent would prefer to swap their allocation with another agent's allocation, which is a form of envy-freeness.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (94), 1 (66)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (64), 3 (64), 2 (71)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (40), 3 (34)
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and aims to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their most valued items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the item they value the most (item 2), Agent 1 one of the items they highly value (item 0), and Agent 2 the remaining items, which are their next best options. This distribution should help achieve a fair division based on the given valuations.
