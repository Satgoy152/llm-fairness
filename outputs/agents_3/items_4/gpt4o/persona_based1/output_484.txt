Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  77  74  12
1  87  54  55  32
2  58  67  87  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total perceived value for each agent. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 49     | 77     | 74     | 12     |
| 1     | 87     | 54     | 55     | 32     |
| 2     | 58     | 67     | 87     | 86     |

We need to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. One approach is to use the maximum valuations each agent has for the items.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 1 (77).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 0 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 2 (87).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item. The remaining item is item 3, which has the following valuations:

- Agent 0: 12
- Agent 1: 32
- Agent 2: 86

Agent 2 values item 3 the most, so it makes sense to allocate it to them.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their perceived values. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, reducing potential envy among them.
