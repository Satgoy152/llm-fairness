Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  41  15  49
1  36  56  20  29
2  78  28  49  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness among the agents, we can use various fair division algorithms. One common approach is to aim for a proportional or envy-free allocation where each agent should feel that the bundle they receive is at least as valuable as any other bundle, given their own valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [34, 41, 15, 49]
Agent 1: [36, 56, 20, 29]
Agent 2: [78, 28, 49, 22]
```

We'll aim to allocate the items in a way that balances their perceived value to each agent:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (49).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (56).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (78).

Based on these highest valuations, we can start by allocating these items to each agent:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

This leaves item 2 unallocated. We should consider which agent would benefit most from item 2, in a way that doesn't cause envy:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 15.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 20.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 49.

Since Agent 2 values item 2 significantly higher than the others, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]

This allocation is fair because:

- Agent 0 receives their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 receives their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 receives their highest valued item and another item they value the most among the remaining.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
