Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  40  48  35
1  42  84  55  87
2  34   8  87  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 84 55 87]
 [34  8 87 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible within these constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [76, 40, 48, 35]
- Agent 1 values: [42, 84, 55, 87]
- Agent 2 values: [34, 8, 87, 27]

A common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items while balancing envy.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

The reasoning is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0, which they value the highest (76).
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3, which they value highly (84 and 87).
- Agent 2 gets item 2, which they value the highest (87).

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest or second-highest valued item(s).

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 4, meeting the constraints of the problem.
