Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  37  93  96
1  51  49  56  11
2  18  69  73  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of another agent over their own allocation. In this problem, we want to allocate 4 items among 3 agents based on their valuations.

Let's calculate possible allocations and determine an envy-free distribution.

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0:** 79, 37, 93, 96
- **Agent 1:** 51, 49, 56, 11
- **Agent 2:** 18, 69, 73, 51

### Steps to Allocate:
1. **Agent 0** values Item 3 the most (96), followed by Item 2 (93).
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the most (56), but Agent 0 values it higher.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 1 the most (69).

To ensure fairness and reduce envy:

- **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0** since it is highly valued by them compared to others.
- **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0** because it is the next highest valuation after Item 3.
- **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2** since it's their highest-valued and Agent 0 already has items.
- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1** since it's their highest valued item available after the allocations above and Agent 0 already has a higher valued allocation.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 1.

This way, each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, ensuring an envy-free distribution as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
