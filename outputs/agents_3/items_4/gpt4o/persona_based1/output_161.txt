Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  76   1  14
1  15  92  50  44
2  98  70  94  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has a better deal, given their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 15, Agent 2 at 98.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 92, Agent 2 at 70.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 50, Agent 2 at 94.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 44, Agent 2 at 74.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation**:
   - **Item 0**: The highest value is by Agent 2 at 98. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1**: The highest value is by Agent 1 at 92. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 2**: The highest value is by Agent 2 at 94. However, since Agent 2 already has Item 0, consider the next highest value, which is by Agent 1 at 50. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 3**: The highest value is by Agent 2 at 74. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Verify allocations**:
   - Agent 0: No items allocated.
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 2 allocated.
   - Agent 2: Items 0 and 3 allocated.

By following these steps, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation helps ensure that each agent receives items they highly value, attempting to minimize envy among the agents.
