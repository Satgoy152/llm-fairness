Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  19  95  65
1  32  77  71  85
2  11  22  26  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. We aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items to maximize each agentâ€™s total value while considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 65

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 85

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 81

To minimize envy and ensure fairness, we should try to allocate items where each agent has a relatively high valuation compared to the others. Here is a possible allocation:

- Give item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it at 95, which is the highest valuation among all items for Agent 0.
- Give item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it at 81, which is the highest valuation among all items for Agent 2.
- Give item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it at 77, which is the second-highest valuation for Agent 1, but ensures Agent 1 receives a high-value item.
- Give item 0 to Agent 1 as well, since Agent 1 values it at 32, which complements their allocation and is better than allocating it to the others based on remaining items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
