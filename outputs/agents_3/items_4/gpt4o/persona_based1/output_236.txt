Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  74  36  40
1  57  32  97   7
2  63  57  96  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness to the extent possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they think they could achieve if they had the choice. Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 40

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 7

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 50

A simple approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. An allocation that respects these considerations is:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their most valued item.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their most valued item among the remaining items.
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it quite highly and it complements their allocation.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 3.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
