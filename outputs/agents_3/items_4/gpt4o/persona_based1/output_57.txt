Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  18   7  14
1  55  91  67  91
2   8  67  42  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 18  7 14]
 [55 91 67 91]
 [ 8 67 42 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that could be envy-free or at least minimize envy where possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation, according to their valuations.

Given the valuations:
```
Agent 0: [85, 18, 7, 14]
Agent 1: [55, 91, 67, 91]
Agent 2: [8, 67, 42, 39]
```

Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: This is a highly valued item for Agent 0 with a valuation of 85, which is the highest among all valuations for item 0.
2. **Assign item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 91, which is the maximum value for this item.
3. **Assign item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 42, which is the highest valuation for this item.
4. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 91, which is the maximum value for this item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items by assigning them items they value highly.

The allocation can be summarized in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a share of the total available value based on their preferences, aiming to reduce envy and improve fairness.
