Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  95  15  29
1  68  13  88  95
2  92   1  25  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's first consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [76, 95, 15, 29]
- Agent 1 values: [68, 13, 88, 95]
- Agent 2 values: [92, 1, 25, 85]

We can start by considering the items that have the highest valuations and allocate them to the respective agents:

1. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 2 (92).
2. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 0 (95).
3. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 1 (88).
4. **Item 3** is valued equally high by Agent 1 (95), slightly less by Agent 0 (29), and Agent 2 (85).

Here's a reasonable allocation approach:

- Allocate **Item 0** to Agent 2.
- Allocate **Item 1** to Agent 0.
- Allocate **Item 2** to Agent 1.
- Allocate **Item 3** to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 also values this item highly at 95, and it ensures Agent 1's overall allocation is fair).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives Item 0.

This setup ensures that each agent gets at least one of the items they value highly, maximizing individual satisfaction and envy-freeness. 

The resulting allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
