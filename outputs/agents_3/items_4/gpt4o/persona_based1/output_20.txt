Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  47  64  28
1   3  85  34  93
2  79  21   8  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they would get if they could trade with another agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's break down the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 28

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 93

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 48

We can achieve an envy-free allocation by considering the preferences of each agent and ensuring that no agent feels envious of another. 

One possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0:** Assign Item 0 (value 90 for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Assign Item 1 (value 85 for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** Assign Item 3 (value 48 for Agent 2)

Since we still have Item 2 left, we need to allocate it to an agent. Given that Agent 0 already has a high-value item and Agent 1 has a relatively high-value item compared to Agent 2, we will allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 to balance the total personal perceived value:

- **Agent 1:** Assign Item 2 (value 34 for Agent 1)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and tries to minimize envy among the agents based on their valuations.
