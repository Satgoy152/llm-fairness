Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  58  66   3
1  39   1   2  12
2  61  83  71  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a manner that is fair and attempts to minimize envy, we will use a simple approach by analyzing the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the table of valuations again for quick reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 83     | 58     | 66     | 3      |
| 1     | 39     | 1      | 2      | 12     |
| 2     | 61     | 83     | 71     | 58     |

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values this the highest (83), followed by Agent 2 (61). Agent 1 values it at 39. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values this the highest (83), followed by Agent 0 (58). Agent 1 values it the least (1).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values this the highest (66), followed by Agent 2 (71). Agent 1 values it the least (2).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values this the highest (58), followed by Agent 1 (12). Agent 0 values it the least (3).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

**Resulting Allocation:**

- Agent 0 is allocated item 0.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 is allocated items 1, 2, and 3.

This allocation is designed to maximize the total happiness based on the valuations provided, with attempts to minimize envy by giving the items to the agents who value them the most.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
