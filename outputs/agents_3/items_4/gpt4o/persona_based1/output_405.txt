Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  11  20   0
1  42   6  18   3
2  29  22  40  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible. A common fairness criterion is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items is not always possible, so we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [90, 11, 20, 0]
- Agent 1 values items as: [42, 6, 18, 3]
- Agent 2 values items as: [29, 22, 40, 47]

We'll start by examining the highest valuations each agent has and attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued item:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (90).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (42), but since Agent 0 values it more, we consider their second highest, item 2 (18).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (47).

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - The remaining items are 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 18, which is their highest available preference.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 11, which is their second highest preference.

Thus, the allocation that minimizes envy while ensuring that each item is allocated is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's share based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations

{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
