Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  83  87  26
1  17  78  95  18
2  92  97  92  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution if possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agents\Items | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
-------------|---|---|---|---
Agent 0      |32 |83 |87 |26
Agent 1      |17 |78 |95 |18
Agent 2      |92 |97 |92 |68
```

We will first consider each agent's preferences:

- **Agent 0** values the items as follows: 2 (87), 1 (83), 0 (32), 3 (26).
- **Agent 1** values the items as follows: 2 (95), 1 (78), 3 (18), 0 (17).
- **Agent 2** values the items as follows: 1 (97), 0 (92), 2 (92), 3 (68).

To find a fair allocation, we will attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them high-valued items according to their preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (95).

2. **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (97).

3. **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among the remaining items after items 1 and 2 are allocated (32).

4. **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0:
   - Item 3 is leftover, and Agent 0 is the only one left with an allocation that can be increased without causing envy (Agent 0 values it at 26).

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is relatively balanced in terms of envy-freeness based on the agents' preferences. 

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
