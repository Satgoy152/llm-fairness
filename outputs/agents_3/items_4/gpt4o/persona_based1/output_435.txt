Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  87  87  16
1  36  20  27  57
2   8  27  90  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, let's first consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [66, 87, 87, 16]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [36, 20, 27, 57]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [8, 27, 90, 81]

One approach to ensure fairness and reduce envy is to maximize the total perceived value for each agent by considering the items they value most. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to balance these valuations:

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 90.
2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 87.
3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 57.
4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 66, which is the second-highest value for them.

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, thus minimizing envy. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all four items and takes into account the highest preferences for each agent, attempting to balance the distribution of perceived value.
