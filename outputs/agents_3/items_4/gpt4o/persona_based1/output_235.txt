Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  97  94  38
1  18  63  40  10
2  35  37  61  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, let's consider the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while also ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible given discrete allocations. Here, we aim for an allocation where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 36 | 97 | 94 | 38 |
| 1          | 18 | 63 | 40 | 10 |
| 2          | 35 | 37 | 61 | 37 |

Let's go through the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 and item 2 the highest (97 and 94, respectively). Allocating them both these items maximizes their value and reduces potential envy from other agents wanting these highly-valued items.

2. **Agent 1**: After item 1 and item 2 are allocated to Agent 0, the next highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 (value of 18). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The remaining item is item 3, which Agent 2 values as 37. This is a reasonable allocation for Agent 2 given that their highest left-over value is for item 3.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2]
- Agent 1 receives item [0]
- Agent 2 receives item [3]

This allocation maximizes the total satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an item and attempting to minimize envy.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
