Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  75  68  37
1  86  50  66  63
2  10  70  67   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free as much as possible, given that each agent has different valuations for each item. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values:  
  - Item 0: 4  
  - Item 1: 75  
  - Item 2: 68  
  - Item 3: 37  

- **Agent 1** values:  
  - Item 0: 86  
  - Item 1: 50  
  - Item 2: 66  
  - Item 3: 63  

- **Agent 2** values:  
  - Item 0: 10  
  - Item 1: 70  
  - Item 2: 67  
  - Item 3: 0  

We'll pursue an allocation approach where each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and we try to minimize envy by considering their highest-valued items first.

1. **Allocate Item 0**:  
   - Agent 1 values this the most at 86. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 75. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 68, but Agent 2 values it at 67, which is close. To ensure fairness, let's assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate Item 3**:  
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 63, but Agent 2 values it at 0 and Agent 0 at 37. Since Agent 1 already has a high-value item (Item 0), assign Item 3 to Agent 0, who has Item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one high-value item, and the allocation is reasonably fair based on their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
