Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  74   5  58
1  38  21  62   3
2  87  63  93   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The objective is to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their own valuations.

Here is a strategy that attempts to achieve fairness:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0's highest value is for item 1 (74).
   - Agent 1's highest value is for item 2 (62).
   - Agent 2's highest value is for item 2 (93), but since agent 1 also highly values item 2, we need to find a compromise.

2. **Allocate based on highest valuations while considering envy-freeness**:
   - Give item 1 to agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
   - Give item 2 to agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.
   - Now, consider agent 2's next highest valued item, which is item 0 (87).
   - Give item 0 to agent 2.
   - We have one item left, item 3, which hasn't been allocated yet. It should go to the agent who values it more and can balance the overall fairness. Agent 0 values item 3 at 58, while agent 1 and 2 value it at 3 and 5 respectively. Thus, allocate item 3 to agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
