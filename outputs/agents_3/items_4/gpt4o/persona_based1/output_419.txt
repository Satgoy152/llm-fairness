Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  32   0  71
1  66   0  35   4
2   6  65  55  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of any other agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's break down the problem:

- **Agent 0** values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 71

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 4

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 52

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to give each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (71) and item 0 (36). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (66). Since item 3 is already given to agent 0, let's allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (65) and item 2 (55). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 2.

Now we have:
- Agent 0 with item 3
- Agent 1 with item 0
- Agent 2 with item 1

The remaining item is item 2. Let's allocate it to agent 2, as they value it at 55, which is higher than any other agent's valuation of the remaining item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: items 1 and 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most from the available options, creating an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
