Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  40  52  14
1  15  70  13  53
2  59  66  55  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and try to minimize envy among the agents. An allocation is envy-free if no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [45, 40, 52, 14]
- Agent 1 values items as: [15, 70, 13, 53]
- Agent 2 values items as: [59, 66, 55, 48]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to allocate items in such a way that each agent values their received bundle at least as much as the bundles of other agents, as per their respective valuations.

### Allocation Plan

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 52). Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 ensures they receive a highly valued item.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 70). Allocating item 1 to them ensures they receive a highly valued item.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 59). Allocating item 0 to them ensures they receive a highly valued item.

4. **Remaining Items**: Item 3 is left unallocated. We need to assign it in such a way to maintain a balance in perceived fairness. Item 3 has a relatively high value for Agent 1 at 53. Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 might maintain the perceived fairness.

### Final Allocation

Here's the allocation based on the analysis above:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent has a high-value item according to their own preferences, and Agent 1 gets two items due to their higher valuation of the unallocated item.

### Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation should minimize envy, given the valuations provided, and ensures that all items are allocated.
