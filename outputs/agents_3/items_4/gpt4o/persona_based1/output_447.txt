Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  90  81  51
1  37   0   5  26
2  70  67  77  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received the most valuable set of items, given the distribution to others.

The agents' valuations for the items are:

- Agent 0: [5, 90, 81, 51]
- Agent 1: [37, 0, 5, 26]
- Agent 2: [70, 67, 77, 83]

One approach is to allocate items such that each agent gets the item they value the most among the remaining unallocated items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (90).
2. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (83).
3. Agent 2's next highest valued item is item 2 (77) after item 3 is allocated.
4. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (37).

Let's assign the items based on these preferences:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is four.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
