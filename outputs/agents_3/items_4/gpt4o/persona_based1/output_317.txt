Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  25   0  57
1  53  83  98   1
2  45  44  45  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (57).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (45).

This leaves us with item 1. We check which agent would benefit most from item 1 without causing envy:

- If we give item 1 to Agent 0, their total valuation would be 25 (item 1) + 57 (item 3) = 82.
- If we give item 1 to Agent 1, their total valuation would be 83 (item 1) + 98 (item 2) = 181.
- If we give item 1 to Agent 2, their total valuation would be 44 (item 1) + 45 (item 0) = 89.

To minimize envy, we give item 1 to Agent 0, as it balances the distribution of value more evenly.

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives a bundle they value sufficiently, and this allocation attempts to minimize envy among the agents.
