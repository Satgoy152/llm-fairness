Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  68   9  77
1  62  82  45  28
2  58  66  88  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, which means each agent should prefer their own bundle of goods over others based on their valuations. We will use a method that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Valuations Table:
```
        Items
        0   1   2   3
Agents
0:     93  68   9  77
1:     62  82  45  28
2:     58  66  88  78
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest preference (value) for item 0 (93).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest preference (value) for item 1 (82).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest preference (value) for item 2 (88).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item (3)**:
   - Compare valuations for the remaining item (3):
     - Agent 0: 77
     - Agent 1: 28
     - Agent 2: 78

   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it slightly more (78) than Agent 0 (77).

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

The allocation is envy-free because each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
