Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  27   9  98  55
1  23  12  96  65
2  14  47  18  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. This means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 27, Item 1 = 9, Item 2 = 98, Item 3 = 55
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 23, Item 1 = 12, Item 2 = 96, Item 3 = 65
- Agent 2: Item 0 = 14, Item 1 = 47, Item 2 = 18, Item 3 = 59

A straightforward approach to ensure fairness is to try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while avoiding envy.

1. **Item 2** has very high valuations from both Agent 0 and Agent 1, but the highest value is 98 from Agent 0, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 at 65, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1** has the highest valuation from Agent 2 at 47, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0** can be allocated to the agent who has not received an item yet or to balance valuations. Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for Item 0 at 23, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

With this allocation, each agent receives items that they value, and the distribution of items is complete.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
