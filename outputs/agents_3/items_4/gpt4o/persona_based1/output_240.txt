Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  91  86  42
1  57  58  42  96
2  35  17  99  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach to achieve a fair division is to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent believes they receive a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 42

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 96

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 66

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle they perceive as fair based on their valuations.

One possible way to allocate the items to minimize envy and satisfy fairness is as follows:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value (91) for Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value (96) for Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2. This item has the highest value (99) for Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1. Although it's not the highest value for Agent 1, it gives the second-highest value after Item 3 and helps in balancing the allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one high-value item according to their preferences, and the distribution minimizes envy among the agents.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to minimize envy based on the agents' valuations.
