Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  37   6  95  92
1  23  97  37  17
2  96  67   9  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims to be fair and reduce envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. In this case, we will try to ensure each agent receives at least one item they highly value if possible, and distribute the remaining items to balance out the perceived value as evenly as possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (95) and item 3 (92) almost equally.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (96).

An allocation strategy that considers these preferences might be:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valuation.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valuation.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valuation.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valuation and helps balance the distribution of perceived value.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they value highly and minimizes envy by maximizing total perceived value for each agent. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and every item is allocated.
