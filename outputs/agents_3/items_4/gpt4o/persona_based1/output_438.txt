Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  55  46  18
1  73  55  56  47
2  16  47   5   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. Here is a suggested allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 0 highly (59), so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Values item 1 relatively highly as well (55).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has the highest valuation for item 1 (55), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Values item 2 highly (56).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has low valuations overall, but relatively values item 3 the highest (7).
   - Given the other allocations, item 3 is available, so it can be allocated to Agent 2.

Based on this, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 3

This allocation respects the integer constraint on the number of items per agent and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
