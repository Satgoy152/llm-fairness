Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  19  89  50
1  12  16  16  83
2  31  54  77  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that considers the preferences of the agents as expressed by their valuations. The goal is to distribute the four items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and, ideally, no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [44, 19, 89, 50]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [12, 16, 16, 83]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [31, 54, 77, 55]

We must allocate items such that each agent receives some value and the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

1. **Item 2**: This item has the highest total valuation among all agents, and agent 0 values it the most (89).
2. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item the most (83).
3. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item the most (54).
4. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item the second most (31) after item 1.

Based on these preferences, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Receives item 2, which they value the most.
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 3, which they value the most.
- **Agent 2**: Receives items 0 and 1, which they value second most and most respectively.

This allocation aims to minimize envy because each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
