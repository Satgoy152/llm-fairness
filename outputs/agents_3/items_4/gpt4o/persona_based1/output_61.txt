Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  73   8   1   3
1  51  35  19  16
2  19  61  25  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The objective is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they are receiving at least as much value as they would expect if they were to swap allocations with another agent.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [73, 8, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: [51, 35, 19, 16]
- Agent 2: [19, 61, 25, 53]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to maximize the perceived value each agent receives. One strategy is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, given that each agent should receive at least one item.

Let's analyze the allocation:

1. Item 0 (valued highest by Agent 0):
   - Agent 0: 73
   - Agent 1: 51
   - Agent 2: 19
   Allocate to Agent 0.

2. Item 1 (valued highest by Agent 2):
   - Agent 0: 8
   - Agent 1: 35
   - Agent 2: 61
   Allocate to Agent 2.

3. Item 2 (valued highest by Agent 1):
   - Agent 0: 1
   - Agent 1: 19
   - Agent 2: 25
   Allocate to Agent 2.

4. Item 3 (valued highest by Agent 2):
   - Agent 0: 3
   - Agent 1: 16
   - Agent 2: 53
   Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 does not receive any items.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 3.

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with Agent 2 receiving multiple items due to their higher valuation, and Agent 1 unfortunately receiving none due to their lower relative valuations on most items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
