Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  90  96  82
1  70  26  93  12
2   6  23  76  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, as much as possible, given each agent's valuations of the items.

Here are the steps we can follow:

1. **Identify Valuations**: Each agent has their own valuation of each item. The table provided gives us these valuations:

   - Agent 0: Item 0 (12), Item 1 (90), Item 2 (96), Item 3 (82)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (70), Item 1 (26), Item 2 (93), Item 3 (12)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (6), Item 1 (23), Item 2 (76), Item 3 (72)

2. **Initial Allocation**: To achieve a fair allocation, we should consider giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (96).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (93), but since it's highly valued by Agent 0, we look at Agent 1's next highest valuation, which is Item 0 (70).
   - Agent 2 values Item 2 the most (76), but this item is highly valued by Agent 0. The next highest valuation for Agent 2 is Item 3 (72).

Given these preferences and to ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can try the following allocation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (since they value it the highest).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (since Item 2 is already taken, and Item 0 is their next highest valuation).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (since Item 2 is taken, and Item 3 is their next highest valuation).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining Item 1, which hasn't been allocated yet:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 90, among the remaining items.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest remaining valuations while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item and all items are allocated.
