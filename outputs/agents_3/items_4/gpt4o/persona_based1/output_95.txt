Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  74   7  95  24
1  42  14  60  96
2  51  13  52  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 14 60 96]
 [51 13 52 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [74, 7, 95, 24]
- Agent 1 values items as: [42, 14, 60, 96]
- Agent 2 values items as: [51, 13, 52, 68]

One approach is to allocate items so that each agent receives items that maximize their personal valuation, ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of another. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate item 2** to Agent 0 because they value it the highest at 95.
2. **Allocate item 3** to Agent 1 because they value it the highest at 96.
3. **Allocate item 0** to Agent 2 because they value it at 51, compared to their other valuations and the remaining available items.
4. **Allocate item 1** to Agent 0 because it maximizes their remaining valuation after the previous allocations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is four.
