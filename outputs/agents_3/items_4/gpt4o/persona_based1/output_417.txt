Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  78  56  41
1  44  67  64  48
2   8  56  14  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's break down the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 41

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 67
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 48

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 14
  - Item 3: 18

A useful strategy is to attempt maximizing each agent's total value from their allocation, while ensuring no envy. We'll try to allocate items to the agents based on their highest value for those items, but ensuring overall balance and fairness.

1. **Agent 0** values Item 1 the highest (78).
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the highest (64).
3. **Agent 2** values Item 1 (56) and Item 3 (18) relatively higher than other items, but since Item 1 is already assigned to Agent 0, we need to find a suitable allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 2's valuation is very low for Item 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as it has relatively higher value for Agent 2 compared to other available items.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value relatively more and attempts to balance the total value among the agents.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
