Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  37  49  16
1  96  30  18  48
2  41  43  74  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them so that no agent envies another agent's share.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 15  
  - Item 1: 37  
  - Item 2: 49  
  - Item 3: 16  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 96  
  - Item 1: 30  
  - Item 2: 18  
  - Item 3: 48  

- Agent 2 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 41  
  - Item 1: 43  
  - Item 2: 74  
  - Item 3: 28  

A possible fair allocation is:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1. This is because Agent 1 values item 0 the highest.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2. This is because Agent 2 values item 1 the highest.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This is because Agent 0 values item 2 the highest.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. Agent 1 values item 3 higher than other unassigned items for other agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the allocation aims to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valued remaining item.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
