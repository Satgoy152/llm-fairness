Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  94  37  86
1  49  68  12  53
2  78  98  95  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims to minimize envy among agents, we should consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while ensuring each item is allocated.

### Valuations Table

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 92     | 94     | 37     | 86     |
| 1     | 49     | 68     | 12     | 53     |
| 2     | 78     | 98     | 95     | 46     |

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for Item 1 (94).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for Item 1 (68), but since Agent 0 already has a stronger claim to it, we consider the next highest, which is Item 3 (53).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for Item 1 (98), but since Agent 0 has the highest claim, we consider the next highest, which is Item 2 (95).

### Allocation Result

Given these considerations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1 (94).
- Agent 1 gets Item 3 (53).
- Agent 2 gets Item 2 (95).

Now, we need to allocate Item 0:

- Since Agent 0 has already received an item, compare the valuations for Agent 1 and Agent 2.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 49.

Thus, allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to consider the agents' highest preferences and distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy.
