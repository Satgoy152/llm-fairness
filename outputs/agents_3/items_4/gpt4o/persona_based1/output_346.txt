Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  70  15  76
1   5  77   8  47
2  39  50  87  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, given their valuations. We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 47

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 33

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can consider the following strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest value for the item, ensuring no agent envies another agent's allocation.

2. Start with the items that have the most significant disparity in valuation among agents to minimize potential envy.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 2 has the highest value (87) for Agent 2, and it is significantly higher than the others. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1 (77) and also by Agent 0 (70), but Agent 1 values it more. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (76). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Item 0 is relatively balanced, but it's most valuable to Agent 2 (39) compared to others. Since Agent 2 already has Item 2, and to avoid envy, assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, every agent has at least one item, and the allocation avoids envy based on the initial conditions.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the need for each agent to receive items and minimizes potential envy, given the valuations in the table.
