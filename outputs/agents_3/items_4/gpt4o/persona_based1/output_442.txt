Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  50  28  87
1  44  16  90  87
2  54  16  65   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to find a distribution where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items at [61, 50, 28, 87]
- Agent 1: Values items at [44, 16, 90, 87]
- Agent 2: Values items at [54, 16, 65, 3]

One key approach to achieving envy-freeness is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly relative to their individual valuations.

Let's evaluate a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (87)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (61)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (90)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (87)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (65)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (54)

From this, we can deduce a possible allocation by prioritizing the highest valued items for each agent:

- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 given its highest valuation and no conflict with Agent 1â€™s highest valued item.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2, which is their second highest valued item, but still valued highly by Agent 0.

This leaves Item 1, which has relatively low valuations across all agents, but Agent 0 values it higher than others.

Here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Item [2]
- **Agent 2**: Item [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly while minimizing envy between agents.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
