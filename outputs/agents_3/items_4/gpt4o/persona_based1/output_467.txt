Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  47  33  47
1  76  88  94  95
2  13  61  30   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive, considering their valuations. One approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" approach, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet received an item. We'll proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values: [45, 47, 33, 47]
   - Agent 1 values: [76, 88, 94, 95]
   - Agent 2 values: [13, 61, 30, 2]

2. **Item Allocation:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most at 76.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 88.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the most at 95.

However, this allocation gives all items to Agent 1, which isn't fair. We need to distribute them more evenly while keeping valuations in mind.

3. **Adjusted Allocation for Fairness:**
   - **Item 0:** Assign to Agent 1 (value 76).
   - **Item 1:** Assign to Agent 2 (value 61). This helps balance the allocation.
   - **Item 2:** Assign to Agent 0 (value 33). Though Agent 1 values it higher, this balances the allocation.
   - **Item 3:** Assign to Agent 1 (value 95). Agent 1 values it the most and already has item 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 1.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring a somewhat fair distribution of items.

{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
