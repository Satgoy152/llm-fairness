Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  77  70  83
1  47  14  67  72
2  37  39  58  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents while aiming to maintain envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0: 73 + 77 + 70 + 83 = 303
   - Agent 1: 47 + 14 + 67 + 72 = 200
   - Agent 2: 37 + 39 + 58 + 17 = 151

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:**
   - **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (83), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (67), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (58), but since it is already taken by Agent 1, we look at the next highest value item, which is item 1 (39), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 0** now has item 3. The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (73), which is not taken, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Review the allocations to ensure fairness and that all items are allocated:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 2
   - Item 2: Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, leading to a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
