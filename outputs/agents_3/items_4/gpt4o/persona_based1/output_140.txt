Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  23  92  60
1  36  38  91  88
2  24  62  13  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Analyze Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values: [86, 23, 92, 60]
   - Agent 1 values: [36, 38, 91, 88]
   - Agent 2 values: [24, 62, 13, 53]

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (86)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (62)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (92)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (88)

3. **Allocate Based on Fair Distribution:**
   - We aim to allocate items such that no agent is envious of another, or the envy is minimized.
   - To achieve this, and ensure every agent gets at least one item, we might manually adjust the allocation:

   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item they highly value, minimizing envy.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
