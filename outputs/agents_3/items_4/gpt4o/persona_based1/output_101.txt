Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  90  55  39
1  29  33  73  84
2  14  32   1  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to allocate items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. 

Let's examine the matrix of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  42  90  55  39
1  29  33  73  84
2  14  32   1  72
```

Our goal is to allocate all 4 items among the 3 agents. An envy-free allocation ensures each agent believes they received a fair share given their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 1 (value 90).
   - We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, Agent 1's highest remaining valuation is for item 3 (value 84).
   - We allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - After items 1 and 3 are allocated, Agent 2's highest remaining valuation is for item 3 (value 72), but it is already taken. The next highest for Agent 2 is item 1 (value 32), but it is also taken. Thus, we look at the remaining items: 0 and 2.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 14 and item 2 at 1. We allocate item 0 to Agent 2 as it has a higher valuation in comparison to item 2.

4. **Remaining Item**:
   - The only remaining item is 2, which none of the agents have a particularly high valuation for, but it must be allocated.
   - We look at the distribution to ensure balance: 
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has one item and Agent 2 has one item, while Agent 0 already has the item with the highest value for them.

### Final Allocation

Based on the above strategy, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3, 2]
- Agent 2: [0]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, minimizing envy and ensuring fairness as much as possible given the constraints.
