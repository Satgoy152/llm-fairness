Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  64  56  84
1  94  35  85  68
2  90  55  56  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or attempting to balance the perceived value each agent gets from the allocation. In this case, we will consider the agent's preference for each item and allocate items accordingly.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [32, 64, 56, 84]
Agent 1: [94, 35, 85, 68]
Agent 2: [90, 55, 56, 79]
```

To distribute the items, we will consider each agent's highest valued items and try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly if possible.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Allocate item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 94.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

2. **Allocate item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 84, followed by agent 2 at 79.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

3. **Allocate item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 85, followed by agent 0 at 56.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Allocate item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 64, followed by agent 2 at 55.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual preferences and minimizes envy to the extent possible with an integer allocation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent is considered in terms of their preferences. Agent 2, unfortunately, receives no items due to the constraints of integer allocation and the valuations provided.
