Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  35  61  97
1  92  52  55  60
2  40  88  29  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate items to agents in a way that is fair and envy-free as much as possible. With 3 agents and 4 items, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each. We aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations of the items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [46, 35, 61, 97]
- Agent 1: [92, 52, 55, 60]
- Agent 2: [40, 88, 29, 61]

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (97), so we can assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (92), so we can assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (88), so we can assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have one item left, item 2. We must assign this item to one of the agents. Let's evaluate:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 61.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 55.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 29.

Agent 0 values item 2 the most. Assigning item 2 to Agent 0 balances their satisfaction, as Agent 0 initially received the highest-value item.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [1]

Here is the JSON format of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
