Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  30  84   4
1  20  99  56  98
2  31  93  94  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [75, 30, 84, 4]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [20, 99, 56, 98]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [31, 93, 94, 57]

We need to allocate 4 items among the 3 agents. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (84).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (99) and item 3 (98).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (94) and item 1 (93).

2. **Potential Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (75).
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (99).
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (94).
   - Remaining item 3 needs to be allocated.

3. **Allocation of Remaining Item:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 98.
   - Since agent 1 also values item 3 highly, giving it to agent 1 would maximize their total value without creating envy from the others.

4. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3
   - Agent 2: Item 2

The allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives at least one item.
- Agent 1 receives two items since they have higher valuations for them, which reduces the potential envy from others.
- The allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
