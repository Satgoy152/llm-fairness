Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  96  39  31
1  34  77  96  23
2  32  66   4  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we can consider allocating items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here, we aim for a division that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 31

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 23

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 78

Given these valuations, we can attempt an allocation strategy as follows:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item the highest at 96.
2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values this item the highest at 78.
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item highly at 96.
4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 also values this item highly at 96, maintaining a high total valuation for Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they're relatively satisfied with, and it is as envy-free as possible under the circumstances.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
