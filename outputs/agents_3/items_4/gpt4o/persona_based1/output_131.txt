Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  20   0  93  47
1  18  12  83  33
2  36  57  10  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and no agent feels another received a bundle of higher value than what they received. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most (93). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: After removing item 2, Agent 1 values item 3 the most (33). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**: After removing items 2 and 3, Agent 2 values item 1 the most (57). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Unallocated Items**: Item 0 is left. We can check the remaining preferences to allocate it:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (20) compared to the other agents.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution aims to reduce envy by giving agents items they highly value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
