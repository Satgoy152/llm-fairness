Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  62  70  22
1  49  59  38  67
2  80  60  76  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 48     | 62     | 70     | 22     |
| 1     | 49     | 59     | 38     | 67     |
| 2     | 80     | 60     | 76     | 97     |

One common approach to achieve envy-freeness is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation, where each agent receives their highest-valued item available. However, with only four items and three agents, it may also be possible to use other criteria, like maximizing the minimum satisfaction.

Let's consider a strategy that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for every item. To avoid envy, we will first allocate an item with the highest value to **Agent 2**. In this case, Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

2. Next, we need to consider Agents 0 and 1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (70), and it hasn't been allocated yet, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

3. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3, but since it's already allocated, we look at the next highest available. Agent 1 values item 0 (49) the highest among the remaining items, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

4. Finally, item 1 is left unallocated. Agent 0 values item 1 the most among unallocated items (62), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation strategy attempts to satisfy each agent by giving them items they value highly, ensuring no agent feels significantly envious of another:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Item [0]
- **Agent 2**: Item [3]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
