Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  77  54  69
1  48  79  28  96
2  63  32  92  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 77 54 69]
 [48 79 28 96]
 [63 32 92 65]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we must consider the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [91, 77, 54, 69]
- Agent 1: [48, 79, 28, 96]
- Agent 2: [63, 32, 92, 65]

Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 91 for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 96 for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 92 for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 77 for Agent 0).

Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, Agent 1 gets item 3, and Agent 2 gets item 2. This allocation maximizes each agent's highest valuation that isn't claimed by another agent with a higher preference.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their highest available valuations, minimizing potential envy among them.
