Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  40   7   1
1  91  27  76  75
2  63  79  83  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives from their allocation. Given the valuations, the goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 46.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 91.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 89.

2. **Attempt to satisfy the highest individual valuations**:
   - Give item 0 to Agent 1 since they value it the most at 91.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest at 89.

3. **Allocate the remaining items**:
   - Items 1 and 2 are left to be allocated.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest among the remaining items at 83.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest among the remaining items at 40.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0.
   - Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation aims to satisfy the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's preferences given the constraints.
