Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  14  79  76
1  32  38  51   1
2  96  45  95  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing individual valuations. Our goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also attempting to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's first examine each agent's preferences:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 76

- **Agent 1** values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 1

- **Agent 2** values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 66

Given the valuations, let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (96).
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (79).
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (38).
4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for Item 3 (76).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers the highest-valued items for each agent based on their preferences.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
