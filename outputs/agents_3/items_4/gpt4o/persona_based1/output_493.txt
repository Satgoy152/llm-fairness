Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  86  14   1
1  64  11  15  98
2  55  20  32  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. We will aim for an allocation where no agent envies another agent's allocation, given their own valuation of the items.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation step by step:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (86), followed by item 0 (30).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (98), followed by item 0 (64).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (74), followed by item 0 (55).

2. **First allocation based on highest single item value:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (98).

3. **Remove the allocated item and evaluate remaining high-value items:**
   - Agent 0 now has item 1 (86) as the highest valued available item.
   - Agent 1 has item 0 (64) as the next highest valued item.
   - Agent 2 has item 0 (55) as the next highest valued item.

4. **Second allocation based on remaining highest value:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (86).

5. **Evaluate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 64.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 55 and item 2 at 32.

6. **Third allocation based on remaining high value:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (64).

7. **Last allocation for the remaining item:**
   - Item 2 is left, and it will be allocated to Agent 2.

Following these steps, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation attempts to minimize envy based on the agents' valuation of the items.
