Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  57  87  31
1  84  89  73  51
2  27  77  28  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that no agent feels envy towards another's allocation, given the valuations provided. An envy-free allocation means each agent should feel they received at least as much value as they perceive any other agent has received.

Let's consider the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [43, 57, 87, 31]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [84, 89, 73, 51]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [27, 77, 28, 82]

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we will attempt to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring every item is distributed.

### Potential Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (87).
2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: This item has the highest value for Agent 1 (89).
3. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: This item has the highest value for Agent 2 (82).
4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: This balances the distribution, as Item 0 also has a high value for Agent 1 (84).

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 0.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value, with Agent 1 receiving two items due to their strong valuation of both Items 0 and 1, which maximizes their satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the valuations and ensures that each agent feels their allocation is fair given their personal valuations of the items.
