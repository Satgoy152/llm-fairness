Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  89   0  51  87
1  92  78  32  74
2  85  75  79   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. One standard approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) criterion. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we can attempt to find an allocation that is as envy-free as possible.

Let's consider the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 87

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 74

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 1

A potential fair allocation is:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (92).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly (87), and Agent 1 already has a high-value item.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it highly (79).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it (75), and it balances the allocation among the agents.

This allocation attempts to respect the valuations and minimize envy as much as possible, given the constraints.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
