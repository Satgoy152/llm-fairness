Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  27  25   0
1  55  57   9  34
2  84  37  11  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we need to consider the agents' valuations and ensure each agent receives an allocation they value highly relative to other agents.

Here's the given valuation table for clarity:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 91 | 27 | 25 | 0  |
| 1            | 55 | 57 | 9  | 34 |
| 2            | 84 | 37 | 11 | 79 |

A potential allocation should maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (91), which is also highly valued by Agent 2 (84). However, Agent 0 values it the highest.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (57), which aligns with their highest valuation and is more than Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (79) the highest, which is more than other agents value it.
4. For item 2, which has the lowest individual valuations, we can consider giving it to **Agent 0** to balance the distribution, as Agent 1 and Agent 2 value it the least.

### Proposed Allocations
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as well, since it's the least valued by the others, and Agent 0 can take another item without causing envy.

This gives us the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item with an attempt to minimize envy based on their valuation preferences.
