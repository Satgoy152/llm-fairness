Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  18  64  58
1   9  49  74  13
2  57  15  84  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the minimum utility. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's utility is as balanced as possible, minimizing the potential for envy.

### Valuations Matrix
Let's restate the valuations matrix:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 36 | 18 | 64 | 58 |
| 1            | 9  | 49 | 74 | 13 |
| 2            | 57 | 15 | 84 | 83 |

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (64) and item 3 (58).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (74), followed by item 1 (49).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (84), followed by item 3 (83).

### Allocation Process
- **Item 2** is valued highly by all agents. To create a fair allocation, we should consider giving it to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- **Item 3** should go to Agent 0, who values it second highest after item 2.
- **Item 0** should be allocated to Agent 2, as they value it the most after item 2.
- **Item 1** should be allocated to Agent 1, who values it the highest among all items for that agent.

### Final Allocations
- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and attempts to balance the distribution of valuations across agents.

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation adheres to the requirements by ensuring all items are assigned, each agent receives an integer number of items, and attempts to minimize envy by balancing the distribution according to the agents' valuations.
