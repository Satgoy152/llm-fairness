Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  41  51  44
1  29  73  81  66
2  57  17  44  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we need to allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents in such a way that the distribution is fair, and ideally, envy-free. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [91, 41, 51, 44]
- Agent 1: [29, 73, 81, 66]
- Agent 2: [57, 17, 44, 87]

Since there are only 4 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the other two agents will receive one item each.

One straightforward approach is to use each agent's highest valuation to decide initial allocations, ensuring that overall envy is minimized. We'll attempt to allocate one high-value item to each agent initially and then distribute the remaining item based on residual valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Allocate high-value items to each agent based on their highest valuation:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (91), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (81), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (87), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate the remaining item 1:**
   - Item 1 is left. Here are the valuations for item 1:
     - Agent 0: 41
     - Agent 1: 73
     - Agent 2: 17
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

These allocations minimize potential envy across agents based on their valuations. Let's write down this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation results in each agent receiving items in a manner that attempts to respect their preferences as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations and the total number of items.
