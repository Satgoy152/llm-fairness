Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  35  81  19
1  49  24  27  94
2  90  85  13  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we should consider each agent's valuation and try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while minimizing envy between them. Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 19

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 94

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 85

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Item 0 is most valuable to Agent 2.
- Item 1 is most valuable to Agent 2.
- Item 2 is most valuable to Agent 0.
- Item 3 is most valuable to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest valued items as much as possible.

The allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
