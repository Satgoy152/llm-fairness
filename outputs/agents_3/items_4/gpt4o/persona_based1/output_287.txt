Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  73   3  61
1   4   3  37  85
2  17  60  70  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they could receive by switching with another agent, based on their own valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for clarity:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 4  | 73 | 3  | 61 |
| 1          | 4  | 3  | 37 | 85 |
| 2          | 17 | 60 | 70 | 70 |

**Step-by-step Fair Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for item 1 (73) and item 3 (61).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 3 (85) and item 2 (37).
3. **Agent 2** has relatively high valuations for item 2 (70) and item 1 (60).

Considering these preferences, we can aim for the following allocations:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 since they value it the most.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 since they value it the most.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 since they value it the most.

Now, we have only item 0 left:
- Since item 0 has a low valuation for all agents, we can allocate it to any agent without causing significant envy. However, Agent 2 has the highest relative valuation for item 0, so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation respects each agent's highest preferences as much as possible and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
