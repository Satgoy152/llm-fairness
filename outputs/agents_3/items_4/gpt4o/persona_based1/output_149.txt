Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  39  93  13
1  84   5  58  80
2  34  95  91  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Below is the valuation matrix for reference:

```
       Item
       0   1   2   3
Agent
0    36  39  93  13
1    84   5  58  80
2    34  95  91  66
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we will consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy.

#### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (93).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (84).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (95).

2. **Allocate the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - The only remaining item is 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (80), followed by Agent 2 (66), and Agent 0 (13).

4. **Allocate the remaining item 3:**
   - To minimize envy, allocate item 3 to Agent 1. This allocation allows Agent 1 to have a strong valuation for their bundle, reducing potential envy.

The allocation now looks like this:

- Agent 0 has Item 2.
- Agent 1 has Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 has Item 1.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and minimizes envy, based on their highest value items.

#### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
