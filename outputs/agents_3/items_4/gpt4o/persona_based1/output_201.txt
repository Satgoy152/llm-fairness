Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  89  18  90
1  18  53  86  76
2  50  15  86   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness or minimizing envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**

   |       | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
   |-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | Agent 0 | 83     | 89     | 18     | 90     |
   | Agent 1 | 18     | 53     | 86     | 76     |
   | Agent 2 | 50     | 15     | 86     | 5      |

2. **Analyzing Maximum Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (90).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (86).
   - Agent 2 values Item 2 the highest (86).

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Remaining Items and Valuations:**
   - Remaining items: Item 0, Item 1.
   - Remaining agents: Agent 2.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for Item 0 (50) compared to others for the remaining items. 
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

6. **Final Allocation of Leftover Item:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values Item 1 (89) the highest among the remaining allocations.

By following this method, each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, leading to a fair allocation.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
