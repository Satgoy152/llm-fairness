Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  85  26  53
1  29  11  90  36
2  94  52  64  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible. The concept of envy-freeness suggests that each agent should feel they received a bundle of items at least as good as what any other agent received, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

**Agent 0:**
- Values: Item 0 = 15, Item 1 = 85, Item 2 = 26, Item 3 = 53

**Agent 1:**
- Values: Item 0 = 29, Item 1 = 11, Item 2 = 90, Item 3 = 36

**Agent 2:**
- Values: Item 0 = 94, Item 1 = 52, Item 2 = 64, Item 3 = 69

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 2** highly values Item 0 (94). Since no other agent values Item 0 more than Agent 2, allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 2 (90). This is the highest value for any item across all agents. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values Item 1 (85). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. For the remaining Item 3, **Agent 2** values it at 69, which is the highest remaining value across all agents for this item. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation respects the highest preferences of each agent while considering the values from a comparative standpoint.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items, and the envy among them is minimized based on their respective valuations.
