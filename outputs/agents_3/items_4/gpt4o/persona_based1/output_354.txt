Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  37  63   3
1  26  83  79  88
2  98  57  34  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, the goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [59, 37, 63, 3]
- Agent 1's valuations: [26, 83, 79, 88]
- Agent 2's valuations: [98, 57, 34, 57]

Let's find an allocation where each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their own valuations. We want to minimize envy by allocating items based on agents' highest valuations.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (value 63)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (value 88)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value 98)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 1 (value 57)

With these allocations, each agent receives items that they value highly, which should minimize envy and make the allocation appear fair from their perspectives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
