Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  46   6  99  37
1  81  21  84  19
2  24   8  90  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness among the agents, we can use a method like maximizing the minimum value each agent receives (often called the maximin strategy). 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [46, 6, 99, 37]
- Agent 1 values: [81, 21, 84, 19]
- Agent 2 values: [24, 8, 90, 55]

A possible allocation strategy is to ensure each agent receives at least one item they highly value to minimize potential envy.

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (99)
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (81)
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (90), but it's already assigned, so we consider the next highest: item 3 (55)

2. After these initial assignments, allocate remaining items to balance the distribution:
   - Item 1 is valued very low by all, so it can be given to Agent 0 since they get the least value from item 2.

Resulting allocations:
- Agent 0: items 2, 1
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: item 3

This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives at least one item they highly value, given the constraints.

{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
