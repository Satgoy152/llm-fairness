Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  48  13  74
1  21  65  68  48
2  28  22  33  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share considering their own valuations. The goal is to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's evaluate how we can allocate the items:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: Values items as [81, 48, 13, 74]
- **Agent 1**: Values items as [21, 65, 68, 48]
- **Agent 2**: Values items as [28, 22, 33, 55]

### Strategy:
1. **Maximize individual satisfaction**: Start by allocating the highest valued item to each agent that others value less, if possible, to reduce the chance of envy.
2. **Consider alternate allocations**: Evaluate the remaining items and allocate them to minimize envy across all agents.

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Item 0** (81, 21, 28): Assign to Agent 0 as they value it most.
2. **Item 1** (48, 65, 22): Assign to Agent 1 since they value it most.
3. **Item 3** (74, 48, 55): Assign to Agent 2 since Agent 1 already got their highest-valued item and Agent 2 values this more than Item 2.
4. **Item 2** (13, 68, 33): Assign to Agent 1 as a second item because it maximizes their total value without causing much envy (Agent 1 values it the highest).

### Resulting Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [0]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 2]
- **Agent 2**: [3]

This allocation minimizes envy and maximizes satisfaction based on individual valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
