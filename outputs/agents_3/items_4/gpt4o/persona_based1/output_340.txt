Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  47  18  28
1  15  22   5  45
2  71  86  60  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution in which each agent perceives their own allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their valuations. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 (60), Item 1 (47), Item 2 (18), Item 3 (28)
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 (15), Item 1 (22), Item 2 (5), Item 3 (45)
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 (71), Item 1 (86), Item 2 (60), Item 3 (10)

We should consider the total value each agent perceives for various combinations of items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate Item 0 (highest value for Agent 2):**  
   - Agent 2 values it at 71, which is higher than any other agent's value for a single item.

2. **Allocate Item 1 (highest value for Agent 2):**  
   - Agent 2 values it at 86, which is again the highest single valuation across all agents.

3. **Allocate Item 2 (highest value for Agent 2):**  
   - Agent 2 values it at 60, which is the highest among all agents. However, since Agent 2 already has two items, we need to consider another allocation to maintain fairness and distribute the items.

4. **Allocate Item 3 based on remaining values:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 28 and Agent 1 at 45. It should go to Agent 1 as it is the highest remaining value that Agent 1 can get, given Agent 2's allocation.

Thus, we want to balance the allocation to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0:** No items, as Agent 0's highest valued item among remaining is less than Agent 1's choice.
- **Agent 1:** Item 3, which is their highest valued item not allocated to Agent 2.
- **Agent 2:** Items 0 and 1, which are their highest valued items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the maximum possible value from the items available given the constraints. 

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution aims to maximize the perceived fairness based on the given valuations.
