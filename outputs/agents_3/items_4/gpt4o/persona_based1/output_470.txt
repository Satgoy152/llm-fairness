Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  99  79  86
1  65  97  54  37
2  24  78  71  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means each agent feels they received as much value as any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 3] valued at [32, 99, 79, 86]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2, 3] valued at [65, 97, 54, 37]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1, 2, 3] valued at [24, 78, 71, 54]

We aim to allocate the items so that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

One potential allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most after item 1. Since item 1 is taken, assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. The remaining item is item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it provides a relatively high value for them and balances out the allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the perceived values are reasonably balanced.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
