Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  84   4  69
1  55   5  37  80
2  96  49  23  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. 

To achieve this, let's first sum up the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 64 + 84 + 4 + 69 = 221
- Agent 1: 55 + 5 + 37 + 80 = 177
- Agent 2: 96 + 49 + 23 + 28 = 196

Given these total valuations, we can aim to allocate items to maximize fairness. We can use the following heuristic approach:

1. **Maximize total value per agent:** Attempt to give each agent items that maximize their individual total value while maintaining envy-freeness.

2. **Prioritize high-value items:** Start by allocating the most valuable items for each agent based on their valuation.

Let's attempt an allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 as 84 and item 3 as 69, which are the highest for this agent.
- **Agent 1** values item 3 as 80, which is the highest for this agent.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 as 96, which is the highest for this agent.

We cannot directly allocate the highest valued items to each agent because item 3 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. Also, Agent 0 has high valuations for item 1, and Agent 2 for item 0.

Therefore, we attempt the following allocation balancing fairness and envy-freeness:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (84) and Item 3 (69)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (37)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (96)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value and reduces potential envy:

- Agent 0 receives items with total value 153, which is the maximum they can get without creating envy.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, which is the next best option after removing the items taken by Agent 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 0, which is their highest priority item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
