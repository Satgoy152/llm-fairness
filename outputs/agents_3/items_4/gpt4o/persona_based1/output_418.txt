Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  44   9   2  91
1  12  83   0   0
2  41  38  99  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we should aim for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their valuation, while also considering the overall fairness across all agents. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 3 (91) > Item 0 (44) > Item 1 (9) > Item 2 (2)
- Agent 1 values: Item 1 (83) > Item 0 (12) > Item 2 (0) = Item 3 (0)
- Agent 2 values: Item 2 (99) > Item 3 (49) > Item 0 (41) > Item 1 (38)

A possible allocation that reduces potential envy and ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value is:

1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item.
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as they also value it significantly and it complements their overall valuation.

This allocation ensures:
- Agent 0 receives their top-valued item.
- Agent 1 receives their top-valued item.
- Agent 2 receives their top two-valued items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, reducing the likelihood of envy.
