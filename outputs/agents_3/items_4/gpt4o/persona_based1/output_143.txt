Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  17   8  83  28
1  87  58  92  62
2  99  26   4  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free or at least a balanced allocation. An envy-free allocation is challenging with such small numbers and integer constraints, but we can try to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items 0, 1, 2, 3 as 17, 8, 83, 28 respectively.
- Agent 1: Values items 0, 1, 2, 3 as 87, 58, 92, 62 respectively.
- Agent 2: Values items 0, 1, 2, 3 as 99, 26, 4, 12 respectively.

Considering these valuations, we aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total perceived value for each agent while trying to balance the allocated values.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (99). Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 makes sense.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (92). Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 is optimal for them.
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most after the highest valued item (83 which is taken by Agent 1). Allocating item 3 to Agent 0 is suitable.
4. The remaining item, item 1, can be given to Agent 1, as they have the second-highest valuation for it and currently have fewer items.

This allocation satisfies each agent to some extent based on their preferences and minimizes envy as much as possible.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation uses all 4 items and ensures each agent receives items in a way that attempts to maximize their individual satisfaction based on valuations.
