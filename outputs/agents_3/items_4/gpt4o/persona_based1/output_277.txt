Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  27  64  16
1  91  72  10  59
2  55  36   2  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: 
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 64.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 16.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents Based on Their Highest Valuation**:
   - Start with the item that has the most significant difference in valuations between the highest and the second-highest.
   - Allocate items to reduce envy as much as possible.

3. **Allocate by Maximum Valuation**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (most valued by Agent 1).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (most valued by Agent 0).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (most valued by Agent 1).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 has a reasonable valuation and ensures each agent gets at least one item).

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Check allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item and the sum of items equals the total available.

Based on the above allocations, here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
