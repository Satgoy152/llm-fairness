Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  67  75  42
1  13  25  27  32
2   0  37  59  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as what they might get by swapping with another agent. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to find such an allocation:

1. **Consider the Highest Value**: Each agent values items differently, so we aim to allocate items based on maximizing individual satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (87), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (32), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (76), but since it is already allocated, we consider the next highest valued item for agent 2, which is item 2 (59).

3. **Handling Remaining Items**:
   - After the initial allocation, items 1 and 2 remain. 
   - Agent 2 will receive item 2, as it was determined in the previous step.
   - For item 1, since agent 0 values it second highest (67), and agent 1 values it second highest (25), it is best allocated to agent 0 to maintain the highest possible satisfaction.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting an allocation that maximizes their individual utility given the constraints, and it minimizes envy, as each agent receives items they highly value.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
