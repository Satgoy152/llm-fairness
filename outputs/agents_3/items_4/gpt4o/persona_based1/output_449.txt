Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  82  21  80
1  18   8  78  23
2  33  29  33   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. Our goal is to allocate all 4 items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their respective valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 37, Item 1 = 82, Item 2 = 21, Item 3 = 80
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 18, Item 1 = 8, Item 2 = 78, Item 3 = 23
- Agent 2: Item 0 = 33, Item 1 = 29, Item 2 = 33, Item 3 = 1

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can follow a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while also considering the overall fairness. 

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 values items 1 and 3 highly, so we assign them item 1.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so we assign them item 2.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most, so we assign them item 0.
4. This leaves item 3. Agent 0 values it highly, so we assign it to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation should be fairly envy-free based on the initial valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
