Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  67  96  52
1  49  51  68   0
2  36  81  84  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given the agents' valuations, letâ€™s analyze the best approach.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: Items 0 (37), 1 (67), 2 (96), 3 (52)
- Agent 1: Items 0 (49), 1 (51), 2 (68), 3 (0)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (36), 1 (81), 2 (84), 3 (67)

### Steps to Allocate:
1. **Assign item 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 96.
   
2. **Assign item 1 to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 81.
   
3. **Assign item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 49, and item 1 is already allocated.
   
4. **Assign item 3 to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the second-highest valuation for item 3 (67) compared to others not having received their highest available preference.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items and minimizes overall envy.

### Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
