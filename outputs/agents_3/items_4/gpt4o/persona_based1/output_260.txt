Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  45  39  26
1  80  37  24  49
2  33  75  58  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that respects the agents' valuations and minimizes envy. We will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility to ensure fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 39.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 49.

2. **Initial Tentative Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0: Has items 0 and 2, valued at 95 and 39, total = 134.
   - Agent 1: Has item 3, valued at 49.
   - Agent 2: Has item 1, valued at 75.

4. **Adjustment for Fairness:**
   - Since Agent 1 has the least total value, check if redistributing items can improve fairness.
   - Consider swapping item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to improve Agent 1's total value.
   - New tentative allocation:
     - Agent 0: Item 0 (value = 95)
     - Agent 1: Items 2 and 3 (values = 24 + 49 = 73)
     - Agent 2: Item 1 (value = 75)

5. **Final Check:**
   - Agent 0: Value = 95
   - Agent 1: Value = 73
   - Agent 2: Value = 75

This allocation is balanced and fair given the constraints of integer allocations per agent and maximizing each agent's share while minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
