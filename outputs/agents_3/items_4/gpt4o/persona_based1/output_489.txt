Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  10  53  28
1  22  96  94  75
2  86  39  20  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the goal of minimizing envy, we can use the principle of maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  32  10  53  28
1  22  96  94  75
2  86  39  20  31
```

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation tries to minimize envy among the agents. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 2 (53), so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 1 (96), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 0 (86), so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. The remaining item, item 3, should be allocated in a way that continues to minimize envy. Agent 1 values item 3 (75) more than the others do, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to give each agent an item they value highly, aiming to reduce envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has been given items they highly value, which helps in achieving a fair division by minimizing envy.
