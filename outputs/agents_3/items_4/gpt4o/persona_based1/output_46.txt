Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  55   0  21
1   6  97   2  62
2  31  20  38  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences. The goal is to assign the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, based on their valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 0:10, 1:55, 2:0, 3:21
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 0:6, 1:97, 2:2, 3:62
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 0:31, 1:20, 2:38, 3:99

A good way to start is by allocating the highest valued item to each agent if possible:

1. For Agent 0, the most valued item is 1 (value of 55).
2. For Agent 1, the most valued item is 1 (value of 97), but since we must avoid double allocation, we can consider their second preference, which is item 3 (value of 62).
3. For Agent 2, the most valued item is 3 (value of 99), but it has already been considered for Agent 1. The next highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 2 (value of 38).

Given this, we can start the allocation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for them).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value, as their highest is taken).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value for them).

Now, we have allocated 3 items, and one item (item 0) is left to allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 10, Agent 1 at 6, and Agent 2 at 31. Thus, item 0 should be allocated to Agent 2 for the highest value.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]

This allocation respects the highest preferences possible given the constraints and attempts to minimize envy.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
