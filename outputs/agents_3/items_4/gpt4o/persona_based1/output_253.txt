Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  24  60  14
1  80  22  86  97
2  56  53  99   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible, given that there are only four items and three agents. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: 28, 24, 60, 14
- Agent 1 values the items as: 80, 22, 86, 97
- Agent 2 values the items as: 56, 53, 99, 6

We will aim to give each agent an item that they value highly, while trying to prevent any agent from envying another's allocation.

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 2, with a valuation of 99, which is the highest across all agents for any item. It's reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3, with a valuation of 97. Additionally, Agent 1 also values item 2 highly (86), but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 2, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** is left with items 0 and 1. Agent 0 values item 0 more than item 1 (28 vs. 24). However, both items are relatively close in value for Agent 0, but we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 0 to maximize fairness and reduce potential envy, as the other items have been allocated based on higher preferences from other agents.

4. **Agent 0** can also receive item 1, as it is not yet allocated, and Agent 0 is the only one remaining without a second item.

The allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and minimizes envy given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
