Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  85  31  30
1  61   7  47  56
2  51  73  13  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. A simple approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation criterion, where we try to minimize the envy each agent might feel towards any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [33, 85, 31, 30]
- Agent 1: [61, 7, 47, 56]
- Agent 2: [51, 73, 13, 59]

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 61.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 85.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 47.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 59.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0 to Agent 1
   - Item 1 to Agent 0
   - Item 2 to Agent 1
   - Item 3 to Agent 2

3. **Check for Over-Allocation:**
   - Agent 1 has two items (0 and 2), while Agent 0 and Agent 2 have one each. Since we need each agent to have at least one item and the allocation to be fair, we will adjust.

4. **Reallocate to Balance and Ensure Fairness:**
   - Give Item 0 to Agent 1 (since they value it the highest).
   - Give Item 1 to Agent 0 (since they value it the highest).
   - Give Item 3 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it the highest).
   - For Item 2, Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 47, and Agent 2 values it at 13. We will give this item to Agent 0 since Agent 1 already has an item.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]

This allocation is fair as each agent gets items based on their highest valuations and ensures that no agent feels overly envious of another's allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
