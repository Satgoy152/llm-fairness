Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  77  94  17
1  84  29  44  41
2  71  34  57  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 29 44 41]
 [71 34 57 68]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One well-known method to achieve this is the "Round Robin" method, where agents take turns choosing their most valued item that is still available. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [95, 77, 94, 17]
- Agent 1: [84, 29, 44, 41]
- Agent 2: [71, 34, 57, 68]

We can begin the allocation by letting each agent choose their most valued item in turns. The order in which agents pick can be determined randomly or based on a predetermined sequence. Let's assume the order is 0, 1, 2, and then repeat.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0's turn**: 
   - Agent 0's most valued item is item 0 (value 95).
   - Agent 0 picks item 0.

2. **Agent 1's turn**: 
   - Agent 1's most valued item after item 0 is item 0 (value 84), but it's already taken. Next is item 2 (value 44).
   - Agent 1 picks item 2.

3. **Agent 2's turn**: 
   - Agent 2's most valued item after items 0 and 2 is item 3 (value 68).
   - Agent 2 picks item 3.

4. **Agent 0's turn**: 
   - Agent 0's remaining most valued item is item 1 (value 77).
   - Agent 0 picks item 1.

Now, all items have been allocated, and the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation is envy-free because each agent took their most valued item available when it was their turn. 

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
