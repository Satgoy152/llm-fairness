Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  60  28  87
1  52  63  26   5
2  19  23  29  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

Let's begin by examining the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 has relatively balanced valuations but values item 1 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest, followed by item 2.

A common approach is to attempt a round-robin or a highest-bid allocation where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item that is still available. Given the small number of agents and items, we can make a direct allocation attempt:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item is item 0 (90) and item 3 (87). 
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item is item 1 (63). 
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item is item 3 (89). 
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have one item left, item 2:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 28.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 26.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 29.

Given that Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, it makes sense to allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

The final allocation would be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 3

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, considering the constraints provided.

The JSON representation of the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
