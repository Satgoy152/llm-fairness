Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  62  88  17  57
1  66  62  41  40
2  51   3  68  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division and envy-freeness, we can use a variety of methods. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that each agent will not envy another agent's allocation after possibly removing one item from the envied agent's bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (62), 1 (88), 2 (17), 3 (57)
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (66), 1 (62), 2 (41), 3 (40)
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (51), 1 (3), 2 (68), 3 (70)

A potential allocation that satisfies fairness could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2

Let's verify this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1 with a value of 88.
- Agent 1 receives item 0 with a value of 66.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3 with a combined value of 68 + 70 = 138.

This allocation is relatively envy-free, as:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 3 highly and together they provide substantial value.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
