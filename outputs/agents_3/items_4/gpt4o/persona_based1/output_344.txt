Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  91  54  48
1  83  39  28   5
2  19   9  47  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using a method that ensures no agent feels another agent has a significantly better allocation. Given the valuations, let's consider potential allocations.

Let's review the agents' preferences:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 48

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 5

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 87

To reach an envy-free allocation, we should aim for each agent to get the item that gives them the highest value possible, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 4.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 (value 91)
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 (value 83)
- Agent 2 receives Items 2 and 3 (values 47 and 87)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and no agent is left without an item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
