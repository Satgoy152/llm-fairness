Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  90  40  12
1  76  43  38  94
2  49  30   9  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly four, we should aim for an allocation that potentially minimizes envy among agents. Envy-freeness is a desirable property where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0: [16, 90, 40, 12]
- Agent 1: [76, 43, 38, 94]
- Agent 2: [49, 30, 9, 29]

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring envy-freeness as closely as possible. In this context, it might involve giving each agent one of their most valued items, or at least ensuring no agent significantly envies another's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate the highest value items to agents with the highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (90), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (94), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 0 (49), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate the remaining item:**
   - The remaining item is item 2. Agent 0 values this item at 40, Agent 1 at 38, and Agent 2 at 9.
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2]
- Agent 1 receives item [3]
- Agent 2 receives item [0]

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their highly valued items, and no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own given the circumstances.

### JSON Format of Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives items in a manner that attempts to minimize envy.
