Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  70   9  93
1  77  98  54  86
2  97   8  73  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while attempting to minimize envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate them in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's consider each agent's total valuation for the items to determine a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Values = [56, 70, 9, 93]
- Agent 1: Values = [77, 98, 54, 86]
- Agent 2: Values = [97, 8, 73, 45]

A potential approach to minimize envy is to use the following steps:

1. Begin by allocating the item with the highest individual valuation. 
2. Continue allocating items to the agents based on maximizing their utility while ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item.
3. Check if reallocating any item might reduce envy further.

Let's allocate items based on the above strategy:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value by Agent 1: 98).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value by Agent 2: 97).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value by Agent 0: 93).
4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value by Agent 2: 73).

By following this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the items are allocated according to the highest valuations to reduce envy as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
