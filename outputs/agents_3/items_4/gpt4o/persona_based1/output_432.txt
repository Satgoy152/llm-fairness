Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  40  46  13
1  54  51  35  53
2  10  72  18  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible to envy-freeness. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent received, based on their own valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 very highly, so we will allocate item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 3 compared to the other agents, so we will allocate item 3 to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to them.
4. The remaining item, item 2, should be allocated based on minimizing envy or achieving the highest utility for the remaining agents. Item 2 will be allocated to **Agent 0** as they have the highest valuation among unallocated options.

Given these considerations, the allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with an attempt to minimize envy.
