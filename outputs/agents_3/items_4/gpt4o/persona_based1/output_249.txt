Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  14  20  49
1  79  95  78  37
2  22   6  61   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent is satisfied relative to their own valuations. Here's a proposed allocation:

Let's consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Look at which items each agent values the most.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (94).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (95).
   - Agent 2 values Item 2 the most (61).

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate each agent their most valued item.
   - Agent 0 gets Item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets Item 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Item**: The remaining item is Item 3.
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Agent 2 values it at 3.

   Since Agent 0 values Item 3 the most, it makes sense to allocate it to Agent 0 to reduce envy.

By this allocation, each agent receives their most valued item, and Agent 0 receives an additional item that they value considerably more than the other agents, ensuring the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
