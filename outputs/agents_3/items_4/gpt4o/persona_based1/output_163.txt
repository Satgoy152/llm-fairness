Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  26  75  56
1  51  76  65  28
2  92  65  76  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and envy-free, we aim to distribute the items so that no agent feels another agent has a better allocation based on their own valuations. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be complex, we can strive for a balanced distribution based on the given valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 56

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 65
  - Item 3: 28

- Agent 2: 
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 64

To simplify the problem, we can use an approach that considers maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing the maximum envy.

### Allocation Suggestion:
1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Item 0 is 92).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Item 1 is 76).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Item 2 is 75).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for Item 3 is 56, while Agent 2 would envy Agent 0 less for this allocation).

Let's see the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, which they value at 75 and 56, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, which they value highest at 76.
- Agent 2 receives item 0, which they value highest at 92.

This allocation aims to balance fairness by giving each agent at least one item they value highly, while minimizing envy.
