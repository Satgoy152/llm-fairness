Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  15  12  20
1  38  53  39  39
2  34  55  82  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: 35, 15, 12, 20
- Agent 1 values items as: 38, 53, 39, 39
- Agent 2 values items as: 34, 55, 82, 34

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the following approach:

1. Start by allocating the highest value item of each agent, if possible.
2. Try to ensure that each agent's total valuation of received items is roughly balanced.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (82), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (53), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (35), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. For the remaining item 3, Agent 1 and Agent 0 both value it equally (39 and 20, respectively). Assign item 3 to **Agent 1**, as they have a higher overall valuation for the item.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3].
- Agent 2 gets items [2].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, and it attempts to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
