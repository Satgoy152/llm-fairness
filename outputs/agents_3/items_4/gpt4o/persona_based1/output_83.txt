Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0   2  90  14  68
1  23  53  53  61
2  43  70  68  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given the constraints. The key challenge is to ensure the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible with the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 14
  - Item 3: 68

- Agent 1 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 61

- Agent 2 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 33

To find a fair allocation, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. 

One possible allocation strategy is:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it is highly valued by them (90).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it is highly valued by them (68).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as it is highly valued by them (61).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they value it more than the others (43).

This allocation gives each agent an item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's present this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation should ensure that all items are distributed while considering the agents' preferences.
