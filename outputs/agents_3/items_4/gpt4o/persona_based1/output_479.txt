Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  19  42  59
1   8  34  58  73
2  67  56  37  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle, given the constraints. Since the number of items (4) equals the number of agents (3), each agent cannot receive the same number of items. Therefore, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each. Our goal is to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**'s valuations: [36, 19, 42, 59]
- **Agent 1**'s valuations: [8, 34, 58, 73]
- **Agent 2**'s valuations: [67, 56, 37, 95]

Considering these valuations, we can aim to allocate items in a way that minimizes overall envy. One potential allocation strategy is:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 42) and item 0 (value 36). This gives Agent 0 a total value of 78.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 34). This gives Agent 1 a total value of 34.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (value 95). This gives Agent 2 a total value of 95.

This allocation seems favorable as it provides Agent 2 with the item they value the most (95), Agent 0 with two items they value reasonably well, and Agent 1 with the remaining item, which is the one Agent 1 values most after item 3.

Let's put this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints of the problem by ensuring all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
