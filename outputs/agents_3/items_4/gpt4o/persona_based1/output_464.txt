Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  49  53  24
1  76  38  18   7
2  27  20  28  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent feels envy towards another agent's allocation. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 58), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 76), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 95), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Now, item 2 is left. Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (value 53), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures an envy-free distribution as each agent receives their highest-valued available item. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
