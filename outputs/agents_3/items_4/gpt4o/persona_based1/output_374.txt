Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  65   6  29  40
1  49  85  56  99
2   1  11  42  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [65, 6, 29, 40]
Agent 1: [49, 85, 56, 99]
Agent 2: [1, 11, 42, 36]
```

One approach to allocate the items fairly is to ensure each agent receives items that they value highly while minimizing potential envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (65), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (99), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (42), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. The remaining item, 1, is valued highly by agent 1 (85), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.

The allocations based on these considerations are:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation should minimize envy because each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
