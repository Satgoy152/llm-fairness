Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  13  31  37
1  61  90  84  34
2  38  60  82  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free to the extent possible with integer allocations, we need to distribute the 4 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations. We'll attempt to make sure each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 53, Item 1 = 13, Item 2 = 31, Item 3 = 37
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 61, Item 1 = 90, Item 2 = 84, Item 3 = 34
- Agent 2's valuations: Item 0 = 38, Item 1 = 60, Item 2 = 82, Item 3 = 14

One possible way to allocate the items fairly is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.

This allocation can be justified as follows:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest among all items, which is 53.
- Agent 1 values Items 1 and 2 very highly, with values of 90 and 84, respectively.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3, which isn't their highest valued item, but it's still part of a configuration where each agent gets an item, and the overall allocation tries to maximize individual satisfaction.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on their valuations to maximize fairness.
