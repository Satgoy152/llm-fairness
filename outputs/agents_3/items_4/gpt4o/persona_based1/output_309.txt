Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  25  35   8
1  92  26  89  38
2  33  45  76  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. In this problem, we aim to find an allocation such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 35, Item 1 at 25, Item 2 at 35, Item 3 at 8
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 92, Item 1 at 26, Item 2 at 89, Item 3 at 38
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 at 33, Item 1 at 45, Item 2 at 76, Item 3 at 72

To achieve a fair allocation, we consider the following strategy:
1. Assign each agent the item they value the most if it doesn't cause envy.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and no agent feels envious.

Step-by-step allocation:
- **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most (92), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values Item 2 the most (76), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** values Items 0 and 2 equally but both are allocated, so we consider the next best available option, which is Item 1 (25) for Agent 0.
- **Agent 2** values Item 3 second highest after getting Item 2, allocating Item 3 to Agent 2.

Let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0 has Item 1.
- Agent 1 has Item 0.
- Agent 2 has Items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item, and no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, achieving envy-freeness.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
