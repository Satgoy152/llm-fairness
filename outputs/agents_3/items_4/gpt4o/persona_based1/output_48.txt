Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  39  17  10
1  33  26  35  14
2  58   9  31  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we want to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another's bundle, if possible. The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3
0  63  39  17  10
1  33  26  35  14
2  58   9  31  13
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (63), followed by item 1 (39).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (35), followed by item 0 (33).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (58), followed by item 2 (31).

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to give each item to the agent who values it the most, or in a way that minimizes envy.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (63) to Agent 0 because it's their highest valued item, and they value it more than others.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (35) to Agent 1 as it's their highest valued item, and it is also their second-highest value after item 0 which is already allocated.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (13) to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values item 3 more relatively compared to others, and the highest value item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0.

Now, only item 1 is left unallocated. We check who values it the second highest:
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 39.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 26.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 9.

Since Agent 0 values item 1 (39) higher than Agent 1 and Agent 2, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation
Thus, the allocation ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (and minimizing envy) is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
