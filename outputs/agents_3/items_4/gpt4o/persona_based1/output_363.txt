Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  59  74  78
1  26  52  49   3
2   8  35  87  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as far as possible. An envy-free allocation implies that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items as 58, 59, 74, 78.
- Agent 1: Values items as 26, 52, 49, 3.
- Agent 2: Values items as 8, 35, 87, 74.

To achieve a fair division, we aim to distribute items such that each agent gets items they highly value, while minimizing envy.

Given the valuations, item 2 is most valued by Agent 2 (87) and should ideally go to them. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 0 (78) and Agent 2 (74), but slightly more by Agent 0. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0 (58), and item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 (59) and Agent 1 (52).

A potential allocation could be:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it slightly more than Agent 2.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly more than others.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as they have a reasonable valuation and it balances the allocation.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This way, each agent receives items they highly value, and the distribution minimizes envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
