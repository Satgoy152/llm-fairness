Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  58   9  94
1  95  71  46  43
2  39  38  41  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to find an allocation where each agent feels that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share, based on their own valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3
0   0  58   9  94
1  95  71  46  43
2  39  38  41  52
```

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (94) and item 1 (58). 
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (95) and item 1 (71).
- Agent 2 values are more balanced but highest for item 3 (52).

A possible fair allocation that minimizes envy:

1. Agent 0 receives item 3.
2. Agent 1 receives item 0.
3. Agent 2 receives item 2.
4. Item 1 can be given to Agent 1, as it already has considerable value for Agent 1 and is highly valued by them.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, thus minimizing potential envy. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 4 items are allocated.
