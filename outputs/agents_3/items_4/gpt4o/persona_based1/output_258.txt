Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  54  32  12
1  14  66   7  89
2  77   5   9  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. Since there are only 4 items and 3 agents, each agent can receive at most 1 or 2 items. We aim for an allocation that tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 23, Item 1 = 54, Item 2 = 32, Item 3 = 12
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 14, Item 1 = 66, Item 2 = 7, Item 3 = 89
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 = 77, Item 1 = 5, Item 2 = 9, Item 3 = 44

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here is one such allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for them.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for them.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for them.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest valued item for them and no other agent values it highly.

This allocation intends to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, thus reducing potential envy.

The final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.
