Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  81  84  28
1  20  34  30  52
2   5  42  25  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we need to allocate the four items among the three agents in a way that tries to be fair, potentially aiming for an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Identify High-Value Matches:** Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for the items. This can help prioritize allocations that maximize perceived value and minimize envy.

2. **Consider Each Agent's Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 1 has a relatively even distribution of valuations, with item 3 being slightly more valued.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3.

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 since this is their highest value and other agents value it less.
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 since they value them the most.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 as a compromise allocation.

4. **Review for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, which they highly value.
   - Agent 1 gets item 2, which is not optimal, but avoids leaving them empty-handed.
   - Agent 2 gets item 3, their most valued item.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy, recognizing that perfect envy-freeness may not be fully achievable due to the limited number of items and diverse valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to respect their preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
