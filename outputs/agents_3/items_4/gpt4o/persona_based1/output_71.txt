Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  91  32  83
1  20  68  22   6
2  91  47  66  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible under the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can use a method that prioritizes maximizing the total value each agent receives while trying to minimize envy.

First, we analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has a moderate valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and a moderate valuation for item 2.

A potential allocation strategy is to:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it highly and it is their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item, and other agents value it less.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is not highly valued by others and Agent 2 values it moderately.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it highly and this balances the allocation in terms of value.

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued or second most valued item within the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
