Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  65   2  24
1  36  45   6  90
2  17  49  98  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. Given that there are 3 agents and 4 items, each agent will receive at least one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0: 95, Item 1: 65, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 24
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0: 36, Item 1: 45, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 90
- Agent 2 values items as follows: Item 0: 17, Item 1: 49, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 63

To ensure a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, because Agent 0 values it the most (95).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, because Agent 1 values it the most (90).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, because Agent 2 values it the most (98).
4. For the remaining item (Item 1), we need to decide which allocation will minimize envy:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most after Item 0.
   - Agent 1 also values Item 1, but to a lesser extent than Agent 0 does.
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 to a moderate degree.

Given that Agent 0 already has the highest valued item for them (Item 0), we can give Item 1 to Agent 2, as it maximizes Agent 2's total valuation without causing significant envy:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that no agent envies the allocation of another agent, as each has received items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
