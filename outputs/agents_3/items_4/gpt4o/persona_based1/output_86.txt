Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  92  21  73
1  45  32  70  26
2   6  86  18  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, minimizing envy.

Here's a brief analysis of the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 73

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 26

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 18

A good approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (64).
2. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 0 (92).
3. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (70).
4. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (73).

However, this allocation would give all items to Agent 0, which isn't feasible considering we need to distribute the items evenly among agents. Let's adjust the allocation to ensure a fair division:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (most valued by Agent 0, 92).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (most valued by Agent 1, 70).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest valued by Agent 0, 64).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest valued by Agent 2, 18).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to ensure the division is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

The final allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
