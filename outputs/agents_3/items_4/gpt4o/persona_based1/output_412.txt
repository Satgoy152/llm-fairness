Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  37  60  13
1  64   9  57  55
2  59  74  40  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we can use an approach that maximizes the total utility for each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Our goal is to allocate all 4 items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 91, Item 1 at 37, Item 2 at 60, Item 3 at 13.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 64, Item 1 at 9, Item 2 at 57, Item 3 at 55.
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 at 59, Item 1 at 74, Item 2 at 40, Item 3 at 94.

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is Item 0 (91). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is Item 2 (57). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is Item 3 (94). Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, only Item 1 remains unallocated. We should allocate it to the agent who values it the most of those who have not yet received the highest utility from their assigned item:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 at 37.
- Agent 1 values Item 1 at 9.
- Agent 2 values Item 1 at 74.

Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest among the remaining options.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, aiming for envy-freeness.

    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
