Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  22  91  14
1  22  66  29  36
2  91   3  59  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider both the total value each agent receives and any potential envy between agents. One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the maximum sum of values across agents while ensuring each agent's allocation is mutually beneficial.

Given the value matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  56  22  91  14
1  22  66  29  36
2  91   3  59  23
```

We can consider each agent's highest valuation for items, aiming to allocate items in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while maintaining an equitable distribution.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 0.

We can start by assigning each agent the item they value the most:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has received an item they value highly, and we need to allocate the remaining item (item 3) in a way that does not cause significant envy.

Agent valuations for item 3:

- Agent 0: 14
- Agent 1: 36
- Agent 2: 23

Agent 1 values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

This allocation is fair in terms of each agent receiving items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
