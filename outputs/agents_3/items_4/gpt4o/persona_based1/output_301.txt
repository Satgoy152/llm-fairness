Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0   2  57   5  11
1  95  70   9  29
2  34  80  31  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

To achieve this, we need to examine the valuations each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [2, 57, 5, 11]
- Agent 1's valuations: [95, 70, 9, 29]
- Agent 2's valuations: [34, 80, 31, 90]

A common strategy is to allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one of their highest-valued items if possible.

1. Item 0: Highest valued by Agent 1 (95).
2. Item 1: Highest valued by Agent 2 (80).
3. Item 2: Highest valued by Agent 0 (5), but not a significant value. Instead, Item 3 is second highest for Agent 2 (90).
4. Item 3: Second highest valued by Agent 2 (90).

Given this valuation, a potential allocation is:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the only item left after the highest preferences are allocated and Agent 0's initial highest preference (Item 1) went to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that while not every agent receives their top preference, each agent receives items in a way that aims to minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
