Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  16  94  70
1  97  64  88  76
2  87  47  45  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that they receive the most valuable items according to their own preferences.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 85
  - Item 1 at 16
  - Item 2 at 94
  - Item 3 at 70

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 97
  - Item 1 at 64
  - Item 2 at 88
  - Item 3 at 76

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0 at 87
  - Item 1 at 47
  - Item 2 at 45
  - Item 3 at 63

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed and no agent is left without an item, if necessary.

Considering the above strategy:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 the most at 94.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the most at 97.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 the second most, but since Item 0 is taken by Agent 1, we look at the next best option, which is Item 3 at 63.

Now, let's check if this allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3, which is the highest available valued item for them after Agent 1 takes Item 0.

Now, we have allocated 3 items. We still need to allocate one more item, Item 1. Since this item has the lowest valuations across agents, and to ensure fairness and completeness, we assign Item 1 to Agent 0, who has a second-highest valuation for an unallocated item.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation is fairly balanced considering the constraints, and each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
