Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  73  42  51
1  76  39  43   7
2  74  91  44  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents such that envy is minimized, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations, we want to allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent.

Let's summarize the problem:
- We have 3 agents (0, 1, 2).
- We have 4 items (0, 1, 2, 3).
- The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a whole number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here are the valuations given:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 56     | 73     | 42     | 51     |
| 1     | 76     | 39     | 43     | 7      |
| 2     | 74     | 91     | 44     | 91     |

Consider the following allocation strategy:
- Allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and attempting to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's allocate the items as follows:
- Agent 2 values Item 1 and Item 3 highly, so assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest, so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values Item 2 relatively well, and it is not highly valued by others, so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Now, for Item 3, Agent 2 also values it highly, so let's assign it to Agent 2.

This allocation is:
- Agent 0 gets Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value relatively highly.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
