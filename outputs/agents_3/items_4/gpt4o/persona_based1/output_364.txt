Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  31   3   4  98
1  39  93  64  13
2   8  83  28  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can use the concept of envy-freeness to guide our allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocated bundle over their own.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize fairness:

- Agent 0: Valuations = [31, 3, 4, 98]
- Agent 1: Valuations = [39, 93, 64, 13]
- Agent 2: Valuations = [8, 83, 28, 13]

Let's allocate based on the highest values each agent has for different items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (value of 98), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value of 93), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly as well (value of 83), but it has already been allocated. Next, Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value of 28), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Items left to allocate: Item 0. Agent 1 values item 0 higher (value of 39) compared to Agent 2 (value of 8), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has received one item, and all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
