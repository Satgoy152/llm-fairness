Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  49  32  43
1  11  10  62   6
2  10  94  17  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values it. Given the valuations, we can use a method like the Maximum Envy-Free Allocation strategy to ensure fairness.

Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:** 
   - Item 0: 93
   - Item 1: 49
   - Item 2: 32
   - Item 3: 43

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 11
   - Item 1: 10
   - Item 2: 62
   - Item 3: 6

3. **Agent 2 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 10
   - Item 1: 94
   - Item 2: 17
   - Item 3: 60

### Allocation Approach:

- **Item 0:** Highly valued by Agent 0 (93). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Highly valued by Agent 2 (94). Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 2:** Highly valued by Agent 1 (62). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Remaining item, best allocated to Agent 2 (60), as it provides a high value to them.

### Final Allocation:

The allocation provides each agent with a set of items such that their total valuation is relatively high compared to what they would value the items allocated to other agents.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution tries to minimize envy by allocating items according to the highest individual valuations.
