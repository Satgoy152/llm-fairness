Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  92  46  38
1  50  12  56  23
2  55  84   4  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness among the three agents (0, 1, 2) for the four items (0, 1, 2, 3), we need to consider their valuations and try to minimize envy. One common approach to achieve this is using the "Envy-Free" criterion, where each agent should feel they received at least as much value as any other agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step consideration:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Item 0: 91
   - Item 1: 92
   - Item 2: 46
   - Item 3: 38

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: 
   - Item 0: 50
   - Item 1: 12
   - Item 2: 56
   - Item 3: 23

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: 
   - Item 0: 55
   - Item 1: 84
   - Item 2: 4
   - Item 3: 36

Let's allocate the items to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 1. Giving agent 0 both items 0 and 1 maximizes their satisfaction (91 + 92 = 183).
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the most. Allocating item 2 to agent 1 gives them a value of 56.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most after items 0 and 1, which have already been allocated. Allocating item 3 to agent 2 gives them a value of 36.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's total value from their most preferred available items, thereby minimizing envy.

Now, the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
