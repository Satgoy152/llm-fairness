Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  97  88  44
1  23  63  51  90
2  51  53  39  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 63 51 90]
 [51 53 39 83]]
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 4 items among the 3 agents such that the allocation is fair and envy-free as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their own valuations.

First, let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3
Agent 0: 15  97  88  44
Agent 1: 23  63  51  90
Agent 2: 51  53  39  83
```

We will attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation and minimizes envy. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (97). We assign item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (90). We assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (51). We assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item (2)**: Now, item 2 remains unallocated. We need to allocate it to one of the agents to complete the allocation. We assign it to the agent who derives the highest value from it, which is agent 0 (88).

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 2], with a total valuation of 97 + 88 = 185.
- Agent 1 has item [3], with a total valuation of 90.
- Agent 2 has item [0], with a total valuation of 51.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction according to their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the distribution remains integer. 

Now, present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
