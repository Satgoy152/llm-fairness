Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  26  82  47
1  99  45  45  82
2  14  29  37  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, which involves trying to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with the items they receive, given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [86, 26, 82, 47]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [99, 45, 45, 82]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [14, 29, 37, 31]

To allocate fairly, we should aim to give items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair portion of the total value.

One potential allocation that attempts to minimize envy and ensures all items are distributed is:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 99)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 29)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 82)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 47)

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, with a total value of 129.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, with a total value of 99.
- Agent 2 receives item 1, with a total value of 29.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to be as fair as possible given the agents' valuations.
