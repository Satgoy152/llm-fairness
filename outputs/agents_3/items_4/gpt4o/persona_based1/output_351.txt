Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  27  81  57
1   5  63  51  34
2  99  28  10  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute them in a way that maximizes fairness. The goal is to ensure that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Item 0: 85
   - Item 2: 81
   - Item 3: 57
   - Item 1: 27

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Item 1: 63
   - Item 2: 51
   - Item 3: 34
   - Item 0: 5

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - Item 0: 99
   - Item 1: 28
   - Item 3: 28
   - Item 2: 10

By examining the agents' preferences, we can try to allocate the items so each agent receives the highest possible value without causing significant envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 2** highly values Item 0 the most, so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 1** highly values Item 1, so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values Item 2 highly, so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 0** also values Item 3 more than the others do, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation tries to maximize the individual satisfaction of the agents based on their highest-valued items.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

This allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints, as each agent gets at least one of their most valued items.
