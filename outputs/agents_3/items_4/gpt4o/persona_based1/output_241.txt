Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  44  67  20
1  87  49   8  90
2  88  60  35  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, while considering their valuations. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent maximizes their perceived value.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [31, 44, 67, 20]
- Agent 1 values: [87, 49, 8, 90]
- Agent 2 values: [88, 60, 35, 31]

We will prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, while ensuring no agent is left without a fair share. Let's proceed step by step:

1. Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 88. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 90. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. For Agent 0, the highest remaining valued item is item 2 at 67. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. The remaining item is 1, which has not been assigned yet. Agent 2 values item 1 the most among the remaining choices, at 60. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the items as per this analysis:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
