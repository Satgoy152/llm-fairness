Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  75  49  44
1  39  88  47  29
2  22  41  21  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by allocating items such that each agent perceives their share as fair relative to the others. We'll use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives from their allocated items.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as [63, 75, 49, 44].
- Agent 1 values the items as [39, 88, 47, 29].
- Agent 2 values the items as [22, 41, 21, 32].

We can start by assigning the highest-valued items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an item they value highly if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 1**: The highest value is 88 by Agent 1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0**: Next highest value is 75 by Agent 0. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 0 and Agent 2 have close valuations, but Agent 0 has already received Item 0. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 2**: Remaining item. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, who values it higher than Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, aiming to minimize envy by giving each agent one of their more highly valued items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

Each agent is included in the JSON output, and all 4 items are allocated.
