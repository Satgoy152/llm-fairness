Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  37  65  26
1  60  66  83  81
2  14  87  77  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. This means each agent should receive items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own, based on their individual valuations. Given the valuations, we can attempt to make an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [94, 37, 65, 26]
- Agent 1: [60, 66, 83, 81]
- Agent 2: [14, 87, 77, 41]

A possible fair allocation is:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it second highest, and it maximizes the total value for Agent 1.

This allocation results in the following values for each agent:
- Agent 0: 94 (Item 0)
- Agent 1: 83 + 81 = 164 (Items 2 and 3)
- Agent 2: 87 (Item 1)

This allocation tries to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value relatively highly and tries to balance the total values as fairly as possible.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
