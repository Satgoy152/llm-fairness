Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  50  13  64
1  21  41  91  51
2  15  21  83  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we will first consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy. 

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Identify highest valuations**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most. This will help us make allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction.

2. **Initial allocation**: Attempt to allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that no agent receives more than two items initially.

3. **Adjust for fairness**: Check if any adjustments are needed to achieve a more balanced and envy-free allocation.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (64), followed by item 1 (50), item 0 (33), and item 2 (13).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (91), followed by item 3 (51), item 1 (41), and item 0 (21).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97), followed by item 2 (83), item 1 (21), and item 0 (15).

Given these valuations, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (50) to Agent 0. This is one of the highest valued items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (91) to Agent 1. This item is highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (97) to Agent 2. This item is the highest valued by Agent 2.
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (33) to Agent 0. This balances out the allocation by giving Agent 0 two items, which they value.

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting at least one of their most valued items and helps achieve a fair distribution.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
