Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  65   0   0  49
1  56  54  15   0
2  45  14  58  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [45 14 58 95]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 65 and item 3 at 49.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 56, item 1 at 54, and item 2 at 15.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 45, item 1 at 14, item 2 at 58, and item 3 at 95.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Assign item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (95), which maximizes their utility.
2. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (65) compared to other items they value.
3. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 15, and other items have higher valuations from other agents.
4. **Assign item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (54).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Checking for envy-freeness:

- Agent 0: Values their allocation at 65, which is the highest value they can achieve given the other allocations.
- Agent 1: Values their allocation at 54 + 15 = 69, which is the highest value they can achieve given the other allocations.
- Agent 2: Values their allocation at 95, which is the highest value they can achieve given the other allocations.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints.

Allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
