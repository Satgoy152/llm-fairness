Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  94  61  16  61
1  28  44   6  96
2  97  46  68  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of items of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 94  
  - Item 1: 61  
  - Item 2: 16  
  - Item 3: 61  

- Agent 1 values:  
  - Item 0: 28  
  - Item 1: 44  
  - Item 2: 6  
  - Item 3: 96  

- Agent 2 values:  
  - Item 0: 97  
  - Item 1: 46  
  - Item 2: 68  
  - Item 3: 63  

To achieve an allocation that is likely to be envy-free, we should aim to give each agent the items they value highly.

One possible allocation strategy is as follows:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly at 61, and it is their second-highest value.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it completes their allocation and minimizes envy, given the remaining items.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
