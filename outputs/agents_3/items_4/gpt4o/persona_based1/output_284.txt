Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  59  89  32
1  33  45  73  52
2  16  96   5   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum utility. In this case, we will try to allocate items in a way that each agent is satisfied with their own allocation, given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [72, 59, 89, 32]
- Agent 1: [33, 45, 73, 52]
- Agent 2: [16, 96, 5, 9]

A possible way to allocate the items is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to do it:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (72), so assign it to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (96), so assign it to Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (89), so assign it to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (52), so assign it to Agent 1.

By this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, thus maintaining a sense of fairness.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
