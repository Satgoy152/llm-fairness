Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  71  74  74
1  97  59  51  10
2  36  65  88  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness (or minimizing envy when perfect envy-freeness isn't possible), we consider the agents' valuations of each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items in a way that balances their perceived value.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 4, 71, 74, 74
- Agent 1: 97, 59, 51, 10
- Agent 2: 36, 65, 88, 88

A straightforward approach is to start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item if possible, while ensuring each item is only assigned once and each agent gets at least one item. We can then adjust to maintain a fair division.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Assign each agent their highest-valued item (if there are no conflicts):**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 and 3 equally at 74.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 97.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 and 3 equally at 88.

   Initial potential allocation:
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (highest value 97).
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (one of the highest values 88).
   - Agent 0 can get item 3 (also valued at 74).

2. **Resolve conflicts and check remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value item 2 highly, but Agent 2 has already been assigned item 2, so Agent 0 can take item 3.
   - Remaining item for allocation is item 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining item (1) based on secondary preferences:**
   - Item 1 is valued as follows: Agent 0 (71), Agent 1 (59), Agent 2 (65).
   - The highest secondary value for item 1 is by Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the choice is made to maximize individual valuations, thereby minimizing potential envy.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation is balanced, considering the valuations, and attempts to reduce potential envy among the agents.
