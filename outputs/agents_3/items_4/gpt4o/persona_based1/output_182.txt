Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  10  63  17
1   3  92  19  41
2  90  78  23  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction relative to their valuations. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation approach:

**Valuations Table:**
- Agent 0: [31, 10, 63, 17]
- Agent 1: [3, 92, 19, 41]
- Agent 2: [90, 78, 23, 47]

**Strategy:**
1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total perceived value while considering the overall fairness.

**Total Value by Agent:**
- Agent 0: 31 + 10 + 63 + 17 = 121
- Agent 1: 3 + 92 + 19 + 41 = 155
- Agent 2: 90 + 78 + 23 + 47 = 238

**Allocation Plan:**
- Assign the highest valued item to each agent in a way that balances their total perceived value.

**Proposed Allocation:**
1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value item for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value item for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value item for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value item for Agent 1).

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total value of 63.
- Agent 1 a total value of 92 + 41 = 133.
- Agent 2 a total value of 90.

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while distributing the items fairly, considering their preferences.
