Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  89  29  43
1  95  34  76  75
2  37  72  54  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives or ensuring no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we aim to distribute the items in a way that respects these principles.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [42, 89, 29, 43]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [95, 34, 76, 75]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [37, 72, 54, 45]

One approach to achieving envy-freeness is to allocate items based on what each agent values most, provided that it doesn't create envy. We can also use the concept of maximizing Nash welfare, which involves maximizing the product of utilities.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (value 89)
   - Second highest value: Item 3 (value 43)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (value 95)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 54)

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3]
- Agent 1 gets item [0]
- Agent 2 gets item [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their most valued available item, and each agent receives an integer number of items. This distribution minimizes envy as each agent gets a high-value item according to their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
