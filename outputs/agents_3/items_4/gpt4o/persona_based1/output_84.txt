Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  91  23  18
1  58  50   8  37
2  15   9  75  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 50  8 37]
 [15  9 75 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations matrix:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [12, 91, 23, 18]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [58, 50, 8, 37]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [15, 9, 75, 44]

We must allocate exactly 4 items total, each item to one agent.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Approach:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This often helps in minimizing envy.

2. **Assignment:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 58.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it second highest at 44 (Agent 0 values it at 18, which is less than Agent 2's valuation).

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 1, which they value at 91, their highest valuation.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0, which they value at 58, their highest valuation for that item.
   - Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3, valuing them at 75 and 44, respectively, their highest combined valuation.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives at least one item they highly value.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This solution ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent is considered in the allocation process.
