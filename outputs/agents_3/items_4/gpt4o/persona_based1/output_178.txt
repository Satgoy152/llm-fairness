Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  67  95  79
1  92  72  57  12
2  13   9  48  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating items to agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Our goal is to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the scenario:

- Agent 0's valuations: [97, 67, 95, 79]
- Agent 1's valuations: [92, 72, 57, 12]
- Agent 2's valuations: [13, 9, 48, 86]

First, we can consider how to allocate the items to minimize envy. We should try to assign the most valued items to different agents as much as possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (97) and item 2 (95). We can assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (72) and item 0 (92). Since item 0 is already assigned to Agent 0, we can assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (86). We can assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. The remaining item, item 2, can be assigned to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly (95), and it balances the distribution.

This allocation aims to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their highest valued items. It also ensures that each agent receives at least one item, except Agent 2 in this case will not receive an additional item due to the constraints.

Letâ€™s present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This distribution attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent one of their higher-valued items.
