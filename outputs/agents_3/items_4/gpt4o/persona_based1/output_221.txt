Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  48  38  91
1  18  16  36  50
2  77  89  41  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a systematic approach. One method is to use the "sequential picking" approach, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item. 

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (91), so they pick item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest remaining value on item 2 (36), so they pick item 2.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest remaining value on item 1 (89), so they pick item 1.
4. Finally, item 0 is left, and **Agent 0** has the highest remaining value on it (88), so they pick item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting their most preferred available item in each step, thus maintaining a fair distribution as much as possible within the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and attempts to minimize envy by allowing agents to pick their most valued item sequentially.
