Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  71  33   2
1  58  32  34  68
2  87  71   4  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, given their individual valuations.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 75. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: For Agent 1, item 3 has the highest value at 68. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 at 4, which is lower compared to their valuations of other items. However, for a fair allocation, we need to manage the remaining items. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Remaining Item**: Item 1 is valued highest by both agents 0 and 2, but since agent 2 has been allocated item 2, assign item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution minimizes potential envy based on the given valuations.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
