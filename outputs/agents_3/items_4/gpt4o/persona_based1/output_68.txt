Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  23  46  86
1   1  28   6  89
2  90  68  95  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. A possible approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using an envy-free mechanism like the "Envy-Free up to One Good (EF1)" allocation. In this context, we aim to allocate items in such a way that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own once a single item is removed from the other agent's bundle.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

### Step 1: Identify Preferences
- Agent 0's highest valuated item: Item 3 (86)
- Agent 1's highest valuated item: Item 3 (89), Item 1 (28)
- Agent 2's highest valuated item: Item 2 (95), Item 0 (90)

### Step 2: Initial Allocation Proposal
Given the preference and value-based approach, we can start with:
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (since it's their highest value and highly valued by Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2, but Agent 0 also values this).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (moderate value for Agent 0).

### Step 3: Evaluation
- Agent 0: [1] -> Total Value: 23
- Agent 1: [3] -> Total Value: 89
- Agent 2: [0, 2] -> Total Value: 185

This allocation gives a significant value to each agent based on their preferences, and it's approximately envy-free since no agent would strictly prefer another's allocation over theirs when considering the removal of one item from the other's allocation.

Given these considerations, the allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, respects the agents' preferences, and aims for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
