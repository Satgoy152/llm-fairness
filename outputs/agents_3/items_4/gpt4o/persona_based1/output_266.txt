Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  33  96  12
1  21   9   6  19
2  23  79  97  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the valuations from each agent:

- Agent 0: [60, 33, 96, 12]
- Agent 1: [21, 9, 6, 19]
- Agent 2: [23, 79, 97, 15]

Given these valuations, a potential envy-free allocation is:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0. This item is highly valued by Agent 0 (value of 60) and not as highly valued by other agents.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2. This item is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 79).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This item is highly valued by Agent 0 (value of 96) and is the highest valued item overall.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. Although Agent 1's valuations are generally lower, item 3 is the highest valued item for them (value of 19).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to satisfy each agent's highest preference for an item they can reasonably get, given the constraints. It also aims to minimize envy as much as possible within the constraints of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
