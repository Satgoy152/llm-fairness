Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  63  26   2
1  78  43  62  33
2  72  38   1  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the three agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use the method of "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1), which allows for allocations that may not be perfectly envy-free but are close to it.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [21, 63, 26, 2]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [78, 43, 62, 33]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [72, 38, 1, 49]

One potential allocation that attempts to minimize envy could be:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Let's verify the allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets item 2 with valuation 26.
- **Agent 1** gets item 0 with valuation 78.
- **Agent 2** gets items 1 and 3 with total valuation 38 + 49 = 87.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations among the agents:

- Agent 0: 26
- Agent 1: 78
- Agent 2: 87

While this allocation is not perfectly envy-free, it tries to minimize the difference in perceived value among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
