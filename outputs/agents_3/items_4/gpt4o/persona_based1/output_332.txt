Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  81  95  63
1  93  80  88  81
2  82  94  64  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify each agent's highest valued items**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (94).

2. **Assign the highest-valued items to each agent as a starting point**: 
   - Agent 0 gets item 2,
   - Agent 1 gets item 0,
   - Agent 2 gets item 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining item**:
   - The remaining item is item 3. We need to allocate this item to minimize envy.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 63, Agent 1 values it at 81, and Agent 2 values it at 69.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3. Assigning item 3 to Agent 1 will minimize envy.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
