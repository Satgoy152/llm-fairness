Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  23   0  97  95
1  33  49  31  14
2  41  96  79  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and respects the integer constraint on the number of items each agent receives.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [23, 0, 97, 95]
Agent 1: [33, 49, 31, 14]
Agent 2: [41, 96, 79, 73]
```

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. We can break ties by considering the overall distribution of items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Item 0**: Valuation by agent 2 is the highest at 41.
2. **Item 1**: Valuation by agent 2 is the highest at 96.
3. **Item 2**: Valuation by agent 0 is the highest at 97.
4. **Item 3**: Valuation by agent 0 is the highest at 95.

However, this allocation would leave agent 1 without any items. To ensure each agent receives at least one item, we can make adjustments:

1. **Item 0**: Allocate to agent 1 (33), since agent 2 already has item 1.
2. **Item 1**: Allocate to agent 2 (96).
3. **Item 2**: Allocate to agent 0 (97).
4. **Item 3**: Allocate to agent 0 (95).

This ensures agent 1 receives at least one item. Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3].
- Agent 1 receives item [0].
- Agent 2 receives item [1].

This allocation is envy-minimizing given the constraints, as each agent receives an item they highly value, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
