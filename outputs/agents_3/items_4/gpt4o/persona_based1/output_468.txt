Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  59  67   2
1  23  87  32  79
2  95  72  23  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, I will use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as with any other agent's allocation, given their valuations.

The agents and their valuations for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: [59, 59, 67, 2]
- Agent 1: [23, 87, 32, 79]
- Agent 2: [95, 72, 23, 53]

We need to allocate 4 items among these 3 agents. Here is a possible allocation that seems envy-free:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. (Valuation: 67)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. (Valuation: 87)
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2. (Valuation: 95)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. (Valuation: 79)

This allocation can be justified as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 2, which is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, both of which have high valuations for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 0, which is their highest-valued item.

Each agent receives at least one of their highest-valued items, which helps ensure that they are not envious of other agents' allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
