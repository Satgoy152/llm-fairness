Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  96  76  78
1  53  17  31  11
2  19  83  39  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation or a balanced approach where agents have similar total values for their allocated items.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  23  96  76  78
1  53  17  31  11
2  19  83  39  51
```

One method to achieve a fair division is to calculate the total value each agent places on each item and then assign items such that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's try an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 1 (96). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 0 (53). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3 (51). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Remaining item (2)**: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 31, and Agent 2 at 39. To balance the overall allocation, we should consider the total values so far and allocate item 2 to Agent 0, because it maximizes their utility and balances total allocations.

Now let's check the total values each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2 -> 96 + 76 = 172
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 -> 53
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 -> 51

This allocation provides Agent 0 with more value, but considering their high valuation for item 1 and the necessity to allocate all items, this is a reasonable allocation strategy given the constraints. It's challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness with only 4 items for 3 agents, but this method aims to maximize the total perceived value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
