Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  93  68  98
1   8  79  26  81
2  74  37  65  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible. Since we are dealing with integers, each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all four items must be allocated.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 (99) and item 3 (98) very highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 (79) and item 3 (81) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (74) and item 2 (65) highly.

A possible allocation strategy could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values this item the most.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values this item the most.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values this item highly and Agent 0 has received the least so far.

This allocation maximizes each agent's valuation of the items they receive and is fair in the sense that it respects the highest preferences of each agent.

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
