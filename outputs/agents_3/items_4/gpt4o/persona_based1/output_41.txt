Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  61  28  94
1  35  39  76  43
2  99  97  48  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items based on their valuations. This often involves finding a way to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's bundle of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: values items [44, 61, 28, 94]
- Agent 1: values items [35, 39, 76, 43]
- Agent 2: values items [99, 97, 48, 20]

A potential solution to ensure fairness is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total value from their assigned items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign item 3** to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (94).
2. **Assign item 2** to Agent 1, as they value it significantly (76).
3. **Assign item 0** to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (99).
4. **Assign item 1** to Agent 2, as they also value it highly (97).

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 2
- Agent 2: items 0 and 1

This allocation maximizes the individual satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
