Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  57  97  69
1  48  63  76  40
2  49  94  71  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [91, 57, 97, 69]
- Agent 1 values: [48, 63, 76, 40]
- Agent 2 values: [49, 94, 71, 19]

A potential envy-free allocation can be achieved by considering the highest valuations for each item and ensuring that agents are content with their allocation. Here's one way to allocate items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values this the most at 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values this the most at 94.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values this the most at 97.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values this the most at 40.

This leads to the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.

This allocation is chosen to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items, and it ensures envy-freeness because each agent gets at least one of their more highly valued items. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
