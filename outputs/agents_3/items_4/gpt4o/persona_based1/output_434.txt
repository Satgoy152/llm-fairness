Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  50  45  17
1  73  49  60  85
2  23   0  72  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we can use the following approach to ensure an equitable distribution:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: Item 0 (87), Item 1 (50), Item 2 (45), Item 3 (17)
   - Highest value: Item 0 (87)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: Item 0 (73), Item 1 (49), Item 2 (60), Item 3 (85)
   - Highest value: Item 3 (85)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: Item 0 (23), Item 1 (0), Item 2 (72), Item 3 (92)
   - Highest value: Item 3 (92)

To minimize envy, we should allocate the most valued items to the respective agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an item or items according to their preferences and the overall constraints.

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (87).
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item the highest (92).
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item as a second choice but still fairly high (60).
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: This is a compromise to ensure Agent 0 gets a fair share, given their next highest valuation after Item 0 (50).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is relatively fair based on the given valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
