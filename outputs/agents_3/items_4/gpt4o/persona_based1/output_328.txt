Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  82   7  64
1  65  26  20  24
2  64  40   4  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we can use a maximin or envy-free approach. However, considering the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items, we aim to find an allocation where each agent's valuation of their received items is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [64, 82, 7, 64]
- Agent 1 values items as: [65, 26, 20, 24]
- Agent 2 values items as: [64, 40, 4, 86]

A possible fair allocation would be:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it has the highest value (82).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it has the highest value (65) for them.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has the highest value (86).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as it has remaining value (20), and agent 1 has already received one item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the value each agent receives, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
