Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  81   7  66
1  91  89  13  71
2  42  34  95  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can apply concepts from fair division, such as maximizing total welfare or ensuring envy-freeness. We will try to minimize envy by giving items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0 at 81
  - 1 at 81
  - 2 at 7
  - 3 at 66

- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0 at 91
  - 1 at 89
  - 2 at 13
  - 3 at 71

- Agent 2 values items:
  - 0 at 42
  - 1 at 34
  - 2 at 95
  - 3 at 20

To minimize envy, we can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 89.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest at 71.

However, this allocation gives all items to Agent 1, which is not acceptable as we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item. Let's adjust the allocation to distribute the items more evenly while still considering strong preferences:

- Give Item 2 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest.
- Give Item 0 to Agent 1, who values it higher than the others.
- Give Item 1 to Agent 0 to diversify the allocation.

Now, we still have Item 3, which Agent 1 values highest, but Agent 0 also has a high valuation for it at 66. Since Agent 1 already has Item 0 and we want to diversify the allocation, we can give Item 3 to Agent 0.

Let's distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation respects the high valuations and ensures each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
