Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  21  73  21
1  24  58  53   1
2  45   9  98  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

### Step-by-step process:

1. **Agent Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [97, 21, 73, 21]
   - Agent 1: [24, 58, 53, 1]
   - Agent 2: [45, 9, 98, 64]

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (58).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (98).

3. **Initial High-Value Item Assignment:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items and Consideration:**
   - Remaining item: 3.
   - Valuations for item 3: 
     - Agent 0: 21
     - Agent 1: 1
     - Agent 2: 64

   Agent 2 values the remaining item the most (64).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation takes into account each agent's highest valuation items and the remaining item is given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair division as per the envy-free criterion.

### Allocations in JSON format:

{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
