Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  84  63  92  45
1  87  18  94  27
2  34  78  14  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims for fairness and aims to be envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations. We'll attempt to assign items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, if possible. Here's the table of valuations again for reference:

```
Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3
-------------|----|----|----|---
0            | 84 | 63 | 92 | 45
1            | 87 | 18 | 94 | 27
2            | 34 | 78 | 14 | 61
```

Given these valuations, let's try to allocate the items to maximize the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest value items: 2 (92), 0 (84), 1 (63), 3 (45)
2. **Agent 1**'s highest value items: 2 (94), 0 (87), 3 (27), 1 (18)
3. **Agent 2**'s highest value items: 1 (78), 3 (61), 0 (34), 2 (14)

From this, we can try to allocate the items to balance perceived fairness:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0 and highest remaining after 2 is taken).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0, ensuring all items are allocated).

This allocation maximizes the value each agent receives based on their highest priorities and distributes the items in a way that minimizes envy, given the constraints of the problem.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
