Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  63  64  43
1  57  13  14   5
2  48  11  50  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to it as possible, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the situation:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 43

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 14
  - Item 3: 5

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 50
  - Item 3: 90

A possible envy-free solution is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as balanced as possible across agents. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 receives item 1.
2. Agent 1 receives item 0.
3. Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3.

Valuations for this allocation:
- Agent 0: 63 (item 1)
- Agent 1: 57 (item 0)
- Agent 2: 140 (items 2 and 3)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 4. This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent the most valued items available to them under the constraints.
