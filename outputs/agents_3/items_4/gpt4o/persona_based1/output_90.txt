Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  97  22  77
1  85   4  99  97
2   6  46  94  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible given the valuations provided. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. **List Agents' Valuations for Each Item:**

   | Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 |
   |------|---------|---------|---------|
   | 0    | 85      | 85      | 6       |
   | 1    | 97      | 4       | 46      |
   | 2    | 22      | 99      | 94      |
   | 3    | 77      | 97      | 37      |

2. **Consider Each Agent's Top Choices:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 most (97), then Item 0 (85), Item 3 (77), and Item 2 (22).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 most (99), then Item 3 (97), Item 0 (85), and Item 1 (4).
   - Agent 2 values Item 2 most (94), then Item 1 (46), Item 3 (37), and Item 0 (6).

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Top Choices:**
   - Let's try to allocate each agent their most valued item or the best possible remaining option:
     - Agent 0: Allocate Item 1 (97) to Agent 0.
     - Agent 1: Allocate Item 2 (99) to Agent 1.
     - Agent 2: Allocate Item 3 (37) to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items and Adjustments:**
   - Item 0 (valued 85 by both Agent 0 and Agent 1) is left.
   - To minimize envy, allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values Item 1 (97) highly and already has it. This allocation is less likely to cause envy from Agent 1, who values Item 2 (99) the most and has it.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 0.
   - Agent 1: Item 2.
   - Agent 2: Item 3.

This allocation results in each agent getting items based on their preferences while minimizing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
