Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  43  12  29
1  10  76   6  52
2   8  22  56  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as efficient as possible. Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (20), Item 1 (43), Item 2 (12), Item 3 (29)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (10), Item 1 (76), Item 2 (6), Item 3 (52)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (8), Item 1 (22), Item 2 (56), Item 3 (38)

One of the strategies to achieve an envy-free allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring no agent feels another has a better allocation. Given the constraints, here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it the highest (76), and this item has the highest value for any agent.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 because they value it the highest (56), and this item has the highest value for them.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because they have a reasonably high valuation for it (29) compared to the other available items.
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because it complements their allocation and they value it more than Agent 2.

This gives us the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by matching each agent with items they value highly within the constraints. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
