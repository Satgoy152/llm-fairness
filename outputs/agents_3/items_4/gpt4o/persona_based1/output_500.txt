Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  99  29  18
1  76   1  25  92
2  64  86  92  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [64 86 92 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means each agent prefers their own allocation over others or values them equally.

Let's first outline the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 63, Item 1 at 99, Item 2 at 29, Item 3 at 18
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 76, Item 1 at 1, Item 2 at 25, Item 3 at 92
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 at 64, Item 1 at 86, Item 2 at 92, Item 3 at 85

We should try to assign items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 2:**
   - Values Item 2 the highest among all items (92). Let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values Item 3 the highest (92). Let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0:**
   - Left with Items 0 and 1. Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (99). Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 0 is left. Agent 1 values Item 0 at 76, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation of 64. However, Agent 0 values it at 63. Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 to balance Agent 1's allocation.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives Item 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
