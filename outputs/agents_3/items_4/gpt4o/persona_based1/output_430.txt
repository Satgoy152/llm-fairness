Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  15  49  93
1  25  47  40  57
2  80  82  21  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 47 40 57]
 [80 82 21 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to balance the total value each agent receives from their assigned items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [93, 15, 49, 93]
- Agent 1 values: [25, 47, 40, 57]
- Agent 2 values: [80, 82, 21, 25]

Let's attempt to allocate items in a way that is fair and minimizes envy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest (93), so we allocate it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest (82), so we allocate it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest (40), so we allocate it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest (93), so we allocate it to Agent 0.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, Agent 1 receives item 2, and Agent 2 receives item 1. This allocation balances the total perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
