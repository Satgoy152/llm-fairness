Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  74  93  57
1  11   2  34  57
2  36  15  45  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to use a method that considers the preferences of the agents while also ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. We analyze the valuations provided and use them to allocate items in a manner that attempts to maximize fairness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (93).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (57).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (60).

2. **Assign High-Valuation Items:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valuation across all agents for any item.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it slightly higher than Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 0 and Item 1 are left to be allocated.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it more (36) compared to Agent 0 (15) and Agent 1 (11).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (74), and it gives Agent 0 a good share of value.

### Allocation Summary:
- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3

This allocation gives each agent an allocation that attempts to balance their valuations fairly, while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
