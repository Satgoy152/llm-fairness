Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  41  98  77
1  61  78   1   8
2  47  47   7  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 41 98 77]
 [61 78  1  8]
 [47 47  7 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations and achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as [60, 41, 98, 77]
- Agent 1 values the items as [61, 78, 1, 8]
- Agent 2 values the items as [47, 47, 7, 18]

Let's analyze the optimal allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Prefers item 2 the most (value of 98).
   - Next highest valued item is item 3 (value of 77).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers item 1 the most (value of 78).
   - Next highest valued item is item 0 (value of 61).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values both items 0 and 1 equally (value of 47).
   - Next highest valued item is item 3 (value of 18).

An allocation that considers these preferences and ensures envy-freeness is:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (highest preference).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (highest preference).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (shared highest preference with item 1, but item 1 is taken by Agent 1).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (item 3):

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 2, which is highly valued.
- **Agent 1**: Least value for item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 as it is the next highest valued item after item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocations are envy-free given the agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
