Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  84  83  68
1  51  23  42  78
2  65  91   8  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize their satisfaction. The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and no agent envies another agent's allocation given their valuations.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - The highest value items for Agent 0 are:
     - Item 1: 84
     - Item 2: 83
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - The highest value items for Agent 1 are:
     - Item 3: 78
     - Item 0: 51
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - The highest value items for Agent 2 are:
     - Item 1: 91
     - Item 3: 90
     - Item 0: 65
   - Since Item 1 is already allocated, allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining items:**
   - Item 2 is left, with the following valuations:
     - Agent 0: 83
     - Agent 1: 42
     - Agent 2: 8
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it higher than the other agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and is as satisfied as possible given the constraints. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
