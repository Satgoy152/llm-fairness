Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  35  50  72
1  99  93  74  69
2  50  13  62  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can leverage the valuations provided in the table. A common approach is to use the max-min fairness criterion, attempting to maximize the minimum satisfaction among the agents. However, given the discrete nature of items and the specific valuations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible. Nonetheless, we will aim for a fair allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 99, and Agent 2 at 50.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 93, and Agent 2 at 13.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 74, and Agent 2 at 62.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 69, and Agent 2 at 32.

To maximize the total value perceived by each agent, let's make the following allocations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, who values it the highest (99).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, who values it the highest (93).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, who values it fairly high (62).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, who values it the highest (72).

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3, with a total perceived value of 72.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1, with a total perceived value of 192 (99 + 93).
- Agent 2 receives Item 2, with a total perceived value of 62.

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all four items are allocated. Though this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, it balances the valuations as fairly as possible under the circumstances.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
