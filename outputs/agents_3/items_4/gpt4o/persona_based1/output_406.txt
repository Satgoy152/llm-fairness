Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  83  44  34
1  36   7  34  58
2  13  10  84  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations and tries to maximize fairness. Given that we have three agents and four items, one possible approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (81), 1 (83), 2 (44), 3 (34)
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (36), 1 (7), 2 (34), 3 (58)
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (13), 1 (10), 2 (84), 3 (14)

A potential allocation could be:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because it gives the highest value to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 because it gives the highest value to Agent 2.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it gives the highest value to Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it gives the second highest value to Agent 0.

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations. It may not be perfectly envy-free, but it aims to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items according to their preferences as closely as possible.
