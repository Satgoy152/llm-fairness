Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  22   8  17  51
1  86  26  95  43
2  12  52  80  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate all 4 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [22, 8, 17, 51]
Agent 1: [86, 26, 95, 43]
Agent 2: [12, 52, 80, 58]
```

Let's follow these steps to reach an allocation:

1. **Maximize individual satisfaction**: Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, provided it does not conflict with others.

2. **Resolve conflicts**: If two agents have the highest value for the same item, examine alternative allocations that minimize envy.

3. **Check for envy-freeness**: Ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

### Allocation Process

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 1 values it the highest at 86.

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 2 values it the highest at 52.

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 1 values it the highest at 95, but Agent 2 also values it high at 80. Since Agent 1 has already received Item 0, we can allocate this to Agent 2 to balance their allocation.

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0 values it the highest at 51.

Now let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3 (value 51).
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 (value 86).
- Agent 2 receives Item 1 (value 52) and Item 2 (value 80).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly and is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation uses all the items and meets the requirement of integer item allocation while considering fairness and minimizing envy.
