Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  66  36  26
1   5  16  27  82
2  96  47  79  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating the items based on their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 19, 66, 36, 26
- Agent 1 values: 5, 16, 27, 82
- Agent 2 values: 96, 47, 79, 62

One approach to achieve a fair division is the "max-min" strategy, where we aim to maximize the minimum value an agent receives. We try to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their own valuation as much as possible without causing significant envy among agents.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now we have one item left (item 2) and need to allocate it to minimize envy:
- Agent 0's remaining highest valuation is for item 2 (36).
- Agent 1's remaining highest valuation is also for item 2 (27).
- Agent 2's remaining highest valuation is for item 2 (79).

Thus, item 2 should be allocated to Agent 2 to maximize their valuation and minimize envy, as Agent 2 values it the most.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item, and we minimize envy by considering their valuations.

{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
