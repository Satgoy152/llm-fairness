Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  79  10  23
1  37   7  27   3
2  11  27  37  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to examine how each agent values each item. Our goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations first:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 76, Item 1 at 79, Item 2 at 10, Item 3 at 23
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 37, Item 1 at 7, Item 2 at 27, Item 3 at 3
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 at 11, Item 1 at 27, Item 2 at 37, Item 3 at 48

We aim for an allocation where each agent is satisfied with their share given their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (79)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (37)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (48)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have one item left, Item 2, which needs to be allocated.

4. **Allocation of Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 10, Agent 1 values it at 27, and Agent 2 values it at 37.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for this item among the unallocated items.

### Resulting Allocation

- Agent 0 receives: [1]
- Agent 1 receives: [0]
- Agent 2 receives: [3, 2]

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while maintaining a fair distribution based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This solution ensures that each agent receives an allocation in line with their preferences, minimizing envy based on the given valuations.
