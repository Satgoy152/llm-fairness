Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  67  29  96
1  11  64  78   9
2  13  23  27  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and aim to minimize envy. A common approach to achieve fairness is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation method, which ensures that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent has received.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [15, 67, 29, 96]
Agent 1: [11, 64, 78, 9]
Agent 2: [13, 23, 27, 61]
```

We need to allocate the four items (numbered 0 to 3) to the three agents. Here is one possible solution that aims to balance the perceived value each agent gets while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

### Allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0: This gives Agent 0 the highest value, 96.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1: This gives Agent 1 the highest value, 78.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2: This is the second-highest value for Agent 2, 23.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2: This gives Agent 2 an additional item, with a value of 13.

### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them some of their highest-valued items and minimizes envy as much as possible given the valuations.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
