Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  99  96  94
1  33   9  34  94
2  49  52  60  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided by the agents, the goal is to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as favorable as possible based on their preferences.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 52, Item 1 = 99, Item 2 = 96, Item 3 = 94
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 33, Item 1 = 9,  Item 2 = 34, Item 3 = 94
- Agent 2: Item 0 = 49, Item 1 = 52, Item 2 = 60, Item 3 = 76

To achieve a fair distribution, we will:

1. Allocate the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the most, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values Item 3 the most, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values Item 2 the most, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, for the remaining Item 0, we can allocate it to Agent 0, since Agent 0 still has a high valuation for it compared to others.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item set that they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
