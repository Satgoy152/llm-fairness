Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  11  61  62
1  41  78   7  51
2   5  47  60  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 11 61 62]
 [41 78  7 51]
 [ 5 47 60 25]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as or better than the allocation of any other agent according to their own valuation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [59, 11, 61, 62]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [41, 78, 7, 51]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [5, 47, 60, 25]

We will try to allocate the items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

### Step 1: Identify the highest valued items for each agent
- Agent 0: Highest valued item is 3 (value 62)
- Agent 1: Highest valued item is 1 (value 78)
- Agent 2: Highest valued item is 2 (value 60)

### Step 2: Allocate these highest valued items to each respective agent
- Agent 0 gets item 3
- Agent 1 gets item 1
- Agent 2 gets item 2

### Step 3: Allocate the remaining item (item 0)
Now, item 0 is left to be allocated. Each agent values item 0 as follows:
- Agent 0: 59
- Agent 1: 41
- Agent 2: 5

Since Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent one of their highest valued items, and the remaining item to the agent who values it the most.

### JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
