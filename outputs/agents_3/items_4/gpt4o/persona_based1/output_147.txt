Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  15  60  59
1  21  70  54  55
2  81  55  44  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 15 60 59]
 [21 70 54 55]
 [81 55 44 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will strive to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to any other agent more than their own.

Given the valuations:

```
Agents \ Items:  0   1   2   3
Agent 0:         3  15  60  59
Agent 1:        21  70  54  55
Agent 2:        81  55  44  49
```

We need to consider each agent's preferences and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible.

### Valuation Analysis:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (60) and item 3 (59).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (70).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (81).

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the most (81).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (70).
3. Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0, as they have the highest combined valuation for these items (60 + 59 = 119).

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences and attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

This allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints, and it allocates all the items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
