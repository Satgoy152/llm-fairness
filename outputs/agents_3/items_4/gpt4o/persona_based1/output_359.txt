Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  58  24  87
1  35   0  46  62
2  83  15  46  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we will use the concept of maximizing total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations. Let's try to allocate items such that each agent gets a satisfactory share based on their valuations.

Here's the table again for reference:

```
        0   1   2   3
    0  73  58  24  87
    1  35   0  46  62
    2  83  15  46  27
```

We will analyze each agent's valuation and allocate items based on maximizing individual satisfaction and reducing envy as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations: [73, 58, 24, 87]
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (87).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations: [35, 0, 46, 62]
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (46).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations: [83, 15, 46, 27]
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (83).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have one item left to allocate (item 1).

- **Remaining Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 58.
  - Agent 1 values it at 0.
  - Agent 2 values it at 15.

Since Agent 0 values item 1 the highest and has not received it yet, we will allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent and aims to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while trying to minimize envy.
