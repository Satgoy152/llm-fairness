Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  67   6  76   7
1  75  91  94  94
2  39  76  79  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations given in the table:

- Agent 0 values: [67, 6, 76, 7]
- Agent 1 values: [75, 91, 94, 94]
- Agent 2 values: [39, 76, 79, 43]

We will attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while considering envy-freeness.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 1, 2, and 3. Given the constraint of whole items, we will prioritize giving them items where they have significantly higher valuations compared to others.

2. **Agent 0** highly values item 2, and **Agent 2** has a reasonable valuation of item 1.

3. We will aim to give each agent at least one item, if possible, to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 1**: Best valued by Agent 1 (91), but Agent 2 also values it (76). We will give this item to **Agent 2** to balance the allocations.

- **Item 2**: Best valued by Agent 1 (94), followed by Agent 0 (76). We will assign this item to **Agent 1** to maximize their satisfaction.

- **Item 3**: Equally valued by Agent 1 (94) and Agent 2 (43), but significantly more by Agent 1. We will assign this item to **Agent 1**.

- **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (75) but also significantly by Agent 0 (67). We will assign this item to **Agent 0**.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation fairly distributes the items among the agents based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy. Each agent receives an item they highly value, considering the constraints of the problem.
