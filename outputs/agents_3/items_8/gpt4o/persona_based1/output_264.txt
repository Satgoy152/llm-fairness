Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  76  87  85  39  28  43  23
1  26  37  12  60   7  31  28  78
2  20  31  69  22  87  17   8  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their own valuation while striving to maintain an equitable distribution based on the valuations. This approach, while not necessarily guaranteeing envy-freeness, seeks to allocate items in a manner that reflects each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Let's consider the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 50 + 76 + 87 + 85 + 39 + 28 + 43 + 23 = 431
- Agent 1: 26 + 37 + 12 + 60 + 7 + 31 + 28 + 78 = 279
- Agent 2: 20 + 31 + 69 + 22 + 87 + 17 + 8 + 28 = 282

Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should receive approximately 8/3 â‰ˆ 2.67 items. To distribute them fairly, we can allocate 3 items to two agents and 2 items to one agent.

A fair allocation attempt based on maximizing individual preferences could be:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2, let's allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 7, so we allocate item 7. Next, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest valued item for them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 4, so we allocate item 4. We also allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it is the next highest valued item for them.

Now we need to ensure each agent has a fair number of items:

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5 (total value: 50 + 76 + 28 = 154)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7 (total value: 60 + 78 = 138)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 6 (total value: 69 + 87 + 8 = 164)

This gives each agent a reasonable share of their highest-valued items based on their preferences.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
