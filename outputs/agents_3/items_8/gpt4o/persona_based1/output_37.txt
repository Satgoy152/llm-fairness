Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  12   6   0  89  29  62  15
1  26  18  25  95  27  24  55  44
2  21  31   9  80  44  34  13  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 18 25 95 27 24 55 44]
 [21 31  9 80 44 34 13 84]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to distribute items according to the valuations provided. In this case, we can try to allocate in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring every item is distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (95) and item 4 (89). 
   - Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (95).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7 (84).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values highest at 31.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values highest at 25.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values highest at 34.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values highest at 62.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 7, 1, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items aligned with their highest valuations while distributing all 8 items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [7, 1, 5]
}
```
