Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24   2  84  89  23  41   4  40
1  41  29  26  23  45  45  70  22
2  70  10  69  23  55   3  44  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 10 69 23 55  3 44 84]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents with respect to their valuations, we can try to achieve envy-freeness, which means that each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we can use a simple algorithm that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

The valuations matrix is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   24   |    2   |   84   |   89   |   23   |   41   |    4   |   40   |
|   1   |   41   |   29   |   26   |   23   |   45   |   45   |   70   |   22   |
|   2   |   70   |   10   |   69   |   23   |   55   |    3   |   44   |   84   |

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 89.
2. **Item 7:** Agent 2 values item 7 the most at 84.
3. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 70.
4. **Item 0:** Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 70.
5. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 84.
6. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 55.
7. **Item 5:** Agent 1 values item 5 the most at 45.
8. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 29.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 5, 1
- Agent 2: Items 7, 0, 4

These allocations ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and each item is allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
