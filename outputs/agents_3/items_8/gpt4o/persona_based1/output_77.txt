Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  56  72  70  88  81  83  10
1  69  97  63  13  62  26  48  31
2  70  27  21  63  37  36  37  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 56 72 70 88 81 83 10]
 [69 97 63 13 62 26 48 31]
 [70 27 21 63 37 36 37 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [52, 56, 72, 70, 88, 81, 83, 10]
   - Agent 1: [69, 97, 63, 13, 62, 26, 48, 31]
   - Agent 2: [70, 27, 21, 63, 37, 36, 37, 32]

2. **Total Valuation per Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 512
   - Agent 1: 409
   - Agent 2: 323

3. **Fair Allocation Strategy**: 
   - We aim to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation given their preferences, while ensuring that each has no envy towards others.

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Start with the highest valued items for each agent and ensure no overlap.
   - Allocate items iteratively, prioritizing the highest value available for each agent that hasn't yet been assigned.

**Allocation**:
- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (88), item 6 (83), and item 5 (81).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97), item 0 (69), and item 2 (63).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (70), but since it's crucial for Agent 1's satisfaction, we assign item 3 (63), item 7 (32), and item 5 (36).

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [2, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value highly, which helps maintain envy-freeness to a reasonable extent given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
