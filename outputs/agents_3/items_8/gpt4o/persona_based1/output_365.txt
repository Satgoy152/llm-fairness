Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  60  86  55  31  43  88  89
1  17   3   9  30  43  32   5  10
2  96  19  66  21  94  93  35  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 60 86 55 31 43 88 89]
 [17  3  9 30 43 32  5 10]
 [96 19 66 21 94 93 35 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent envies another's allocation based on their valuations. We'll use the valuations provided in the table to inform our decisions.

First, let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0 values: [91, 60, 86, 55, 31, 43, 88, 89]
- Agent 1 values: [17, 3, 9, 30, 43, 32, 5, 10]
- Agent 2 values: [96, 19, 66, 21, 94, 93, 35, 73]

A useful approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, which helps in achieving envy-freeness. However, we must also ensure each agent gets a fair number of items. With 3 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the other two receive 3 items each.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this the highest (96). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this the highest (60). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this the highest (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this the highest (55). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this the highest (94). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values this the highest (93). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values this the highest (88). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values this the highest (89). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

After these allocations, we find that Agent 0 has been assigned too many items. Let's re-evaluate and adjust to ensure fairness:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this the highest (96). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this the highest (60). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this the highest (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this the second highest (30) after Agent 0. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this the highest (94). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values this the highest (93). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values this the highest (88). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values this more than Agent 0 (10 vs 89), but to balance allocations, assign item 7 to Agent 1.

Now, the allocations are balanced:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 7
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 4, 5

These allocations are finalized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
