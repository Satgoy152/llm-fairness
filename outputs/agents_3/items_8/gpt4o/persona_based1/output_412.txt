Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  19  44  81  17  53  37  12
1  14  19  11  19  72  44  44  57
2  10   1  92  55  77  25  25  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 19 11 19 72 44 44 57]
 [10  1 92 55 77 25 25 73]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation, we should aim for a distribution where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocations of the other agents. However, given the constraint of distributing exactly 8 items, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be feasible. Instead, we aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [82, 19, 44, 81, 17, 53, 37, 12]
Agent 1: [14, 19, 11, 19, 72, 44, 44, 57]
Agent 2: [10, 1, 92, 55, 77, 25, 25, 73]
```

We will proceed by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item to start with:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (82)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (19)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (92)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (81)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (77)
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (53)
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (44)
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (73)

Now, distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4, 7]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 82 + 19 + 81 + 53 = 235
- Agent 1: 44
- Agent 2: 92 + 77 + 73 = 242

This allocation isn't perfect in terms of minimizing envy, but it provides a fair distribution of items based on the highest valuations. Agent 1 ends up with fewer items, but this is due to the constraints of maximizing individual valuations and the limited number of highly valued items for Agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
