Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  15  86   6  76  61  89   9
1  72  56  49  50  94  97  99  49
2   0  49  64  58  53  21  48   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. We'll try to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation, subject to the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.

One possible allocation strategy is to use a round-robin method based on the agents' highest valuations for the remaining items. Let's follow this approach:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Highest value: Item 6 (value 89)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (value 86)
   - Third highest: Item 4 (value 76)
  
2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Highest value: Item 6 (value 99)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (value 97)
   - Third highest: Item 4 (value 94)

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 64)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (value 58)
   - Third highest: Item 1 (value 49)

Now, let's make allocations in a way that aims to balance the total value for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Start by assigning Item 6 (value 89), then Item 2 (value 86).
- **Agent 1:** Assign Item 5 (value 97), then Item 4 (value 94).
- **Agent 2:** Assign Item 3 (value 58), then Item 1 (value 49).

We now have 2 items left: Item 0 and Item 7.

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 43 for Agent 0) and Item 7 to Agent 2 (value 6 for Agent 2).

This allocation aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that aligns with their highest valuations.
