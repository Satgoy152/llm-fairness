Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  36  20  96  29  75  99  20
1  95  98  27  84  73  88  23  72
2  28  83  44  52   9  72  79  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 83 44 52  9 72 79 26]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation given their own valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate items fairly:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 3 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent will ideally receive about 8/3 â‰ˆ 2.67 items. Since we cannot allocate fractions of items, two agents will receive 3 items, and one agent will receive 2 items.

2. **Valuation Table:**
   ```
   Agent 0: [67, 36, 20, 96, 29, 75, 99, 20]
   Agent 1: [95, 98, 27, 84, 73, 88, 23, 72]
   Agent 2: [28, 83, 44, 52, 9, 72, 79, 26]
   ```

3. **Item-by-item Allocation (Greedy Algorithm):**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most and ensure each agent receives the approximate number of items.
   - Adjust if necessary to maintain fairness.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (95), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (98), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 2 (44), assign to Agent 2.
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (96), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (73), Agent 1 already has 2 items, assign to Agent 0 (29).
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (75), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (99), Agent 0 already has 3 items, assign to Agent 2 (79).
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 1 (72), Agent 1 already has 2 items, assign to Agent 2 (26).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [3, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 2: Items [2, 6, 7]

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
