Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  49  86  80  41  25  99  76
1  30  50  51  29  37  43  86  74
2  56  39  50  93  84   2  18  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 39 50 93 84  2 18 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure some level of fairness, potentially aiming for envy-freeness or maximizing the total value received by each agent. Given that we have 3 agents and 8 items, let's aim for a fair allocation based on the valuations provided.

First, let's summarize the value each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0: [64, 49, 86, 80, 41, 25, 99, 76]
- Agent 1: [30, 50, 51, 29, 37, 43, 86, 74]
- Agent 2: [56, 39, 50, 93, 84, 2, 18, 71]

We'll attempt to allocate these items such that each agent receives a relatively fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 6.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3.

2. **Allocate Item 6**:
   - Item 6 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. However, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (99). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (93). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest value for Agent 0 (64). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Highest value for Agent 0 (49). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Highest value for Agent 0 (86). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest value for Agent 2 (84). Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 5: Highest value for Agent 1 (43). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 7: Highest value for Agent 0 (76). Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]

This distribution attempts to maximize the individual agent's valuations while ensuring each agent receives some items. Note that this allocation focuses on maximizing the perceived value for each agent based on their highest preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
