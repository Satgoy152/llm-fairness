Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  99  83  97   0   8  53  37
1  39  76   5   7   6  58  85  95
2  13   3  30   4  47  73  14  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. Here, we will use a simple heuristic to approximate an envy-free allocation:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 3. We'll start by giving them these high-value items.
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: Agent 1 values item 7 the most, so we'll allocate it to them first.
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so we'll allocate it to them first.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent, while aiming to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: After 1 and 3, the next highest values are for items 2 and 0.
- **Agent 1**: After 7, the next highest values are for items 6 and 5 (already taken by Agent 2).
- **Agent 2**: After 5, the next highest values are for items 4 and 7 (already taken by Agent 1).

Let's allocate the remaining items based on these considerations to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 6, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 5

This allocation tries to balance the highest preferences for each agent, considering their top-valued items and ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent items they highly value, while also ensuring every item is allocated and each agent gets a fair portion of their preferred items.
