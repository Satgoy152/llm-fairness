Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  75  29  87  55  42  74  16
1  41  11  54  90   7  38  96  32
2  59  20  22  59  48  71  96  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, the goal is to achieve a division that is as envy-free as possible. This typically means that each agent should feel they received a fair share, given their valuations of the items. 

In this scenario, we will follow an approach to try to minimize envy by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, a balanced allocation would typically mean each agent receives approximately 2-3 items.

Let's follow a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least 2 items, as 8 items must be divided between the 3 agents.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure the total number of items allocated is 8.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 87, then item 1 at 75.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 90, but agent 0 already has item 3. Next, agent 1 values item 6 at 96.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 96, but agent 1 already has item 6. Next, agent 2 values item 5 at 71.

**Initial Assignments:**
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 6
- Agent 2: Items 5

**Remaining Items (to be assigned):** 0, 2, 4, 7

- Agent 0: Valuations for the remaining items (0, 2, 4, 7) are 61, 29, 55, and 16. Highest is item 0 at 61.
- Agent 1: Valuations for the remaining items (0, 2, 4, 7) are 41, 54, 7, and 32. Highest is item 2 at 54.
- Agent 2: Valuations for the remaining items (0, 2, 4, 7) are 59, 22, 48, and 54. Highest is item 4 at 48.

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 0
- Agent 1: Items 6, 2
- Agent 2: Items 5, 4, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to minimize envy based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5, 4, 7]
}
```
