Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  82  85  35  66  42  26  91
1  49  99  85  92  93   4  28  10
2  30  54  94  99  36  19   5  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value for their allocated items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on the items, and try to ensure that each agent's allocation is as close to their maximum possible valuation as can be achieved given the constraints.

2. We will use a method that attempts to give each agent the items they value most, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Let's attempt an allocation based on this:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (91), followed by item 2 (85), item 1 (82), item 4 (66), item 0 (55), item 5 (42), item 3 (35), and item 6 (26).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (99), followed by item 4 (93), item 3 (92), item 2 (85), item 0 (49), item 6 (28), item 7 (10), and item 5 (4).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (99), followed by item 2 (94), item 7 (86), item 1 (54), item 4 (36), item 0 (30), item 5 (19), and item 6 (5).

To ensure a fair allocation, we'll prioritize giving each agent the items they value most while ensuring they each get a reasonable share:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, since they value it the most.
2. Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as they value it highly.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, since they value it the most.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest value.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it maximizes their remaining value.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, since it is highly valued by them.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is more valuable to them than the other options.
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it provides them more value in comparison to other agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and attempts to minimize envy by maximizing individual valuations within constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items fairly across the 3 agents.
