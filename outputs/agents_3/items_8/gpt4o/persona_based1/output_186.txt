Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  89  12  44  74  73  66  99
1   4  36  99  87  15   1  33  76
2  25  42  64  77  35  19  74  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible or at least minimizes envy. This means that each agent should feel that their bundle is at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation. However, with discrete items and varying valuations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, but we can strive for an allocation that is fair and balanced.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to find an allocation that minimizes envy:

- **Agent 0** values item 7 the most (99), followed by item 1 (89), item 4 (74), and item 5 (73).
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (99), followed by item 3 (87), item 7 (76), and item 1 (36).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (77), followed by item 6 (74), item 2 (64), and item 7 (73).

Considering these preferences, we can attempt an allocation:

1. Start by allocating high-value items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets approximately an equal total value according to their valuation.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (valued at 99).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 99).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (valued at 77).

Now, distribute the remaining items to balance the total perceived value for each agent:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 89).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (valued at 74).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (valued at 74).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (valued at 25).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (valued at 1).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation perceived by each agent, given their preferences. Each agent has a set of items that they value reasonably highly, aiming to minimize envy.
