Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  11  20  67   7  43   4  77
1  25  15  65  42   0  12  70  30
2  18  49  82   5  47  24  30  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as being at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's start by considering the agents' highest-valued items and try to distribute them to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:
   - Highest values are for items: 0 (81), 7 (77), and 3 (67).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Highest values are for items: 6 (70), 2 (65), and 3 (42).

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - Highest values are for items: 2 (82), 7 (82), and 1 (49).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 7. We can give these two to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values items 6 and 2. We can give these two to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values items 2 and 7, but since Agent 1 has already received item 2, we can consider other combinations. We can give items 1, 5, and 3 to Agent 2 to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's finalize the allocations based on the above deliberations:

- Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 6 and 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 3, 1, 4, and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation considers the highest preferences and tries to minimize any envy among agents, ensuring that each agent receives what they value highly relative to other items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [3, 1, 4, 5]
}
```
