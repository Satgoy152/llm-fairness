Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65   4   9  63  21  45  48  27
1  84  87  13  47  18  66  31  96
2  60  56   2  18  83  62  52  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, one potential approach is to consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuation. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly at 65, and item 3 at 63.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 87 and item 7 at 96.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 83 and item 7 at 77.

We can start by allocating items based on the highest valuations to each agent, then proceed to allocate the remaining items by considering each agent's next highest valuation, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

### Suggested Allocation:

1. **Allocate high-value items to each agent based on their highest preferences:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 65, highest for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 87, highest for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (valued at 83, highest for Agent 2).

2. **Allocate remaining items considering each agent's next highest preferences:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 63).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (valued at 96).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (valued at 62).

3. **Distribute the remaining items (2 and 6) to maintain balance:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 9).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (valued at 52).

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations while minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
