Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  30  75  32  28  83   4  48
1  43  22  74  30  37  13   6  38
2  24   4  36  37  48  63  76  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 30 75 32 28 83  4 48]
 [43 22 74 30 37 13  6 38]
 [24  4 36 37 48 63 76 13]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while attempting to minimize envy, we can use an envy-free algorithm such as the adjusted winner procedure. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the small number of items, we can manually try to balance the allocations based on the valuations to ensure each agent gets items they value highly. 

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 74 + 30 + 75 + 32 + 28 + 83 + 4 + 48 = 374
- Agent 1: 43 + 22 + 74 + 30 + 37 + 13 + 6 + 38 = 263
- Agent 2: 24 + 4 + 36 + 37 + 48 + 63 + 76 + 13 = 301

Now, let's distribute the items by considering each agent's strong preferences:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0, 2, and 5 the most. Let's allocate items 0, 2, and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 2 and 0 significantly but these are already allocated. Their next preferences are items 3 and 7. Let's allocate items 3 and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 6 and 5 significantly, but item 5 is already allocated. Their next preferences are items 6 and 4. Let's allocate items 6 and 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to check the remaining items. Currently, we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Item 1 is left unallocated.

4. **Agent 0** has items 0, 2, and 5. Let's review their preference for the remaining item: item 1.

5. **Agent 1** has items 3 and 7. They have a higher value for item 1 compared to Agent 2.

Based on this, we can allocate item 1 to **Agent 1**. 

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.
