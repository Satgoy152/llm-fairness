Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  20  80  44  35  45  78  99
1  44   7  78  23  72  25  59  18
2  69  76  36  82  89  12  37  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44  7 78 23 72 25 59 18]
 [69 76 36 82 89 12 37 61]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's, based on their own valuation. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations Table:

- Agent 0: [96, 20, 80, 44, 35, 45, 78, 99]
- Agent 1: [44, 7, 78, 23, 72, 25, 59, 18]
- Agent 2: [69, 76, 36, 82, 89, 12, 37, 61]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 7.
2. **Agent 2** highly values items 3 and 4.
3. **Agent 1** has relatively high values for items 2 and 4.

Let's attempt to allocate items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their highest valued items, and then fill in the rest to ensure all items are allocated.

#### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 0 and 7. Allocate these to Agent 0.
  - Allocated items to Agent 0: [0, 7]

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 2 and 4. Allocate these to Agent 1.
  - Allocated items to Agent 1: [2, 4]

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 3 and 4, but item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
  - Next highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 1, which is not yet allocated. Allocate this to Agent 2.
  - Allocated items to Agent 2: [3, 1]

Now, we have allocated 6 items. Items 5 and 6 are left.

#### Allocate Remaining Items:

- **Agent 0** has a moderate value for item 6, which might be beneficial for their envy-freeness. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has a relative preference for item 5 among the remaining items, so assign item 5 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

Each agent has received at least two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8, satisfying the allocation requirements.
