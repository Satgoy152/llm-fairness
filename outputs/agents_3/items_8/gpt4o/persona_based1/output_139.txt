Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  15  75  49  55  76  24  68
1  20  42  12  68  25  51  14   2
2  22  86  98  96  74  19  33  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also making sure that no agent envies the allocation of another agent. This is not always perfectly achievable, but we aim to make the distribution as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Items 5 (76), 2 (75), and 7 (68).
   - Allocate items 5 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Items 3 (68), 1 (42), and 5 (51) which is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Allocate items 3 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Items 2 (98), 3 (96), and 1 (86), but items 2 and 3 are already taken.
   - Allocate items 4 (74) and 7 (71) to Agent 2.

Re-evaluate the remaining items:

- Items left to allocate: 0, 6
- Agents without recent allocations: Agent 0

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate remaining items 0 and 6 to Agent 0, as they have received fewer items so far, and it aligns with their second-tier preferences.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items based on their highest valuations as much as possible, aiming for a fair distribution.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```
