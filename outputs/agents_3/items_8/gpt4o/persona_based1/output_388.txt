Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  18  36  33  30   1  16  38
1  86  42  72  50  92  86  64   7
2  15   2  16  20  36   6  44  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can use a heuristic approach. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while still ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's consider the valuations for each agent and try to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives at least two items (since there are 8 items and 3 agents) and minimizing envy between them.

Given the agents' valuations, let's proceed step-by-step to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** has a strong preference for items 4 and 5 (highest values: 92 and 86). Allocating these to agent 1 maximizes their value.
   
2. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (69), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.

3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (44), so allocate item 6 to agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 3, 7) while ensuring each agent gets at least two items:

4. **Agent 0** can be allocated item 1, which they value at 18, and item 2, which they value at 36.

5. **Agent 2** can be allocated item 3, which they value at 20.

6. **Agent 0** can be allocated item 7, which they value at 38.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items and tries to balance the overall value each agent receives.

Based on this reasoning, the allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

Here, each agent receives a fair share of the items, and we have allocated all 8 items.
