Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  94  69  81  37  10  91  77
1   0  99  41  51   0  84   0  80
2  47  69  21   4  88  96  19  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of another agent. We'll aim to maximize the value each agent receives based on their own valuation, trying to balance the allocations as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly with a maximum valuation of 94 for item 1.
- Agent 1 has a strong preference for item 1 (99) and item 5 (84).
- Agent 2 values items 4 (88) and 5 (96) highly.

Given these preferences, we can try to allocate items to maximize fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest total valuation among all agents, so we aim to give them items they value highly, but avoid items that are crucial for other agents.
2. **Agent 1** should get item 1, as it has their highest valuation, and item 5 as it is also highly valued by them.
3. **Agent 2** should primarily receive items 4 and 5, due to their high valuation of these items.

Let's propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 6, 7]. This gives Agent 0 a high total valuation and avoids items with the highest conflict.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3]. Agent 1 gets item 1, which they value the highest, and item 3, which they value significantly higher than others.
- Agent 2 receives items [4, 5]. Agent 2 gets item 5, which they value highly, and item 4, which is their second most valued item.

Now, let's check for envy-freeness:

- Agent 0: The total value they get is 88 + 69 + 91 + 77 = 325.
- Agent 1: The total value they get is 99 + 51 = 150.
- Agent 2: The total value they get is 88 + 96 = 184.

Given this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, making them reasonably satisfied with their allocation compared to others. The distribution tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
