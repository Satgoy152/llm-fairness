Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  20  12  52  78  93  44  84
1  26  79  22  69  78  65   2   8
2  37  87  17   7  19  79  53  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we want to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy and, if possible, achieves envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means each agent should value their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze some possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Items with the highest values: 5 (93), 4 (78), 7 (84), 3 (52).
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Items with the highest values: 1 (79), 3 (69), 4 (78), 5 (65).
   
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Items with the highest values: 1 (87), 5 (79), 6 (53), 7 (46).

Focusing on items with the highest individual valuations and trying to distribute them fairly, we can consider the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Best picks might be items 5, 7 due to high value (93, 84).
- **Agent 1**: Best picks might be items 1, 3 due to high value (79, 69).
- **Agent 2**: Best picks might be items 4, 6 due to high value (19, 53).

This leaves us with items 0 and 2.

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 has the highest value for it (37).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 has the highest value for it (12).

The allocations in this scenario would be:

- Agent 0: 5, 7, 2
- Agent 1: 1, 3
- Agent 2: 4, 6, 0

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the fairness by distributing items with the highest valuations to the agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent receives at least two items and no items are left unallocated.
