Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  50  55  23  80   8  90  99
1  60  55   6  38   1  43  98  30
2  12  76  72  96  77  28  87  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 55  6 38  1 43 98 30]
 [12 76 72 96 77 28 87 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible. We will use the valuations given to guide our allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's bundle of goods over their own, based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0:** 92 + 50 + 55 + 23 + 80 + 8 + 90 + 99 = 497
- **Agent 1:** 60 + 55 + 6 + 38 + 1 + 43 + 98 + 30 = 331
- **Agent 2:** 12 + 76 + 72 + 96 + 77 + 28 + 87 + 70 = 518

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items such that the total value of the items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible, keeping integer allocations in mind.

To begin, we will assign items based on the highest valuations each agent has for individual items, and then we will adjust to balance the total value.

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most with 99, item 0 with 92, and item 6 with 90.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the most with 98, item 0 with 60, and item 1 with 55.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most with 96, item 4 with 77, and item 7 with 70.

Based on these observations, we can make an initial allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, continue allocating items to balance the total value:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it highly).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it higher than others).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it fairly even though it's low).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it the most).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (to balance the values further).

After this allocation, let's check the total value for each agent:

- **Agent 0** has items [0, 7]: Total value = 92 + 99 = 191
- **Agent 1** has items [2, 5, 6]: Total value = 6 + 43 + 98 = 147
- **Agent 2** has items [1, 3, 4]: Total value = 76 + 96 + 77 = 249

The total allocation is fairly balanced given the constraints of integer allocations and the unique valuations for each item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
