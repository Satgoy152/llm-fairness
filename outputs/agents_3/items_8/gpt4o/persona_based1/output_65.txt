Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25   8  60  90  92   1  36  45
1  95  54  68  13  59  22  79  16
2  95  74  70  71  81  32   5  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25  8 60 90 92  1 36 45]
 [95 54 68 13 59 22 79 16]
 [95 74 70 71 81 32  5 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent values their own allocation at least as highly as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we'll use a heuristic approach to approximate a fair distribution.

### Step 1: Initial Observations
- Each agent should ideally receive around 2-3 items since there are 8 items and 3 agents.
- We will try to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their own bundle, while ensuring that no agent envies another.

### Step 2: Allocation Process
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (90) and item 4 (92). Assign these items to Agent 0 as they have high values compared to others.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (95). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Next, consider item 6, which has a high value (79) for Agent 1. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for item 2 (70) and item 7 (91). Assign these items to Agent 2.

### Step 3: Remaining Items
- Items left: 1 and 5.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 has a lower valuation for item 1 (8) and item 5 (1) compared to others. We'll allocate these items based on minimizing envy.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (32 valuation).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (54 valuation).

### Step 4: Final Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 4].
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1, 6].
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5, 7].

This allocation gives each agent items such that their total valuation is competitive and minimizes potential envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
