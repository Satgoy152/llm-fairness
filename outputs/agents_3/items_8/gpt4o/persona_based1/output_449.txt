Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  70  55  19  20  64   6  23
1  57  92  49  85  85  22  42  26
2  87  58  19  93   7  90  66  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free or as close to an envy-free allocation as possible, considering each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding such an allocation:

1. **Understand the Valuations**: We have the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate these items such that the perceived value each agent receives is as equitable as possible.

2. **Initial Allocation**: We will start by attempting to allocate items to the agents with a focus on maximizing their satisfaction based on their highest-valued items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Once an initial allocation is made, we will adjust if necessary to minimize envy among the agents.

### Valuations Matrix

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 68     | 70     | 55     | 19     | 20     | 64     | 6      | 23     |
| 1     | 57     | 92     | 49     | 85     | 85     | 22     | 42     | 26     |
| 2     | 87     | 58     | 19     | 93     | 7      | 90     | 66     | 97     |

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 1 and 0, as these have the highest valuations for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 1 and 3, since these have the highest valuations.
- **Agent 2**: Prioritize items 7, 3, and 5, which are highly valued.

Given these priorities, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Assign items 1, 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3, 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 7, 5, 6, 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives us a breakdown as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items 1, 0, with total valuation = 70 + 68 = 138.
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 3, 4, with total valuation = 85 + 85 = 170.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 7, 5, 6, 2, with total valuation = 97 + 90 + 66 + 19 = 272.

Upon examining the allocations, Agent 1 and Agent 0 might perceive some envy towards Agent 2 because their total valuations are lower. However, each agent receives their most valued items available, and the allocation is balanced in terms of total items.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. It minimizes envy by assigning high-value items according to each agent's preferences, within the constraints provided.
