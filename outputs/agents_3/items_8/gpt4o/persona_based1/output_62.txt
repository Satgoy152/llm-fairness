Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  46  80  79  37  60  39  66
1  55  89  11  66  45  88  18  46
2  31  12  48  33  53  80  72  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 12 48 33 53 80 72 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to minimize envy by assigning items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 74 + 46 + 80 + 79 + 37 + 60 + 39 + 66 = 481
- Agent 1's total valuation: 55 + 89 + 11 + 66 + 45 + 88 + 18 + 46 = 418
- Agent 2's total valuation: 31 + 12 + 48 + 33 + 53 + 80 + 72 + 78 = 407

Now, let's allocate the items based on the valuations, trying to ensure that we distribute them in a way that is as envy-free as possible:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (80), 3 (79)
   - Allocate items: 2, 3

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (89), 5 (88)
   - Allocate items: 1, 5

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 6 (72), 7 (78)
   - Allocate items: 6, 7

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 4. We will assign them based on maximizing fairness and minimizing envy:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 53.

With these allocations, the distribution should be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6, 7

These allocations attempt to minimize envy by assigning items that each agent values highly.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
