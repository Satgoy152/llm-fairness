Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  54  97  68  47  52  48  96
1   3  37  93  91   7  30  91  62
2  21  58  63  32  50  42  62  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [21 58 63 32 50 42 62 59]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that satisfies envy-freeness as much as possible. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocations of the other agents.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 96     | 54     | 97     | 68     | 47     | 52     | 48     | 96     |
| 1     | 3      | 37     | 93     | 91     | 7      | 30     | 91     | 62     |
| 2     | 21     | 58     | 63     | 32     | 50     | 42     | 62     | 59     |

One approach to create an envy-free allocation is to assign items based on the highest valuations of each agent, ensuring that each agent gets items that they value significantly.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 0 (96), Item 7 (96)
   - Assign Items: 2, 0, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 6 (91), Item 2 (93) (already taken by Agent 0)
   - Assign Items: 3, 6

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (58), Item 4 (50), Item 5 (42), Item 2 (63) (already taken by Agent 0)
   - Assign Items: 1, 4, 5

### Final Allocation:

Given these considerations and ensuring that each agent gets at least some items they value, here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives a subset of items that they value highly. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent's bundle of items is among the most valued to them, given the constraints.
