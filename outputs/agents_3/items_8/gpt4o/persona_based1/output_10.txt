Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  32  61  65  76  62   4  57
1  51  94  65   8  38   8  44  27
2  30   2  38  67  45   3   6  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

We'll try to balance the allocations by considering the following approach:
1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible.
3. Ensure that every agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's first calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 27 + 32 + 61 + 65 + 76 + 62 + 4 + 57 = 384
- Agent 1's total valuation: 51 + 94 + 65 + 8 + 38 + 8 + 44 + 27 = 335
- Agent 2's total valuation: 30 + 2 + 38 + 67 + 45 + 3 + 6 + 37 = 228

Given these total valuations, we can allocate items to agents to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 4 and 3, so we allocate these two items to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3, but this was already allocated to agent 0. We can prioritize other items for agent 2, like item 0.
4. Allocate remaining items to balance total values.

Here's a plausible allocation based on balancing total valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 7
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide each agent with a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations.
