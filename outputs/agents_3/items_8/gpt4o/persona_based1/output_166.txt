Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96   4  89  77  20  36   5  32
1  48  55  65  79  86  96  85   4
2  50  88  59  77  72  22  76  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that respects envy-freeness as much as possible, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. However, due to the discrete nature of the items and the varying valuations, perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible. Instead, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 5, 4, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1, 0, and 3.

Let's allocate items based on a rough approximation of maximizing each agent's perceived value, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 5, 4, and 3.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1, 6, and 7.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items among the agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 4, 3],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives a reasonable attempt at fairness, considering the valuations provided.
