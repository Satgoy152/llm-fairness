Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  40  54  46  44  86  70  51
1  40   2  75  80  83  20  82  92
2  11  23  38  61  20  13   2  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. A common approach in such situations is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the minimum satisfaction (in terms of total value received) across all agents is maximized and no agent envies another's allocation significantly.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 90 + 40 + 54 + 46 + 44 + 86 + 70 + 51 = 481
- Agent 1's total valuation: 40 + 2 + 75 + 80 + 83 + 20 + 82 + 92 = 474
- Agent 2's total valuation: 11 + 23 + 38 + 61 + 20 + 13 + 2 + 47 = 215

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 1** seems to have a strong preference for items 2, 3, 4, and 7. Assign these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 5. Assign these items to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has fewer high valuations, so we should try to give them items that are less valued by others but still leave them with something. Assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 2.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5 (Values: 90, 86)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4, 7 (Values: 75, 80, 83, 92)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6 (Values: 23, 2)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences:

- Total value for Agent 0: 176
- Total value for Agent 1: 330
- Total value for Agent 2: 25

The allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it tries to maximize the minimum value received by each agent.

Here's the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```
