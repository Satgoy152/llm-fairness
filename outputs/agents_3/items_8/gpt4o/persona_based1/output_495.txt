Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  71  38  51  66  56  61  90
1  78   1  70  19   9  46  59  29
2  11  86  25  96  57  44  34   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations, we will strive to minimize envy.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that Agent 0 values highly compared to others. Items 1 and 7 are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most, followed by item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most, followed by item 4.

Let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: After items 1 and 7, consider items 5 and 6 since their values are relatively high for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: After items 0 and 2, item 6 also has a decent value for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: After items 3 and 4, item 5 has some value for Agent 2.

After this analysis, a fair distribution could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 6, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4, 5

This allocation attempts to balance the highest valuations while considering fairness. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
