Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  31  14  84  25  59  83  65
1  44  85  20  79  68   7  70  33
2  13  28  74   2  80  10  54  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 85 20 79 68  7 70 33]
 [13 28 74  2 80 10 54 74]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible. Since we have to allocate all 8 items, each agent should ideally receive around 2 to 3 items.

Let's evaluate the values each agent assigns to the items they might receive, and consider potential allocations:

**Agent 0:**
- High values: Item 0 (90), Item 3 (84), Item 6 (83)
- Medium values: Item 5 (59), Item 7 (65)

**Agent 1:**
- High values: Item 1 (85), Item 3 (79), Item 4 (68), Item 6 (70)
- Medium values: Item 0 (44)

**Agent 2:**
- High values: Item 4 (80), Item 2 (74), Item 7 (74)
- Medium values: Item 6 (54), Item 1 (28)

We want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here's a potential allocation that tries to balance the high-value items among the agents:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 5, 6] - This gives Agent 0 two of their high-value items and one medium-value item.
- **Agent 1:** [1, 3] - Agent 1 receives two high-value items.
- **Agent 2:** [2, 4, 7] - Agent 2 receives two high-value items and one medium-value item.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy among them.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
