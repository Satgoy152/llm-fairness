Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  25  59  68  41  35  84  96
1  12  35  11  12  73  98  10  64
2  47  31  71  54  70  20  53   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among three agents while ensuring envy-freeness and fairness, we can consider various principles of fair division. One common approach is the "maximum marginal value" method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This approach can help reduce envy among agents.

Let's review the valuation table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 11     | 25     | 59     | 68     | 41     | 35     | 84     | 96     |
| 1     | 12     | 35     | 11     | 12     | 73     | 98     | 10     | 64     |
| 2     | 47     | 31     | 71     | 54     | 70     | 20     | 53     | 4      |

Now, we allocate each item to the agent who values it most:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it highest at 47.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it highest at 35.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it highest at 71.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it highest at 68.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest at 73.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it highest at 98.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it highest at 84.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it highest at 96.

Now, let's confirm the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 6, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 4, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 2

All items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
