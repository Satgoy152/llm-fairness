Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  32  15  28  73  55  77  84
1  49  93  46  42  53  34  22  36
2  64  58  59  86  73  91  67  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free distribution. Envy-freeness means each agent believes they received the best possible bundle of items based on their valuations, minimizing envy towards bundles received by other agents. 

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [56, 32, 15, 28, 73, 55, 77, 84]
- Agent 1: [49, 93, 46, 42, 53, 34, 22, 36]
- Agent 2: [64, 58, 59, 86, 73, 91, 67, 77]

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a greedy algorithm that considers the highest valuations first. Here is a strategy to allocate items:

1. Rank each agent's preferences for items based on their valuations.
2. Allocate the highest valued item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more items than others until the end.

Following this approach, we allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 7 is most valued by agent 0 (84), allocate to agent 0.
2. Item 5 is most valued by agent 2 (91), allocate to agent 2.
3. Item 1 is most valued by agent 1 (93), allocate to agent 1.
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 (86), allocate to agent 2.
5. Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 (77), allocate to agent 0.
6. Item 0 is most valued by agent 0 (56), allocate to agent 0.
7. Item 4 is equally valued by agents 0 and 2 (73), allocate to agent 2 to balance number of items.
8. Item 2 is most valued by agent 2 (59), allocate to agent 2.

The allocations are balanced in terms of the number of items:

- Agent 0: 3 items (0, 6, 7)
- Agent 1: 1 item (1)
- Agent 2: 4 items (2, 3, 4, 5)

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
