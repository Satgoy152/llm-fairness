Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  35  54  24   0  81  71  21
1   9   4   8  90  15  66  99  72
2  12  56  38  64  80  41  11  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9  4  8 90 15 66 99 72]
 [12 56 38 64 80 41 11 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation where no agent envies another agent's allocation. This is known as an envy-free allocation. One common approach is to use an algorithm such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," which can sometimes achieve envy-freeness.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process that attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1's Preferences:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2's Preferences:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 0's Next Choice:** Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 1's Next Choice:** Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
6. **Agent 2's Next Choice:** Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 0's Next Choice:** Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 2's Next Choice:** Finally, Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 2.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5, 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 1, 7

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 2],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 1, 7]
}
```
