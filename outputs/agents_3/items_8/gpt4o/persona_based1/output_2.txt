Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  38  63  38  16  23  53  56
1  49  71  54  78  42  29  78  72
2  23  53  46  49  18   0  54  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation fairly in comparison to others. One common approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or similar algorithms, but given the small scale, we can perform a direct allocation analysis.

Let's consider the valuations and try to assign items to agents based on their highest preferences, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share and that all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (63), 0 (58)
   - Allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (78), 6 (78), 7 (72), 1 (71)
   - Allocate items 3, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation items: 6 (54), 1 (53), 3 (49)
   - Since item 6 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 5 (0) and item 4 (18) to Agent 2 to distribute the remaining items.

### Final Allocation:

The above approach ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. Now, letâ€™s summarize the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to be envy-free while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
