Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  53  62  45   8  75  12  47
1  66  58  12   3  38  62  65  53
2  57  24  93  17  77  18  71  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 58 12  3 38 62 65 53]
 [57 24 93 17 77 18 71 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their valuation while maintaining some degree of fairness. Since we have three agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive around \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \) items, meaning some agents will receive 2 items and others 3 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (75), 0 (71), 2 (62), 1 (53)
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valued items: 6 (65), 0 (66), 1 (58), 5 (62)
   
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (93), 4 (77), 6 (71)

We'll allocate items starting with the highest valued items for each agent:

- **Allocate Item 5** to Agent 0 (value: 75)
- **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 1 (value: 66)
- **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 2 (value: 93)

Now, allocate the remaining items considering each agent's next preferred choices:

- **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 0 (value: 53)
- **Allocate Item 6** to Agent 2 (value: 71)
- **Allocate Item 4** to Agent 2 (value: 77)

We have allocated 6 items. Two items remain (Items 3 and 7). Let's allocate these considering the remaining preferences:

- **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0 (value: 45)
- **Allocate Item 7** to Agent 1 (value: 53)

Thus, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6, 4

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 6, 4]
}
```
