Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  33  41  11  39  58   5  57
1   7  15  18  89  55  30  36  48
2  26  55  85  90  19  99  96  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items. One approach to achieving this is to attempt to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. Given the valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 3 and a reasonable valuation for items 4 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 5 and 6, and a decent value for item 2.

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 64 + 33 + 41 = 138

- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 89 + 55 = 144

- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 6, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 2: 99 + 96 + 12 = 207

While this allocation doesn't perfectly balance the total valuation each agent receives, it attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and every agent receives at least one item.
