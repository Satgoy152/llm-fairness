Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  58   3  79  95  21  13  88
1  28  84  29  68   5   8   7  12
2  86  67   1  81  21  74  93  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we'll aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should value their own bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given that the number of items (8) is divisible by the number of agents (3), we can start by trying to allocate roughly equal numbers of items to each agent, which is 2 or 3 items per agent.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: Highest values are for items 4 (95), 3 (79), and 7 (88).
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: Highest values are for items 1 (84), 3 (68), and 2 (29).
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: Highest values are for items 6 (93), 0 (86), and 3 (81).

Given this, let's start by assigning each agent their highest-valued items:

- **Agent 0** gets item 4 (value 95) and item 7 (value 88).
- **Agent 2** gets item 6 (value 93) and item 0 (value 86).
- **Agent 1** needs to get items that don't overlap the highest values for agents 0 and 2. Therefore, we consider items 1 (value 84) and 3 (value 68) for agent 1.

Now, let's assign the remaining items to ensure each agent has at least two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 4 and 7. Add item 5 (value 21) to give agent 0 three items.
- **Agent 1**: Already has items 1 and 3. Add item 2 (value 29) to give agent 1 three items.
- **Agent 2**: Already has items 6 and 0. Add item 8 to ensure all items are allocated, but since there is no item 8, it seems there is an error in observation. Instead, we need to look at unallocated items for agent 2.

Upon reviewing, we should correct:
- **Agent 2** should also get item 5, but since agent 0 has it, we swap items 5 and 2 between agents 0 and 1 to ensure completeness.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items and attempts to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives at least two items.
