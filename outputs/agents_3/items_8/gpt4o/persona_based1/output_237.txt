Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  75  59  58  52  59  61  89
1  29   9  11  43  64  75  75  72
2  86   6  94  27  98  82  72   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29  9 11 43 64 75 75 72]
 [86  6 94 27 98 82 72  6]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we need to ensure each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values theirs. We'll use a method that aims to balance the valuations across agents and minimizes envy.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [12, 75, 59, 58, 52, 59, 61, 89]
- Agent 1: [29, 9, 11, 43, 64, 75, 75, 72]
- Agent 2: [86, 6, 94, 27, 98, 82, 72, 6]

The strategy is to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items that maximize their utility while considering the other agents' valuations to minimize envy.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 7 (89), 1 (75), 6 (61)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 for the highest value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (75), 6 (75), 4 (64)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 for the highest value.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (98), 2 (94), 0 (86)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 for the highest value.

Let's update the allocations and continue:

- Agent 0 has item 7
- Agent 1 has item 5
- Agent 2 has item 4

Now, consider the remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining high-value items: 1 (75), 6 (61)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining high-value items: 2 (94), 0 (86)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

6. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining high-value items: 6 (75), 3 (43)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

Now, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 1
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 4, 2

The remaining items are 0 and 3.

7. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, since it's their next highest valued item.

8. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it provides some value.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 7, 1
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 2, 0

Let's ensure this allocation is fair and present it in the required JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [5, 6, 3],
    "2": [4, 2, 0]
}
```
