Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  86  45  50  10  16  48  47
1  56  39  64  47  60  33  30  43
2  31  22  19  46  60  76  57  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's first review the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 92 + 86 + 45 + 50 + 10 + 16 + 48 + 47 = 394
- Agent 1: 56 + 39 + 64 + 47 + 60 + 33 + 30 + 43 = 372
- Agent 2: 31 + 22 + 19 + 46 + 60 + 76 + 57 + 68 = 379

Since there are 8 items, and 3 agents, the goal is to distribute the items so each agent gets a fair share. Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Assign items to each agent based on maximizing their perceived value and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's make a tentative allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0 (92), 1 (86), 6 (48)
  - Total Value: 226

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 2 (64), 4 (60), 7 (43)
  - Total Value: 167

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: 3 (46), 5 (76)
  - Total Value: 122

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that they value highly. Now let's check the sums:

- Total items allocated: 3 (Agent 0) + 3 (Agent 1) + 2 (Agent 2) = 8 items
- All items are allocated, and each agent gets a share that is reasonable given their valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair by considering each agent's valuations and ensuring all items are distributed.
