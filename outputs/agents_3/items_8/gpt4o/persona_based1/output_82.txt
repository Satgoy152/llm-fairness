Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  44  97  36   3  86   1  88
1  45  22  85  51  53  81  68  53
2  26  60  16  93  48  48  36  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 22 85 51 53 81 68 53]
 [26 60 16 93 48 48 36 37]]
Output:
To allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents in a way that is fair and minimizes envy, we can use the method of ensuring that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuation while balancing the total value received by each agent.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 49 + 44 + 97 + 36 + 3 + 86 + 1 + 88 = 404
- Agent 1: 45 + 22 + 85 + 51 + 53 + 81 + 68 + 53 = 458
- Agent 2: 26 + 60 + 16 + 93 + 48 + 48 + 36 + 37 = 364

Next, we aim to allocate the items to each agent such that the distribution is as fair as possible. We'll assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent while keeping track of the total items assigned.

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 97)
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 93)
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 88)
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 81)
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 68)
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 49)
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 60)
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 53)

After this allocation, the agents receive the following items:

- Agent 0: [2, 7, 0] 
- Agent 1: [5, 6, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 0],
    "1": [5, 6, 4],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
