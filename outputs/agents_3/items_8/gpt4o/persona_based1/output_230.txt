Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  99  65  58  56  22  23  30
1  91  28  99  75  43  80   8  15
2  88  80  87  54  51  90  24  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly divide the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations, considering that each agent might value the items differently.

Given the following valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 17     | 99     | 65     | 58     | 56     | 22     | 23     | 30     |
| 1     | 91     | 28     | 99     | 75     | 43     | 80     | 8      | 15     |
| 2     | 88     | 80     | 87     | 54     | 51     | 90     | 24     | 83     |

One possible approach to ensure fairness and minimize envy is to use an allocation method like the "maximin" or "envy-free" approach where each agent gets items that maximize their minimum satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (99) and item 2 (65).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (99), item 0 (91), and item 5 (80).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 5 (90), item 0 (88), and item 2 (87).

2. **Assigning High-Value Items**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it's the highest valued by them.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 as it is highly valued by them and Agent 1 values it as well, but Agent 2 values it slightly less than their top choice (item 5).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since it's highly valued by them and somewhat less by others.

3. **Distributing Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, since they have the highest valuation for it, and it helps achieve balance given their allocation of item 5.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 to balance their allocation with a moderately valued item.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2, offering them a moderately valued item and ensuring variety in their allocation.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 to complete their allocation.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 to complete their allocation.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, and the distribution is designed to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valued items while maintaining a balance in the total value perceived by each agent.
