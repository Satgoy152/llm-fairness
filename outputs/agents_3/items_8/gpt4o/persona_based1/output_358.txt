Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  56  92  15  28  87  13  89
1   9  18  48  32  41  64  88  46
2  60  14  60  57   7   3  48  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [60 14 60 57  7  3 48 98]]
Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, but we can attempt to find an allocation that seems balanced given the provided valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**
   - Values items 2 and 7 very highly (92 and 89).
   - Medium value for item 5 (87).
   
2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Values item 6 very highly (88).
   - Medium value for item 5 (64) and item 4 (41).
   
3. **Agent 2 Valuations:**
   - Values item 7 very highly (98).
   - Medium value for items 0 and 2 (60 each).

A reasonable strategy is to prioritize giving high-value items to different agents to minimize envy. Here is a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 5 (high/medium value to Agent 0, low to others)
- **Agent 1:** Items 4, 6 (high/medium value to Agent 1, low to others)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 7 (high value to Agent 2, medium to Agent 0)
- Remaining Items: 1, 3

Now, allocate the remaining items (1, 3) in a way that seems most balanced:

- **Agent 0:** Item 1 (high value to Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Item 3 (medium value to Agent 1)

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent some of their most valued items while distributing the lesser-valued items to balance the total allocations. 

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 6, 3],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their higher-valued items and spreads the remaining items to balance the total perceived utility.
