Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  23  83  72  27  35  47  16
1   9  80  52  25  34  85  15  96
2   5  26  26  42  45  86  18  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent receives a portion of the items that they value highly. Here, we have three agents and eight items, so each agent should ideally receive around 2-3 items. We'll begin by considering the relative valuations of each item by each agent and attempt to allocate items so that no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation items: 2 (83), 3 (72)
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation items: 1 (80), 5 (85), 7 (96)
   - Allocate items 1 and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation items: 5 (86), 7 (90)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (since item 7 is already allocated).

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0, 4, and 6 are left unallocated.
   - Based on remaining preferences:
     - Agent 0 gets item 0 (valued at 19).
     - Agent 1 gets item 4 (valued at 34).
     - Agent 2 gets item 6 (valued at 18).

This allocation attempts to balance preferences while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of highly valued items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, while also ensuring that all 8 items are distributed.
