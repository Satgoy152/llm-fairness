Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  76  39  35  88  98  98  98
1  29  61  97  14  28  66  23  23
2   4  35  82  66  88  57  71  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible, or at least minimize envy. We will use the valuations to guide our allocations, focusing on maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations on items 4, 5, 6, and 7.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 significantly higher than any other item.
   - Agent 2 has a relatively even distribution of value but higher on items 2, 4, and 6.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value for them (97).
   - Assign items 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 0 because of their high valuations (98, 98, 98).
   
3. **Assign Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as they value it equally to Agent 0, but Agent 0 already has high-value items.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they have no high-value items left and it balances their allocation.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the total number of items.

4. **Final Check**:
   - Ensure each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

The resulting allocation aims to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
