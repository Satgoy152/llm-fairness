Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98   6  40  33  79  75  75  26
1  35  56  16  38  54  52  75  50
2  77  52  80  72   8  87  76   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that no agent feels that another agent received a more valuable set of items based on their own valuation.

Let's consider the following steps for allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:** Determine which items each agent values the most and attempt to allocate those items to them if possible.

2. **Ensure each agent receives a fair share:** Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 2-3 items. 

3. **Check for envy-freeness:** Adjust the allocation if one agent feels another agent received a more valuable set of items.

Given these considerations, here is one possible allocation that aims to achieve fairness and minimize envy based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0 and values item 4 significantly.
- **Agent 1** values items 1, 5, and 6 similarly.
- **Agent 2** values items 2, 3, and 5 highly.

Based on these observations, a possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 6, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3, 5

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on each agent's preferences and ensures that each agent receives a fair share.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
