Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  14  80   6  24  10  99  85
1  33  85  69  90  49  35  92  64
2   8  82  53  82  42  51  91  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we'll aim for a division that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while also attempting to ensure envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have three agents and eight items, we need to allocate the items in a manner that is as fair as possible.

We can use an approach where we start by identifying the item that each agent values the most and attempt to allocate it to them, while also considering the overall distribution of items to ensure fairness.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the highest (99) and item 0 (91). We'll assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest (90) and item 1 (85). We'll assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the highest (86) and item 2 (53). We'll assign these items to Agent 2.

Now, we have items 4 and 5 left to allocate:

- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (49), so we'll assign it to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it more (51) compared to Agent 1 (35) and Agent 0 (10), so we'll assign it to Agent 2.

With this allocation, we distribute the items as fairly as possible based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that they value highly, attempting to minimize envy and ensure fairness.
