Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  15  72  77  35  67  98  88
1  54  40  15  31  53  70  88  83
2  10  22  70  33  93  42   2  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [10 22 70 33 93 42  2 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible, where each agent prefers their own bundle of items over that of any other agent. This is often challenging to achieve perfectly, but we can attempt to minimize envy and ensure a fair division based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 has relatively balanced values but is particularly interested in items 5 and 6.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 and has moderate interest in items 2 and 7.

We need to allocate all 8 items fairly among the 3 agents. A possible approach to achieve a fair division is to assign each agent a roughly equal total valuation by considering their preferences.

Here's one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, and 7 (Values: 52 + 72 + 88 = 212)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5, and 6 (Values: 40 + 70 + 88 = 198)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 4 (Values: 33 + 93 = 126)

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution of total values:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 212
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 198
- Total valuation for Agent 2: 126

While this allocation is not perfectly envy-free, it attempts to balance the total values each agent receives, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
