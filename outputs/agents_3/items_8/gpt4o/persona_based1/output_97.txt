Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  60  91  80  36   2   4  95
1  91   5  16   0  59  86  14   8
2  56  62  75  90   6  17  50  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness, typically striving for envy-freeness or proportionality. Given the differences in valuations, a practical approach is to use an allocation method like the "round-robin" or "maximin share" approach to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent Preferences**: Identify each agent's top preferences based on their valuations.
2. **Round-Robin Allocation**: Assign items to agents in a round-robin fashion based on their highest valuations that have not been allocated yet.

### Item Valuations

**Agent 0's Valuations**:  
- Highest to lowest: 7 (95), 2 (91), 3 (80), 1 (60), 4 (36), 0 (9), 6 (4), 5 (2)

**Agent 1's Valuations**:  
- Highest to lowest: 0 (91), 5 (86), 4 (59), 2 (16), 6 (14), 7 (8), 1 (5), 3 (0)

**Agent 2's Valuations**:  
- Highest to lowest: 3 (90), 2 (75), 7 (86), 1 (62), 0 (56), 6 (50), 5 (17), 4 (6)

### Allocation Process

1. **First Round**: Each agent picks their top preference.
   - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 95).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 91).
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 90).

2. **Second Round**: Continue with the next top available preference.
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 91).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 86).
   - Agent 2 picks item 7 (already taken by Agent 0), so Agent 2 picks item 2 (already taken by Agent 0), next best is item 1 (value 62).

3. **Third Round**: Continue with the next top available preference.
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (already taken by Agent 2), next best is item 3 (already taken by Agent 2), next is item 4 (value 36).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (already taken by Agent 0), next best is item 6 (value 14).
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (already taken by Agent 1), next best is item 6 (already taken by Agent 1), next is item 5 (value 17).

4. **Final Item (item 5)**: Allocated to the agent with the least total value so far.
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (already taken by Agent 1), next best is item 6 (already taken by Agent 1), assign remaining item to Agent 2.

### Allocations

After going through the process, we have:

- **Agent 0**: Items 7, 2, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 1, 6

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and ensures that all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 1, 6]
}
```
