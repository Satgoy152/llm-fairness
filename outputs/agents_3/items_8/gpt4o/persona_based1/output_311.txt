Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  37  23  89  50  41  16  17
1  97  90  54  99  90  31  15  74
2  14  54  57  79  65   2   5  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly with respect to their valuations, we want to ensure that the distribution maximizes the perceived fairness and possibly minimizes envy. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities (valuations) each agent derives from their allocated items.

Given the valuations matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 87     | 37     | 23     | 89     | 50     | 41     | 16     | 17     |
| 1     | 97     | 90     | 54     | 99     | 90     | 31     | 15     | 74     |
| 2     | 14     | 54     | 57     | 79     | 65     | 2      | 5      | 78     |

To find a fair allocation, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Assign items to maximize each agent's minimum gain** while ensuring each agent gets at least two items, as 8 items need to be allocated. This balanced approach prevents any agent from being completely deprived of items they value.

2. **Iterate through potential allocations** and calculate the Nash welfare to determine the most balanced allocation.

Upon going through these steps, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 0, 5, and 6 to agent 0, who values them at 87, 41, and 16, respectively.
- Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to agent 1, who values them at 90, 99, and 90, respectively.
- Assign items 2 and 7 to agent 2, who values them at 57 and 78, respectively.

This allocation seeks to balance the total valuation each agent gets, helping ensure a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
