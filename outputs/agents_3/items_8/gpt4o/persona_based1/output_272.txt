Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  80  45  90  30  42  14  17
1  66  69  18  98  63  88  93  13
2  76  51  98  91  54  22   3   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive, ensuring that no agent feels that another agent has received a more valuable set of items than they have. Given the valuations matrix, we should consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving an allocation:

1. **Identify the preferences**: We start by listing each agent's valuation for each item.
   
2. **Distribute high-value items**: Allocate items with the highest individual valuations to agents who value them the most.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Confirm that all 8 items are distributed among the three agents.

4. **Check for envy**: Verify if any agent would prefer the set of items allocated to another agent. If so, adjust the distribution to minimize envy.

Given these principles, let's start allocating:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Values item 3 highly (90). We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
  - Values item 1 highly (80). We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Values item 6 highly (93). We allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
  - Values item 5 highly (88). We allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Values item 2 highly (98). We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
  - Values item 0 highly (76). We allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
  
Now, we have allocated 6 items. Let's distribute the remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

- **Remaining Items**: 4, 7
  - Agent 1 values item 4 (63), which is relatively higher than the other agents' valuations, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 0 values item 7 (17) more than others, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Letâ€™s check the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 1, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [6, 5, 4]
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 0]

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 7],
    "1": [6, 5, 4],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's valuations while distributing all items.
