Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  49  75  38  46  31  54  74
1  70  74  98  81  59  45  62  93
2   8  10  51  93  25  14  82  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 74 98 81 59 45 62 93]
 [ 8 10 51 93 25 14 82 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that no agent feels another has a better allocation, considering their own valuations. The goal is to minimize envy and distribute items fairly based on the given valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify Valuation Patterns**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (93).

2. **Initial High Value Allocations**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 can be given item 1 (49) and item 5 (31), as these are relatively high in their valuation.
   - Agent 1 can be given item 4 (59) and item 7 (93), as these are also valued highly by them.
   - Agent 2 can be given item 6 (82), which is their second highest valued item.

4. **Check Total Allocations**:  
   We have allocated all 8 items:  
   - Agent 0 has items: 0, 1, 5
   - Agent 1 has items: 2, 4, 7
   - Agent 2 has items: 3, 6

5. **Ensure Envy-Minimization**:  
   Each agent has received items they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations, aiming to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.
