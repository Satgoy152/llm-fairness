Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   9  85  47  25  54  92  96
1  91  60  61  25  81  73  38  57
2  36  12  43  72  58  84  13  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [36 12 43 72 58 84 13 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can employ a strategy that balances the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a round-robin allocation based on the highest unallocated value for each agent.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. Create a list of items with their valuations for each agent.
2. Allocate the items one by one, each time selecting the item that provides the highest value to the agent whose turn it is to choose, proceeding in a round-robin fashion.

First, let's look at the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest values: item 7 (96), item 6 (92), item 0 (91)
- Agent 1's highest values: item 0 (91), item 4 (81), item 5 (73)
- Agent 2's highest values: item 5 (84), item 3 (72), item 4 (58)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 takes item 7 (value 96).
2. Agent 1 takes item 0 (value 91).
3. Agent 2 takes item 5 (value 84).
4. Agent 0 takes item 6 (value 92).
5. Agent 1 takes item 4 (value 81).
6. Agent 2 takes item 3 (value 72).
7. Agent 0 takes item 2 (value 85).
8. Agent 1 takes item 1 (value 60).

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, minimizing envy among them.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 2],
    "1": [0, 4, 1],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
