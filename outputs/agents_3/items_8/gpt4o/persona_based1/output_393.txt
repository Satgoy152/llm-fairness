Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   2  53   7   4  83  84  92
1  70  52  52   8  57  16  45  45
2  20  13   3  77  95  68  13  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we need to consider a method that balances the total value each agent receives with respect to their individual valuations. A common approach in fair division is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's start by examining the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 91 + 2 + 53 + 7 + 4 + 83 + 84 + 92 = 416
- Agent 1: 70 + 52 + 52 + 8 + 57 + 16 + 45 + 45 = 345
- Agent 2: 20 + 13 + 3 + 77 + 95 + 68 + 13 + 68 = 357

Now, we will attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent receives as close as possible to their fair share, considering their total valuation.

To distribute the items fairly, let's use a simple heuristic approach:

1. **Agent 0's allocation:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 5, 6, and 7.
   - Assign items: [0, 5, 6, 7]

2. **Agent 1's allocation:**
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 4.
   - Assign items: [1, 4]

3. **Agent 2's allocation:**
   - Agent 2 highly values items 3 and 4, but since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, allocate item 3.
   - Assign items: [2, 3]

Now, let's ensure every item is allocated:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a combination of items that respects their valuations as much as possible, given the constraints. Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
