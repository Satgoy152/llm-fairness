Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89   6  89  57  85  17   2  79
1  29  84  23  27  76  57  97  51
2  82  64  72  50   8  61  42  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll use an approach that attempts to maximize each agent's valuation given their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation process:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 2 the highest (both valued at 89).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (valued at 97).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (valued at 82).

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to agents such that the difference in total valuation is minimized, aiming for envy-freeness.
   - Try to give each agent at least one item they highly value.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Start by giving each agent one of their most valued items to ensure a fair starting point.

   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0 and second-highest for Agent 2, but Agent 0 values it more).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest remaining unassigned item for Agent 2).

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7.

5. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (second-highest unassigned value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest unassigned value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest unassigned value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest unassigned value for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (next highest unassigned value for Agent 0).

6. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 7.
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 6.
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 5.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives some of their highest valued items.

**Final JSON Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
