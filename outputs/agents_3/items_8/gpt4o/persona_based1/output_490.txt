Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  79  13  16  57  97  69  93
1  86  20  99  55  36  71  46  13
2   1  99  42  16  34  42  67  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free, we will aim to distribute the items among the agents so that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocations of the other agents. Given the valuations, it is often challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can attempt to minimize envy.

Here's a strategy we can use for the allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look for items that are significantly more valuable to one agent compared to others. Allocate those items to the respective agent.

2. **Balancing Values:** Try to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent according to their own valuations.

Now, let's analyze the table and make an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: High value on items 1 (79) and 5 (97).
- **Agent 1**: High value on items 2 (99) and 0 (86).
- **Agent 2**: High value on items 1 (99) and 7 (76).

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 5 (97) and 1 (79), which are highly valued by Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 176.

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 (99), 0 (86), and 4 (36), which are highly valued by Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total valuation of 221.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 7 (76), 6 (67), and 3 (16), which are highly valued by Agent 2. This gives Agent 2 a total valuation of 159.

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent has for the items they receive, though it may not achieve perfect envy-freeness.
