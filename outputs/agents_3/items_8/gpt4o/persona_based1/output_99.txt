Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  86  40  23  46  28  44  36
1  74  87  61  35  72  50  94   2
2  67  47  33  57  93  35   7  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. We will use a method that considers each agent's preferences by assigning items that maximize their satisfaction.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items and attempt to distribute items to balance these total values as closely as possible:

1. **Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 70 + 86 + 40 + 23 + 46 + 28 + 44 + 36 = 373
   - Agent 1: 74 + 87 + 61 + 35 + 72 + 50 + 94 + 2 = 475
   - Agent 2: 67 + 47 + 33 + 57 + 93 + 35 + 7 + 27 = 366

2. **Allocate Items:**
   We will start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most in decreasing order of their valuation.

   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (94). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (93). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 second highest (87). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (70). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 next highest (61). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 next highest (57). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 next highest (28). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 7 next highest (36). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   Each agent should have a fair share considering their valuations. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high personal value and attempts to balance the total value across agents.
