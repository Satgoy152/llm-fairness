Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65   5   2  44   9  49  88  83
1   7  11  11   5  96  93  29  92
2  26  45   0  56  72  58  72  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with integer allocations, we aim to get as close as possible to this ideal.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 (88) and item 7 (83) the most.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (96), item 5 (93), and item 7 (92) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (56), item 4 (72), item 5 (58), and item 6 (72) highly.

Considering these preferences and aiming for fairness and envy minimization, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 0. These are the items they value highly.
- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 1. These items are among the highest in value for Agent 1.
- Assign items 3 and 6 to Agent 2. These items are relatively high in value for Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 1 and 2:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2. Agent 2 values it more than the others.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1. Agent 1 and Agent 0 both value it similarly low, but assigning it to Agent 1 balances item count better.

The resulting allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the agents' preferences and aims to distribute the items fairly, though not perfectly envy-free.
