Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  23  89  64  28  38  60  19
1  82  20  39  66  88  73  97   2
2  47   6  61   9  10  13  60  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 23 89 64 28 38 60 19]
 [82 20 39 66 88 73 97  2]
 [47  6 61  9 10 13 60 49]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should ideally aim for an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agents\Items  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
-----------------------------------------
0            91  23  89  64  28  38  60  19
1            82  20  39  66  88  73  97   2
2            47   6  61   9  10  13  60  49
```

Let's try to allocate the items in a manner that each agent receives items such that their total valuation is maximized while aiming for fairness.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 2. Let's allocate these to Agent 0.
   - Allocation: Items [0, 2]
   - Total value: 91 + 89 = 180

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 6 (97) and item 4 (88). Let's allocate these to Agent 1.
   - Allocation: Items [6, 4]
   - Total value: 97 + 88 = 185

3. **Remaining items**: Items 1, 3, 5, and 7 are left.

4. **Agent 0**: Already has items 0 and 2. Their next highest value is item 3 (64). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocation: Items [0, 2, 3]
   - Total value: 180 + 64 = 244

5. **Agent 1**: Already has items 6 and 4. Their next highest value is item 5 (73). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Allocation: Items [6, 4, 5]
   - Total value: 185 + 73 = 258

6. **Agent 2**: Remaining items 1 and 7 are allocated to Agent 2.
   - Allocation: Items [1, 7]
   - Total value: 6 + 49 = 55

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and we aimed to distribute the items based on the values in a fair manner.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [6, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

Each agent has received items, and all 8 items are allocated.
