Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  43  73  81  82   5  16  16
1   3  13  14  85   1  93  46  60
2  24  52  34  68  86  93  51  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation, if possible. 

Let's briefly analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (82) followed by item 3 (81).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (93) followed by item 3 (85).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (93) followed by item 4 (86).

A straightforward approach is to try to allocate each agent's highest-valued item to them, but we must ensure each agent gets a fair share overall. We can use a round-robin approach, starting by allocating the highest available valued item to each agent and then proceeding to the next highest until all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (as it is their highest value).
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (as it is their second highest value after item 5).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (as it is their second highest value after item 4).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (as it is their highest remaining value).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (as it is their highest remaining value after items 4 and 5).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (as it is their highest remaining value).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (as it is their highest remaining value).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (as it is their remaining highest value).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here is the json format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4, 1, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 1, and 6.

This allocation attempts to be fair by considering the agents' preferences and distributing their highest valued items to them while ensuring all items are allocated.
