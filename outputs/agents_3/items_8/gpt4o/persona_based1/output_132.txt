Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  41  42  58   7  24  18  81
1  58  30  25  43  51  52  48  45
2  53  46  33  38  30  30  99  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and efficient allocation. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. Here, we aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

To start, we calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 64 + 41 + 42 + 58 + 7 + 24 + 18 + 81 = 335
- Agent 1: 58 + 30 + 25 + 43 + 51 + 52 + 48 + 45 = 352
- Agent 2: 53 + 46 + 33 + 38 + 30 + 30 + 99 + 46 = 375

Since each agent's valuation total is different, we must allocate in a way that is proportional to their preferences.

A potential allocation strategy is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another. Here's an allocation that aims to be fair based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 3, 7
   - Total Valuation: 64 + 58 + 81 = 203

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 4, 5
   - Total Valuation: 30 + 51 + 52 = 133

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 6
   - Total Valuation: 33 + 99 = 132

Let's ensure that all items are allocated and that this allocation is fair:

- Agent 0 receives the items with the highest valuations from their perspective.
- Agent 1 receives middling items, but still valuable to them.
- Agent 2, who values item 6 highly, receives it, minimizing envy.

This allocation is designed to be as fair as possible given the constraints.

Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
