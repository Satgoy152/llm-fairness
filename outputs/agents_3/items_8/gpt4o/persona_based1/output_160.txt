Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  75  99  27  62  82  47  79
1  49  72  59  85  36  58  52  68
2  55  27   9   5  28  84  49   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 27  9  5 28 84 49  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation that attempts to minimize envy among the agents. This can be done by trying to balance the total valuations each agent receives from their allocated items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Agent 0: \(6 + 75 + 99 + 27 + 62 + 82 + 47 + 79 = 477\)
   - Agent 1: \(49 + 72 + 59 + 85 + 36 + 58 + 52 + 68 = 479\)
   - Agent 2: \(55 + 27 + 9 + 5 + 28 + 84 + 49 + 4 = 261\)

2. **Calculate the proportional fair share for each agent**:
   - Given there are 8 items, ideally we want each agent to have total valuations as close as possible to one-third of the total value of all items.
   - Total value of all items: \(477 + 479 + 261 = 1217\)
   - Proportional fair share per agent: \(1217 / 3 \approx 405.67\)

3. **Allocate items to balance valuations**:
   - Aim to allocate items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as close as possible to 405.67 and minimize envy.

4. **Perform item allocation**:

   After considering various allocations, we aim to distribute the items to get as close as possible to the ideal distribution while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

   Here's a fair allocation:

   - **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2, 7]
     - Total valuation: \(75 + 99 + 79 = 253\)

   - **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3, 5]
     - Total valuation: \(49 + 85 + 58 = 192\)

   - **Agent 2**: Items [4, 6]
     - Total valuation: \(28 + 49 = 77\)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives and is done in a way to minimize envy. Note that it's challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness and equal distribution simultaneously due to the integer nature of allocations and differing valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
