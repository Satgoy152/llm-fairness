Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  22  50  96  72  26  85  58
1  42  90  45  18   4   6  26  63
2  19  55  24  36  21  54  40  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One approach to achieving fairness is to ensure that the allocation minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given this is a small problem size, a direct approach can be taken to find a satisfactory allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly at: 3 (96), 6 (85), and 4 (72).
- Agent 1 values items highly at: 1 (90), 7 (63), and 0 (42).
- Agent 2 values items highly at: 1 (55), 5 (54), and 7 (44).

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to give each agent items they value highly while also ensuring that the total perceived value is somewhat balanced among the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3, allocate item 3 to Agent 0. Next, allocate item 6, as it's Agent 0's second highest valued item. Lastly, allocate item 4, which is also highly valued by Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 first, as it is highly valued by Agent 1. Then allocate item 7, as it's the next highest value for Agent 1. Lastly, allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 first, as it's one of the highest valued items for Agent 2. Then allocate item 2, as it hasn't been allocated yet.

After assigning in this manner, we have allocated all 8 items. The allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 6, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 7, 0
- Agent 2 receives items: 5, 2

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 4],
    "1": [1, 7, 0],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and ensures each agent receives items they value to some degree.
