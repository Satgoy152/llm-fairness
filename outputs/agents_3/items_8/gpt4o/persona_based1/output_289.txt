Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  92  20  14  48  36  55  29
1  68  32   7  93  75  40  52  40
2  22  93  14  34  60  90  71   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, I'll aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Per Agent**: Each agent should ideally get some of the items they value the most.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuations**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

3. **Balance the Number of Items**: Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, some agents will receive 3 items while others receive 2. We'll adjust allocations to ensure item count balance.

4. **Check for Envy**: After initial allocation, adjust items to minimize envy. This might mean swapping items between agents to ensure each agent's allocation is as close to envy-free as possible.

**Initial Allocation Proposal**:
- Agent 0: Items 1 and 6 (valued at 92 and 55)
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4 (valued at 93 and 75)
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 2 (valued at 90 and 14)

**Balancing and Minimizing Envy**:
- Agent 0 has 2 items, Agent 1 has 2 items, Agent 2 has 2 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.
- Agent 0 values item 0 next highest; allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 7 higher than Agent 1 does, allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations and attempts to minimize envy among the agents.

{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
