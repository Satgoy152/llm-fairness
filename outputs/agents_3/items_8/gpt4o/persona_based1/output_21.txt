Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  27  16   5  53  10  47  65
1  57  81  30   4  42  70  94  15
2   9  66  17  34  50  19  76  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 81 30  4 42 70 94 15]
 [ 9 66 17 34 50 19 76 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocation. This method is known for providing fair and efficient allocations.

Given the valuations for each agent and item from the table, let's determine an allocation that maximizes fairness:

### Valuation Table
```
Agent/Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
-----------|-------------------------------
Agent 0    | 31  27  16   5  53  10  47  65
Agent 1    | 57  81  30   4  42  70  94  15
Agent 2    |  9  66  17  34  50  19  76  50
```

### Steps and Allocation
1. **Identify High Value Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 places high value on items: 4 (53), 7 (65), 6 (47)
   - Agent 1 places high value on items: 1 (81), 6 (94), 5 (70)
   - Agent 2 places high value on items: 6 (76), 1 (66), 4 (50), 7 (50)

2. **Fair Distribution Strategy:**
   - Prioritize items based on each agent's highest valuations while avoiding overlaps as much as possible.
   - Use a balanced approach to ensure each agent receives a fair value in their allocation.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0 has high preferences for items 4, 7, and 6 but will miss out on item 6 due to higher claims by other agents.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most and also highly values item 6; they will get those high-value items.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 and 1 highly, but will be allocated based on secondary high preferences due to competition for these items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign items to balance the total value each agent receives as fairly as possible while respecting individual preferences.

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy and maximizing fairness.
