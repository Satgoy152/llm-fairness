Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  60  12  13   9  19  41  28
1  17  31  71  67  66  68  91  97
2  19  42  76  12  88  19  40  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 31 71 67 66 68 91 97]
 [19 42 76 12 88 19 40 26]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Here, we will try to ensure that each agent feels they have received items that maximize their utility while minimizing envy towards the allocations of other agents.

The valuations given are:

- Agent 0: [6, 60, 12, 13, 9, 19, 41, 28]
- Agent 1: [17, 31, 71, 67, 66, 68, 91, 97]
- Agent 2: [19, 42, 76, 12, 88, 19, 40, 26]

A potential approach is to use a method such as the "sequential allocation" or "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item.

Let's go through an example allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation overall (item 7 with value 97). They pick item 7.
2. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation (item 4 with value 88). They pick item 4.
3. **Agent 1** then picks item 6 (value 91).
4. **Agent 2** picks item 2 (value 76).
5. **Agent 1** picks item 5 (value 68).
6. **Agent 2** picks item 1 (value 42).
7. **Agent 0** finally gets to pick and chooses item 3 (value 13).
8. **Agent 0** picks item 0 (value 6).

This allocation strategy leads to the following distribution of items:

- Agent 0: [3, 0]
- Agent 1: [7, 6, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 2, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here is the resulting allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [7, 6, 5],
    "2": [4, 2, 1]
}
```
