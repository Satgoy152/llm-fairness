Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  69  88  75  71  18  98  57
1  43  31  25  23   5  82  11  61
2  45  30  13   4  16  87  94   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 69 88 75 71 18 98 57]
 [43 31 25 23  5 82 11 61]
 [45 30 13  4 16 87 94  9]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach to minimize envy and aim for an equitable distribution based on the agents' valuations.

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 99 + 69 + 88 + 75 + 71 + 18 + 98 + 57 = 575
   - Agent 1: 43 + 31 + 25 + 23 + 5 + 82 + 11 + 61 = 281
   - Agent 2: 45 + 30 + 13 + 4 + 16 + 87 + 94 + 9 = 298

2. **Determine Fair Share:**
   - Fair share for each agent is the total value divided by the number of agents. Total value of all items is 1154.
   - Fair share per agent = 1154 / 3 â‰ˆ 384.67

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent until their fair share is reached or approximated.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Valuation: 99 (item 0), 98 (item 6), 88 (item 2), 75 (item 3)
  - Selected items: [0, 6, 2] 
  - Total value: 99 + 98 + 88 = 285 (still below fair share, but no more high-value items available)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Valuation: 82 (item 5), 61 (item 7), 43 (item 0)
  - Selected items: [5, 7]
  - Total value: 82 + 61 = 143 (maximized with high value items)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Valuation: 94 (item 6), 87 (item 5), 45 (item 0)
  - Selected items: [1, 3, 4]
  - Total value: 30 + 4 + 16 = 50 (maximized with remaining items)

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items in a manner that provides each agent with items that maximize their valuations, while distributing the total valuation as evenly as possible, given the constraints.
