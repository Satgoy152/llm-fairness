Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  94  48  25  19  21  98   5
1  96  41  56  62  30  37  18  97
2  80  31  49  53  14  64  67   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
Fair division in this context involves allocating items to agents in such a way that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. The challenge is to ensure each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their individual valuations.

Let's first review the given valuations for each item by the agents:

- Agent 0: [57, 94, 48, 25, 19, 21, 98, 5]
- Agent 1: [96, 41, 56, 62, 30, 37, 18, 97]
- Agent 2: [80, 31, 49, 53, 14, 64, 67, 5]

The goal is to allocate these items to the three agents in a way that is as fair as possible. A common strategy is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the distribution remains balanced. This often involves considering both the total value each agent receives and the individual preferences for specific high-value items.

One possible allocation approach is as follows:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued items first, if possible, without creating conflicts.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuations among the agents.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (94) and item 6 (98).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (96) and item 7 (97).
- **Agent 2** values item 5 (64) and item 6 (67) relatively highly, but item 6 is more valued by Agent 0.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (94) and item 6 (98).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (96) and item 7 (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (64).

Now, distribute the remaining items considering the value and balance:

- Remaining items are 2, 3, and 4.

We'll attempt to balance the totals:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (25).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (56).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (14).

This distribution gives us the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly and that the distribution is reasonably balanced given the constraints.
