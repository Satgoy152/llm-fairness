Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  17  61  64  63  85  67  93
1  16  83  73  19  68  79  85  46
2  22  45   5  85  64  51  64  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division of items where no agent envies another's allocation. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one approach is to ensure each agent receives roughly the same total value, minimizing envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the table and create a simple allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (93), Item 0 (91), and Item 5 (85).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (83), Item 6 (85), and Item 5 (79).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (85), Item 4 (64), and Item 6 (64).

To fairly allocate, we can prioritize giving each agent one of their highest valued items, then balance the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 7 (valued 91, 93)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 6 (valued 83, 85)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4, 2, 5 (valued 85, 64, 5, 51)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while keeping the distribution simple and straightforward.
