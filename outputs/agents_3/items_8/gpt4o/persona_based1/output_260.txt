Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  49  29  54  23   7  75  49
1  25  96   8  26  87  77   6  44
2  98  74  74  43  60   3  28  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 96  8 26 87 77  6 44]
 [98 74 74 43 60  3 28 60]]
Output:
To ensure fair division and aim for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while considering the constraints. We will aim to balance allocations such that no agent envies another.

Given the valuations provided, a possible allocation strategy would be:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and allocate these preferentially, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives close to an equal number of items (given there are 8 items and 3 agents, one will receive 3 items and the others 2 each).

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (75), so allocate it to them.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (96), so allocate it to them.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (98), so allocate it to them.

Now, allocate remaining items:

- Agent 0 could also benefit from item 3 (54), which is the next highest for them after item 6.
- Agent 1 values items 4 (87) next after item 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (74) next after item 0.

Distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0 gets item 7 (49), which they value more than other remaining items.
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (77), which they value more than agent 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (3), which they value less than agent 1, but item 5 is already assigned to Agent 1. So, they get item 5.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 6, 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
