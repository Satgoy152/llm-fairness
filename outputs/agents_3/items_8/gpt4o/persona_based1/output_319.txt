Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  86  37  28  46  67  51  53
1  73   4  10  49  85  61  27  18
2  77  83  37   0  13  85  71  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of these items among the three agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) criterion, meaning that each agent will not envy another agent's allocation if at most one item is removed from the other agent's bundle.

Let's begin by examining the valuations and attempting to allocate the items such that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their highest valued items, while keeping the distribution envy-free.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 (88) and 1 (86), so let's prioritize giving them these items. 

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 (85) the highest, so we'll assign it to them. 

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 (85) the highest, so we'll initially assign it to them.

Now, let's see how we can distribute the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 (51), which is among their higher valuations.

5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (49), which is their second-highest remaining valuation.

6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 7 (34), which is one of the higher remaining valuations for Agent 2.

We have now allocated six items, so let's allocate the remaining two items:

7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (37), which is the highest remaining valuation for Agent 0.

8. **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (83), which is the second-highest remaining valuation for Agent 2 and provides a strong allocation relative to their other items.

This distribution is fair as each agent receives items closer to their highest preferences without violating the EF1 criterion.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures that no agent envies another significantly, meeting the EF1 criterion.
