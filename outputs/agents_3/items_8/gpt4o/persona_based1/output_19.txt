Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  95  96  33  60  25  30  83
1   5  54  40  12  12  50  31   6
2  18  59  70  22  70  22  55  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 54 40 12 12 50 31  6]
 [18 59 70 22 70 22 55 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives a collection of items that maximizes their individual valuations while attempting to maintain a sense of fairness and reduce envy. We will use a heuristic approach to approximate an envy-free allocation as closely as possible, considering the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive.

### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Valuations
Let's summarize the total valuation each agent places on all items:
- Agent 0: Total valuation = 10 + 95 + 96 + 33 + 60 + 25 + 30 + 83 = 432
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 5 + 54 + 40 + 12 + 12 + 50 + 31 + 6 = 210
- Agent 2: Total valuation = 18 + 59 + 70 + 22 + 70 + 22 + 55 + 99 = 415

### Step 2: Allocation Strategy
We will allocate items to agents based on their highest individual valuations to try to ensure that each agent maximizes their satisfaction with the allocation. We'll proceed by assigning items starting with the highest valuations and checking for conflicts (i.e., if two agents both highly value the same item).

### Step 3: Item-by-Item Allocation
1. **Item 2**: Valued most by Agent 0 (96), allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 7**: Valued most by Agent 2 (99), allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1**: Valued most by Agent 0 (95), allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 6**: Valued most by Agent 2 (55), allocate to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Valued most by Agent 2 (70), allocate to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Valued most by Agent 1 (50), allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 0**: Valued by Agent 2 (18) more than others, allocate to Agent 2.
8. **Item 3**: Valued by Agent 0 (33) more than others, allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation
The final allocation should ensure that all items are allocated and that agents receive items according to their highest preferences where possible. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items.
