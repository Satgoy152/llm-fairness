Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  46  32  25  59  25  83  71
1  76  81  26  71  89   8  58  63
2  84  66  21   0  77  13   3  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The challenge is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their own valuations.

Let's analyze a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the highest at 83, followed by item 7 at 71. Giving these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest at 89, followed by item 1 at 81. These items should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest at 84, followed by item 4 at 77, but item 4 is already allocated. The next highest available item is item 1 at 66, but item 1 is allocated to Agent 1. The next available high-value item is item 7 at 51, but item 7 is allocated to Agent 0. So, we need to adjust.

Revisiting allocation for more balance:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 6 and 3, with values 83 and 25, respectively.
  
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 4 and 1, with values 89 and 81, respectively.
  
- **Agent 2**: Receives items 0, 2, 5, and 7, with values 84, 21, 13, and 51, respectively.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a manner that considers the highest valuations first while trying to keep envy to a minimum.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items according to their valuations, with the total number of items allocated being 8.
