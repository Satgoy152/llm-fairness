Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  74  54  95  96  56  92  76
1  23  54  43   3  53  66  35   1
2  27  40  47  82  66  80  76  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuation matrix, let's attempt to allocate the items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  74  54  95  96  56  92  76
1  23  54  43   3  53  66  35   1
2  27  40  47  82  66  80  76  73
```

A practical approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, 4, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has moderate valuations for items 1, 5, and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5, 6, 3, and 7.

Considering these observations, we proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (higher value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (higher value for Agent 2 compared to Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it highly, and Agent 0 and 1 have lower valuations).

This allocation attempts to balance the interests of each agent while considering their preferences. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items according to their preferences, attempting to minimize envy among agents.
