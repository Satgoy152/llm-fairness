Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  84  21  56  84   9  92  17
1  61  63  72  95  28   0  34  74
2  18  72  28  39  75  82  71  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 63 72 95 28  0 34 74]
 [18 72 28 39 75 82 71 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the three agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives a whole number of items. Given the valuations provided, we aim to distribute the eight items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assess Total Valuation:** Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to get a sense of their relative preferences.

   - Agent 0: 85 + 84 + 21 + 56 + 84 + 9 + 92 + 17 = 448
   - Agent 1: 61 + 63 + 72 + 95 + 28 + 0 + 34 + 74 = 427
   - Agent 2: 18 + 72 + 28 + 39 + 75 + 82 + 71 + 91 = 476

2. **Determine Initial Allocations:** Prioritize items to each agent based on their highest valuation differences to ensure each agent gets at least one high-valued item.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:** Adjust the allocation to balance the envy-free condition where possible.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** They highly value items 0 and 6. Assign items to maximize their perceived value.
- **Agent 1:** They highly value items 3 and 2. Assign these items to them.
- **Agent 2:** They highly value items 7 and 5. Assign these items to them.

4. **Final Adjustments:** Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed. Ensure no agent feels envious based on their valuation.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 6
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 3, 4
- **Agent 2:** Items 5, 7

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations, minimizing envy and ensuring everyone receives a fair share of the total value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```
