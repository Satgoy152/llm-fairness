Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  49  9   9  84  12  18  90
1  10  95  9  34  66  22  12  77
2  19  79  5  89  29  38  45  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent feels another has a better deal.

One method to achieve a fair division is to use the "maximum envy-free" approach, where we allocate items to minimize the maximum envy experienced by any agent. In this context, "envy" can be thought of as the difference between what an agent values their own allocation and what they value another agent's allocation.

Given that we have three agents and eight items, one possible way to achieve a fair allocation is as follows:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 7 (value 90) and item 4 (value 84).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 95) and item 7 (value 77).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (value 89) and item 1 (value 79).

To minimize envy, we can allocate items based on a balance of these high valuations, ensuring each agent receives items that they value highly relative to others:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 6, 7] (values: 84, 18, 90)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2, 5] (values: 95, 9, 22)
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 3] (values: 19, 89)

This allocation aims to give each agent items that they value highly while balancing overall envy among the agents. It is important to check that each agent receives items such that the total value they perceive isn't significantly lower than what they perceive others to have received. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
