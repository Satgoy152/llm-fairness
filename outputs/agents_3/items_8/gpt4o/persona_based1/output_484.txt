Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  30  95   9  39  87  10  28
1  16  62  34  90   7  70  23  82
2  94  20  99   7  79  16  16  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 30 95  9 39 87 10 28]
 [16 62 34 90  7 70 23 82]
 [94 20 99  7 79 16 16 20]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to achieve a division where the allocation is as envy-free and fair as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers someone else’s allocation to their own. Given the nature of the problem, achieving a perfectly envy-free allocation might not be possible, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [8, 30, 95, 9, 39, 87, 10, 28]
Agent 1: [16, 62, 34, 90, 7, 70, 23, 82]
Agent 2: [94, 20, 99, 7, 79, 16, 16, 20]
```

To ensure fairness and attempt to minimize envy:
1. Assign the highest-valued items to each agent, if possible.
2. Balance the total value of items each agent receives.

A potential allocation strategy:
- Assign items to agents according to their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.
- Balance the total valuation of each agent's allocated items to ensure fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:
- Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 7.
- Agent 2 highly values items 0 and 4.

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

Since this only allocates 6 items, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 6. We can assign them to balance the total value across agents:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent under this allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 6 → Values: 95, 87, 10 → Total: 192
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7, 1 → Values: 90, 82, 62 → Total: 234
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4 → Values: 94, 79 → Total: 173

This allocation distributes the items fairly while minimizing envy as much as possible. Here is the representation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7, 1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
