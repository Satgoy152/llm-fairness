Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  49  76  77   5  57  38  11
1  57   0  90  88  90  38  45  85
2  86  37  32  75  83  32  29  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach that considers each agent's valuations and tries to maximize their individual satisfaction. One common method is using the Envy-Free Allocation algorithm, which attempts to distribute items such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table, we can attempt a heuristic method to distribute the items fairly:

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0:  [24, 49, 76, 77, 5, 57, 38, 11]
Agent 1:  [57, 0, 90, 88, 90, 38, 45, 85]
Agent 2:  [86, 37, 32, 75, 83, 32, 29, 71]
```

One possible allocation could be:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest preferences while balancing the total number of items allocated.

   - **Agent 0**: Their highest valuations are for items 3 (77) and 2 (76). 
   - **Agent 1**: Their highest valuations are for items 2 (90) and 4 (90). However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we choose the next highest available which are items 3 (88) and 7 (85).
   - **Agent 2**: Their highest valuations are for items 0 (86) and 4 (83). However, item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we choose the next highest available which is item 0 (86).

2. Distribute remaining items based on next highest valuations while maintaining balance:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (49), item 5 to Agent 1 (38), and item 6 to Agent 2 (29).

This way, each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences and the number of items allocated to each remains balanced.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [4, 7, 5],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to balance the allocation fairly among all agents.
