Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  84  60  53  49  14  28  88
1  47  84  27  36  13  22  40   8
2  36   6   1  66  49  44  77  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total utility for each agent, while trying to balance the allocations to minimize envy. Given the constraints and the valuations provided, we can proceed with the following allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the Highest Valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (value 88)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 84)
   - Agent 2: Item 6 (value 77)

2. **Assign These Items First:**
   - Agent 0: Item 7
   - Agent 1: Item 1
   - Agent 2: Item 6

3. **Distribute Remaining Items Based on Highest Value:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Assign the remaining items to maximize each agent's total value while attempting to keep the allocations close in total value.

    - Agent 0: Items 0, 3
    - Agent 1: Items 2, 4
    - Agent 2: Item 5

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value, and the total value of items received is balanced among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items and ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, contributing to a fair division with minimized envy.
