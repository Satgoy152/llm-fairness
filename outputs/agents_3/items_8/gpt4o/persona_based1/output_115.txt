Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  75  35  48  90  78  30  93
1  97  21  76   0  91  21  92  42
2  79  91  67  44  35  91  30  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 75 35 48 90 78 30 93]
 [97 21 76  0 91 21 92 42]
 [79 91 67 44 35 91 30 31]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's find a fair allocation.

We need to allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents. Since there are 3 agents and 8 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the other two agents will receive 3 items each.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 92 + 75 + 35 + 48 + 90 + 78 + 30 + 93 = 541
   - Agent 1: 97 + 21 + 76 + 0 + 91 + 21 + 92 + 42 = 440
   - Agent 2: 79 + 91 + 67 + 44 + 35 + 91 + 30 + 31 = 468

2. **Initial Allocation based on Individual High Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 7 (93).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (97).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1 (91).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - After assigning these high-value items, we continue by considering the remaining items and aim to balance the allocations by considering each agent's next highest-valued items.

4. **Iterative Assignment:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 90) to maximize their total value.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 92) to maximize their total value.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 91) to maximize their total value.
  
5. **Final Allocations:**
   - Assign remaining items 2 and 3 to balance the allocations:
     - Item 2 (value 76) to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1).
     - Item 3 (value 48) to Agent 0 (balances the number of items).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 3],
    "1": [0, 6, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items fairly according to the agents' valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items and none of the agents having a clear incentive to swap their allocations for another's, given the constraints.
