Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  26  59  76  88  12  22  98
1   2  51   7   1  40  41  80  62
2  49  74  45  65  71   8  98  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, we can use the method of envy-free allocation. One approach is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential" method where each agent picks their most valued item in turns. 

Let's follow this method to allocate the items:

1. **Round 1:**
   - **Agent 0** picks item 7 (value: 98).
   - **Agent 1** picks item 6 (value: 80).
   - **Agent 2** picks item 6 (already taken, so next highest value is item 0 with value: 49).

2. **Round 2:**
   - **Agent 0** picks item 4 (value: 88).
   - **Agent 1** picks item 5 (value: 41).
   - **Agent 2** picks item 1 (value: 74).

3. **Round 3:**
   - **Agent 0** picks item 3 (value: 76).
   - **Agent 1** picks item 2 (value: 7).
   - **Agent 2** picks item 2 (already taken, so next highest value is item 3 with value: 65).

4. **Round 4:**
   - **Agent 0** picks item 2 (already taken, so next highest value is item 1 with value: 26).
   - **Agent 1** picks item 0 (already taken, so next highest value is item 4 with value: 40).
   - **Agent 2** picks item 5 (already taken, so next highest value is item 5 with value: 8).

After these rounds, we need to ensure each item is allocated exactly once. This method may result in some adjustments and may not be perfect in a single pass. Let's adjust based on maximizing each agent's total value:

Final allocation based on above rounds and ensuring all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 3],
    "1": [6, 5, 2],
    "2": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring that each item is uniquely allocated.
