Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  23  26  38  46  48  54  62
1  79  34  80   7  71  13  44  96
2  15   8  52  58  66  34  64  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 34 80  7 71 13 44 96]
 [15  8 52 58 66 34 64 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (77) and values other items moderately.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (96) and has a strong preference for item 2 (80).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (72) and has moderately high values for items 4, 6, and 3.

Given this, a possible envy-free allocation strategy is to assign items primarily based on the highest valuations per agent, with a secondary consideration of balancing the total number of items each agent receives.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation proposal:

1. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: 7 (96)
   - Second highest valued item: 2 (80)
   - Assign items 7 and 2 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest valued item: 0 (77)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest remaining value: 4 (66)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest valued item: 6 (64)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest valued item: 7 (62) but already allocated.
   - Next highest available: 5 (48)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest valued item: 3 (58)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

7. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining items: 1 and 3
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

8. All items are now allocated with:
   - Agent 0: 0, 1, 5
   - Agent 1: 2, 7
   - Agent 2: 3, 4, 6

Let's ensure the allocations adhere to the constraints and present them in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
