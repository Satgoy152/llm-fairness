Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  43  83  75  46  90  18   8
1   4  10  91  21  79  51  36  56
2  46  99  69  72  56  96  61  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31 43 83 75 46 90 18  8]
 [ 4 10 91 21 79 51 36 56]
 [46 99 69 72 56 96 61 74]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's assigned items. This approach aims to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0           31  43  83  75  46  90  18  8
1            4  10  91  21  79  51  36 56
2           46  99  69  72  56  96  61 74
```

To allocate items fairly, we can use a high-level approach that tries to maximize fairness by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring that no agent envies another. We will try to split the items in a way that maximizes the sum of the assigned values for each agent.

Here's an allocation that achieves this:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 2, 5 (Valuations: 83, 90)
  - Total valuation: 173

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 4, 6, 7 (Valuations: 79, 36, 56)
  - Total valuation: 171

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items: 0, 1, 3 (Valuations: 46, 99, 72)
  - Total valuation: 217

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations fairly across the agents, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
