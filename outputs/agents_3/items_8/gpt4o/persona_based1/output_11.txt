Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  55  91  88  47  58   7  19
1  26  40  16  21  47  12  98  90
2  18   9  64  24  66   1  51  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. This can be challenging, especially with differing preferences, but we can use a strategy to approximate an envy-free allocation. Here, I'll attempt to balance the allocations by considering each agent's valuation and ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair portion based on their individual preferences.

Let's begin analyzing the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a strong preference for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Shows high preference for items 6 and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly, followed by item 7.

We need to ensure each agent receives an approximately equal share of total value, while also considering their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Total value for Agent 0 is 462. We'll aim to allocate the items with higher value to this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Total value for Agent 1 is 350. We'll allocate items they value highly to balance against other agents.
- **Agent 2**: Total value for Agent 2 is 307. We'll allocate items with high value to this agent as well.

Using the above insights, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2, 3]  
  (High preference for 0, 2, and 3)

- **Agent 1**: [6, 7]  
  (High preference for 6 and 7)

- **Agent 2**: [1, 4, 5]  
  (Focus on high-value items for Agent 2)

This allocation tries to balance the total value perceived by each agent based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to distribute items in a way that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences, aiming to minimize envy.
