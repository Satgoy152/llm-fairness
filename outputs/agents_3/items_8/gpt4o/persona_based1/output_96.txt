Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  10   9  65  14  99  98  43
1  40  47  37  32   7   9  49   1
2  63  26  91   0  76  15  96  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to allocate them in a way that maximizes fairness. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion, where no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 5, 6, 3, and 0.
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items 2, 6, 4, and 0.

We need to allocate 8 items among 3 agents, ensuring each agent receives at least some items and trying to keep the allocation as envy-free as possible. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible:

- **Agent 0:** Items 5, 6 (highest-valued items)
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2 (high-valued items for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 4, 3, 7 (reasonable distribution given Agent 2's preferences)

This allocation aims to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated.
