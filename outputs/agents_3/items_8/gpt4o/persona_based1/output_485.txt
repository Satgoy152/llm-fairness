Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   7  98  83  80  73  23  63
1  11  30  81  70  37  93  83  71
2  64  70  87  50  50  52  15  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method maximizes the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocation, which often leads to a fair distribution where agents have no incentive to swap allocations with others.

Let's calculate the allocations step by step:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (98), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 5 (93), so assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 2, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (70), so assign item 1 to agent 2.

Let's continue by finding allocations that maximize the overall satisfaction while considering the remaining items.

4. **Agent 0:** Next highest valuation of remaining items is item 3 (83), assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 1:** Next highest available valuation is item 6 (83), assign item 6 to agent 1.
6. **Agent 2:** Next highest available valuation is item 0 (64), assign item 0 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 0:** Next highest available valuation is item 4 (80), assign item 4 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 1:** Last item available is item 7 (71), assign item 7 to agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation balances the valuations across agents, maximizing their individual utilities and aiming for a fair distribution.
