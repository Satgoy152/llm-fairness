Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  78  16  42  83  38  58  30
1  99  80  98  17  29  45  91  73
2   1  58  70  26  22  81   4  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. One common approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar algorithms, but given the small size of this problem, we can manually allocate the items to achieve a balanced distribution.

First, let's examine the valuations to identify potential allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations on items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations on items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations on items 5, 7, and 2.

Considering these valuations, we aim to distribute items so that each agent receives items that they value highly, while keeping the overall distribution as fair as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0, as they highly value these items.
- Assign items 1, 2, and 6 to Agent 1, as they have high valuations for these items.
- Assign items 5, 7, and 3 to Agent 2, as they value items 5 and 7 highly, and item 3 is a compromise.

This distribution attempts to give each agent items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [5, 7, 3]
}
```

This allocation covers all 8 items and tries to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations.
