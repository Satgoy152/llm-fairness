Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  19   3  95   6  66  85  57
1  82  34  19  97  81  39  69  56
2  96   2  82  36  26  38  28  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96  2 82 36 26 38 28 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. In this context, we'll try to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here’s a possible allocation that aims to balance the total value across agents:

1. Agent 0: Items [1, 5, 6]
2. Agent 1: Items [0, 4]
3. Agent 2: Items [2, 3, 7]

Let's break down the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 (value 19), 5 (value 66), and 6 (value 85). Total value for agent 0: 170.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 (value 82) and 4 (value 81). Total value for agent 1: 163.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 (value 82), 3 (value 36), and 7 (value 76). Total value for agent 2: 194.

Each agent receives multiple items, and the allocations aim to balance the total perceived value each agent receives.

Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
