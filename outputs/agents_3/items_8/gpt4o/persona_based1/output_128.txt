Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  76  91  40  10  44  13  16
1  99  32  55  66  43  65   5  75
2  58  51   9   0  42  32  52   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a difficult problem, especially when agents have different valuations for each item.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  76  91  40  10  44  13  16
1  99  32  55  66  43  65   5  75
2  58  51   9   0  42  32  52   7
```

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share of the total value according to their own valuations.

One approach is to use a round-robin or a bidding approach, but given the small number of items, we can manually optimize the allocation. Let's aim to distribute high-value items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here is one way to allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0.
3. **Agent 2** can be allocated items that are less desired by others but still ensure a fair value to them.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 2. These items have high valuations for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 3. Item 0 is extremely valuable for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4, 5, 6, and 7. These items collectively provide a fair value to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2], total value = 167
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3], total value = 165
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 5, 6, 7], total value = 133

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
