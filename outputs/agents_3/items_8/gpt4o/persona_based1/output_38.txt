Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  92  25  55  21  20  56  54
1  26  26  18  64  65  97  98  95
2  94  13  74  68  49  78  16  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent's allocation is as envy-free as possible, given their valuations. One commonly used approach for fair division is to maximize the minimum utility among all agents, which typically involves ensuring that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

The table of valuations given is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 10     | 92     | 25     | 55     | 21     | 20     | 56     | 54     |
| 1     | 26     | 26     | 18     | 64     | 65     | 97     | 98     | 95     |
| 2     | 94     | 13     | 74     | 68     | 49     | 78     | 16     | 62     |

A possible allocation that considers the highest valuations each agent has for the items and distributes them accordingly could be:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 4.

An optimal allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0 gets items where they have relatively high value compared to others.
- Agent 1 gets items 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, 3, and 4.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations, ensuring that no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.

Here is a JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
