Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  28  71  86  99  95  34  54
1  10  15  75  41  88   7  23  76
2  19  41  57  13  81   6  80  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total satisfaction or value, subject to the constraint that each agent gets a fair share. Here, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy as much as possible. While ensuring envy-freeness is complex, especially with integer allocations, we can attempt an allocation that is approximately envy-free.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(87 + 28 + 71 + 86 + 99 + 95 + 34 + 54 = 554\)
- Agent 1: \(10 + 15 + 75 + 41 + 88 + 7 + 23 + 76 = 335\)
- Agent 2: \(19 + 41 + 57 + 13 + 81 + 6 + 80 + 63 = 360\)

Given that there are 8 items, a fair share for each agent would be the total value divided by 3. However, since we cannot divide items, we will allocate them based on maximizing individual satisfaction while trying to balance the total value.

Let's consider the items where agents have the highest valuations:

1. Item 4 (highest for Agent 0, second highest for Agent 1).
2. Item 5 (highest for Agent 0).
3. Item 7 (highest for Agent 1).
4. Item 2 (highest for Agent 1).
5. Item 6 (highest for Agent 2).
6. Item 0 (second highest for Agent 0, third highest for Agent 2).
7. Item 3 (second highest for Agent 0, third highest for Agent 1).
8. Item 1 (lowest for Agent 0, second highest for Agent 2).

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences and try to balance the total value:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4 
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5, 6

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: \(87 + 86 + 99 = 272\)
- Agent 1: \(75 + 76 = 151\)
- Agent 2: \(41 + 6 + 80 = 127\)

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
