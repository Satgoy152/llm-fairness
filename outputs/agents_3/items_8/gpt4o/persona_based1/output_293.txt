Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  96  78  34   4  38  11  38
1  37  68  13  34  14  54  36  39
2  11  73  99   1  82  82  31   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 73 99  1 82 82 31  8]]
Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a division where no agent envies another, given their valuations. The goal is to find an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Approach:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly but slightly less than agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - We will start by assigning each agent the item they value the most and then try to balance the remaining items.

3. **Steps for Allocation**:
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0 since it is the highest valued item for them.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for them.
   - Assign remaining items to minimize envy.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items: 1, 3
  - Total Value: 96 (1) + 34 (3)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items: 0, 5, 7
  - Total Value: 37 (0) + 54 (5) + 39 (7)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items: 2, 4, 6
  - Total Value: 99 (2) + 82 (4) + 31 (6)

This allocation attempts to distribute the total values fairly across agents while ensuring each agent has a mix of valuable items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
