Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  30  59  28  80  42  64  22
1   9  91  82  26  13  41  45  46
2  69  59  41  89  21  55  35   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives a reasonable share of value based on their preferences. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 60 + 30 + 59 + 28 + 80 + 42 + 64 + 22 = 385
   - Agent 1: 9 + 91 + 82 + 26 + 13 + 41 + 45 + 46 = 353
   - Agent 2: 69 + 59 + 41 + 89 + 21 + 55 + 35 + 7 = 376

2. **Calculate Average Valuation per Item for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 385 / 8 = 48.125
   - Agent 1: 353 / 8 = 44.125
   - Agent 2: 376 / 8 = 47

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Allocate items that maximize their valuation while considering fairness.
   - Agent 1: Allocate items that maximize their valuation while considering fairness.
   - Agent 2: Allocate items that maximize their valuation while considering fairness.

4. **Iteratively Adjust Allocations to Reduce Envy:**
   - Swap items between agents if it improves fairness without significantly increasing envy.

Here is one possible fair allocation that attempts to balance the agents' valuations with minimal envy:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2, 4] - Total Value: 60 + 59 + 80 = 199
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 5, 7] - Total Value: 91 + 41 + 46 = 178
- Agent 2 receives items [3, 6] - Total Value: 89 + 35 = 124

This allocation tries to balance the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.
