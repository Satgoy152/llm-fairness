Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  50   4  99  45  64  24  14
1  50  65   9  63  99   7  92  72
2   3  40  19  90  27  69  25  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will attempt to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is typically challenging to achieve perfectly with indivisible goods, but we will aim to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for each item:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 0 (71), Item 5 (64)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 4 (99), Item 6 (92), Item 1 (65)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 3 (90), Item 5 (69), Item 7 (41)

Considering these preferences, let's try to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize giving items 3 and 0, which they value highly. We could also consider item 1 as they value it more than agents 2.

2. **Agent 1**: Should receive item 4 and item 6 as they have the highest valuation for these items. Item 7 can be considered since it's also highly valued relative to other agents' valuations.

3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 is highly valued by agent 2. Given the competition for item 3, we may need to drop this to agent 2 to equalize their allocation. Item 2 can be allocated to agent 2 as well since they value it more compared to the other agents.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3 and 0
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6, and 7
- Agent 2: Items 5, 1, and 2

This allocation aims to distribute items based on the highest individual valuations while balancing the total valued received by each agent.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [5, 1, 2]
}
```
