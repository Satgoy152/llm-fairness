Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5   8  25  70  90  46  75  43
1  56  90  43  69  39  96  24  70
2  44  19  35  92  60  24  36  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 5      | 8      | 25     | 70     | 90     | 46     | 75     | 43     |
| 1     | 56     | 90     | 43     | 69     | 39     | 96     | 24     | 70     |
| 2     | 44     | 19     | 35     | 92     | 60     | 24     | 36     | 96     |

Let's use a heuristic approach to allocate the items, trying to maximize each agent's total value while balancing the number of items they receive. We'll allocate items by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring the total number of items per agent is balanced.

1. **Agent 0**: Strong preference for items 4, 3, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Strong preference for items 1, 5, and 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Strong preference for items 7, 3, and 4.

Based on these preferences, we can make the following allocation:

- Allocate items 4, 3, and 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 1, 5, and 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 7 and 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation aims to fairly distribute items based on the highest valuations while maintaining an even distribution of the number of items per agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 0],
    "2": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among their highest-valued, achieving a degree of envy-freeness given the constraints.
