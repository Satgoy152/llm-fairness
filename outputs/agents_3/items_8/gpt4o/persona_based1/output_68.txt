Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  28  19  62  74   5  37  95
1  67  33  96  52  49  91  28  85
2  11  85  65  75   8  47  51  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the given valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given the nature of the problem, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, but we can strive to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations and preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to reach a fair allocation:

1. **List each agent's valuations**:
   - Agent 0: [48, 28, 19, 62, 74, 5, 37, 95]
   - Agent 1: [67, 33, 96, 52, 49, 91, 28, 85]
   - Agent 2: [11, 85, 65, 75, 8, 47, 51, 87]

2. **Initial observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 7 (95), item 4 (74), and item 3 (62).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (96), item 5 (91), and item 0 (67).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1 (85), item 7 (87), and item 3 (75).

3. **Allocate items based on highest valuations and reduce possible envy**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value for them.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 since it is the highest valued item for them and second highest for Agent 2.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as it is their highest valued item.
   - Next, allocate item 5 to Agent 1, who values it highly.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, considering their next highest preference.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, who values it highly.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest preference.
   - Finally, assign item 6 to Agent 0, which is their next best option.

4. **Resulting allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [4, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: [0, 2, 5]
   - Agent 2: [1, 3]

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items according to each agent's preferences, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
