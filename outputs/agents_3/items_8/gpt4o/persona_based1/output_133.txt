Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  67  91  81  84  73  67  71
1  73  84  81  46  83  22  69  77
2   5  13  73  76  86  65  98  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents such that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. One way to approach this problem is by ensuring that the allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items, while also striving for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values highest: item 2 (91), item 4 (84), item 3 (81)
- Agent 1 values highest: item 1 (84), item 0 (73), item 2 (81)
- Agent 2 values highest: item 6 (98), item 4 (86), item 3 (76)

We'll attempt to distribute items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's consider potential allocations:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest preferences:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 2, 3 (highest values).
   - Agent 1: Allocate items 0, 1 (second highest values).
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 6, 4 (highest values).

Now we have allocated 6 items, and the remaining items are 5 and 7.

2. Distribute the remaining items:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (Agent 0 values it at 73).
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 7 (Agent 1 values it at 77).

Now, let's verify:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 5 → Values: 91, 81, 73
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 7 → Values: 73, 84, 77
- Agent 2: Items 6, 4 → Values: 98, 86

This allocation ensures each agent receives items with values they prefer, and attempts to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [6, 4]
}
```
