Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  29   1  59  64  67  62  51
1  56  55  26  48  20   7  90   5
2  65  67  30  67  68  99  30  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other allocation they can see, according to their own valuation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we aim for a balanced distribution that maximizes each agent's total valuation.

Let's allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items, while also trying to balance the number of items allocated to each agent.

First, we identify the items that are highly valued by specific agents:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (66), 5 (67), and 4 (64).
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (90).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (99) and item 1 (67).

We must distribute the items while considering these high valuations and ensuring each agent gets approximately the same number of items.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: [0, 4, 7]
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 66 + 64 + 51 = 181

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: [3, 6]
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 48 + 90 = 138

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: [1, 2, 5]
   - Total valuation for Agent 2: 67 + 30 + 99 = 196

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and also considers the highest value items for each agent. It may not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of the problem, but it aims to be as fair as possible under the constraints.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
