Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  41  26   0  37  16  65  33
1   0  61   3   2  54  62  19  12
2  30  72  98  84  35  49  30  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Given the valuations provided, we must allocate all 8 items among the 3 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by examining some possible allocations:

1. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items to the agent who values them the most.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (40) > Agent 2 (30) > Agent 1 (0)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (72) > Agent 1 (61) > Agent 0 (41)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (98) > Agent 0 (26) > Agent 1 (3)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (84) > Agent 1 (2) > Agent 0 (0)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (37) > Agent 1 (54) > Agent 2 (35)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (62) > Agent 2 (49) > Agent 0 (16)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (65) > Agent 1 (19) > Agent 2 (30)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 (83) > Agent 0 (33) > Agent 1 (12)

This initial greedy allocation would give:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 3, 7]

However, this allocation results in some imbalance, particularly with Agent 1 receiving only one item. Let's adjust to ensure a more balanced distribution while still considering valuations:

- **Adjusted Allocation**: Reallocate some items to balance the number of items each agent receives.
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0 to increase Agent 1's total valuation.
  - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 to improve their total valuation while reducing Agent 0's number of items.
  - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items between the agents.

The adjusted allocation thus becomes:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5, Agent 1 receives item 4, and Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy by considering agents' valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
