Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  50  18  62  42   9   4   3
1  10  86  61  18  35  58  58  44
2  51  70  98  94  15  25  84  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 70 98 94 15 25 84 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent feels that another agent has a better allocation based on their own valuation. Given the valuations provided, we can use a simple approach to allocate items one by one by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The values are [97, 10, 51]. Agent 0 values it the most, so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The values are [50, 86, 70]. Agent 1 values it the most, so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The values are [18, 61, 98]. Agent 2 values it the most, so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The values are [62, 18, 94]. Agent 2 values it the most, so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The values are [42, 35, 15]. Agent 0 values it the most, so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The values are [9, 58, 25]. Agent 1 values it the most, so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The values are [4, 58, 84]. Agent 2 values it the most, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: The values are [3, 44, 22]. Agent 1 values it the most, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, which should help in achieving envy-freeness, as each agent receives items they highly value.
