Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  28  12  66  95  23  75  17
1  88  74  88  51  88  63  37  58
2  18  40  56   4  60  44   5  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

We'll start by analyzing the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (83), 4 (95), 6 (75) the most.
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (88), 2 (88), 4 (88) the most.
- Agent 2 values items: 2 (56), 4 (60), 7 (54) the most.

Given these preferences, we need to allocate the items such that the total allocation is fair and considers each agent's highest-valued items.

One simple approach is to start by giving each agent one of their highest-valued items, and then distribute the remaining items trying to maintain balance in terms of total value received by each agent.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign Agent 0 their highest-valued item, item 4.
2. Assign Agent 1 their highest-valued item, item 0.
3. Assign Agent 2 their highest-valued item, item 2.

Now, we have allocated three items. Let's distribute the remaining items to maintain fairness:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has a reasonably high value for them.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2, which is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, which is decently valued by them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it balances their total valuation.

This leads us to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value and preferences among the agents, minimizing potential envy.
