Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  94  55  99  82  92  30  22
1  98  94   0  65  72  30   4  46
2   7  98  76  30  70  98  43   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 94 55 99 82 92 30 22]
 [98 94  0 65 72 30  4 46]
 [ 7 98 76 30 70 98 43  2]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible given integer constraints), we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the others. This can be challenging with integer constraints, but we will aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy.

First, let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 91 + 94 + 55 + 99 + 82 + 92 + 30 + 22 = 565
- Agent 1's total value: 98 + 94 + 0 + 65 + 72 + 30 + 4 + 46 = 409
- Agent 2's total value: 7 + 98 + 76 + 30 + 70 + 98 + 43 + 2 = 424

Next, we'll try to allocate items to balance these valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Based on individual item values, we can check how items might be distributed:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 3 (99), 5 (92), and 1 (94).
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 (98), 1 (94), and 4 (72).
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 (98), 5 (98), and 2 (76).

Using these preferences, let's propose an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3] with values 94 and 99 respectively. Total valuation = 193.
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 4, 7] with values 98, 72, and 46 respectively. Total valuation = 216.
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5, 6] with values 76, 98, and 43 respectively. Total valuation = 217.

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent has a reasonable total valuation, minimizing envy as much as possible with integer allocations.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
