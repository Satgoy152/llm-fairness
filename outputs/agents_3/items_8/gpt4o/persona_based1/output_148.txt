Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  70  41  76   1  50  47  85
1   1  88  84  87  20  91  45  28
2  79  47   4  67  10  85  75  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, the challenge is to distribute the 8 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's first analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values items: 
  - High: 3 (76), 7 (85)
  - Medium: 1 (70), 5 (50), 6 (47)
  - Low: 0 (36), 2 (41), 4 (1)

- **Agent 1** values items:
  - High: 1 (88), 3 (87), 5 (91)
  - Medium: 2 (84), 6 (45)
  - Low: 0 (1), 4 (20), 7 (28)

- **Agent 2** values items:
  - High: 0 (79), 5 (85), 6 (75), 7 (71)
  - Medium: 3 (67), 1 (47)
  - Low: 2 (4), 4 (10)

To make an envy-free allocation, we consider each agent's preferences and try to allocate items such that their perceived value is maximized according to their own valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Priority: Items 3, 7
   - Allocation: [3, 7] (Total value: 76 + 85 = 161)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Priority: Items 1, 5
   - Allocation: [1, 5] (Total value: 88 + 91 = 179)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Priority: Items 0, 6
   - Remaining: Items 2, 4 (lower value items)
   - Allocation: [0, 2, 4, 6] (Total value: 79 + 4 + 10 + 75 = 168)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, and the total perceived value should be satisfactory as each agent receives high-priority items according to their preferences.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
