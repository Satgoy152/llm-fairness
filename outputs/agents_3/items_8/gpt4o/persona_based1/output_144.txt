Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  90  59  17  25  65  54  59
1  60  91  39   2  45  65  57  72
2  30  10   2  30  92  47  53  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 91 39  2 45 65 57 72]
 [30 10  2 30 92 47 53 36]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we must consider the agents' valuations to minimize envy and maximize fairness. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free Allocation method, balancing the agents' preferences as much as possible. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** values items 1, 5, 6, and 7 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 significantly more than the others.

Based on these observations, we can allocate as follows to try to balance the valuations and minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4, 6

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while distributing the total value as evenly as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of the total value while trying to maintain envy-freeness.
