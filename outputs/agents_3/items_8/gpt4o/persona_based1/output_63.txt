Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  85  54  37  57   8  33  22
1  50  81  92  97  45  70  87  11
2  49  54  39  13  42   8  19  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 81 92 97 45 70 87 11]
 [49 54 39 13 42  8 19 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness to the extent possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what others receive, based on their preferences.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [40, 85, 54, 37, 57, 8, 33, 22]
Agent 1: [50, 81, 92, 97, 45, 70, 87, 11]
Agent 2: [49, 54, 39, 13, 42, 8, 19, 61]
```

We can use a method that tries to maximize the total value assigned to each agent, while ensuring a fair distribution of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where items are allocated iteratively to the agent who values them the most but hasn't yet received a better item.

Allocation process:

1. **Item 3**: Highest value is 97 (Agent 1), so Agent 1 gets it.
2. **Item 2**: Highest value is 92 (Agent 1), but Agent 1 already has an item, so consider others. Agent 1 gets it as it's still the highest.
3. **Item 1**: Highest value is 85 (Agent 0), so Agent 0 gets it.
4. **Item 6**: Highest value is 87 (Agent 1), so Agent 1 gets it.
5. **Item 7**: Highest value is 61 (Agent 2), so Agent 2 gets it.
6. **Item 0**: Highest value is 50 (Agent 1), but Agent 1 already has 3 items. Next highest is 49 (Agent 2), so Agent 2 gets it.
7. **Item 4**: Highest value is 57 (Agent 0), so Agent 0 gets it.
8. **Item 5**: Highest value is 70 (Agent 1), but Agent 1 already has 3 items. Next highest is 8 (Agent 0 and Agent 2), but Agent 0 has a slightly higher total value sum, so Agent 0 gets it.

Based on this process, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints, with each agent receiving items they place relatively high value on, and without exceeding the total number of items.
