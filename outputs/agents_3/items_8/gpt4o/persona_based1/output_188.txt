Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  51  69  19  78   0  95  41
1  28  15  81  59  60  65  99  26
2  14  50   4  19  61  80   4   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuation: Prioritize items with higher valuations for agent 0.
   - Optimal items: 6 (value: 95), 4 (value: 78)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuation: Prioritize items with higher valuations for agent 1.
   - Optimal items: 2 (value: 81), 6 (value: 99), 5 (value: 65)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuation: Prioritize items with higher valuations for agent 2.
   - Optimal items: 5 (value: 80), 4 (value: 61)

However, we need to ensure that the allocation includes all 8 items and that each agent receives a fair share while minimizing envy. Here's a possible allocation that satisfies these conditions:

- Allocate items that are most valued by each agent and aim for a balance where the total valuation for each agent is roughly equal.

Let's distribute the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 6]
  - Total valuation: 1 (item 0) + 51 (item 1) + 95 (item 6) = 147
- **Agent 1**: [2, 5, 7]
  - Total valuation: 81 (item 2) + 65 (item 5) + 26 (item 7) = 172
- **Agent 2**: [3, 4]
  - Total valuation: 19 (item 3) + 61 (item 4) = 80

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, which may help in minimizing envy among the agents.
