Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  33  64  71   8  74  63  16
1  95  94  65  55  97  13  78  49
2  42  70  54  67   3  67  47  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a manner that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share of the items compared to others based on their valuations.

Let's first summarize the total valuations of each agent to see how they value all the items collectively:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 54 + 33 + 64 + 71 + 8 + 74 + 63 + 16 = 383
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 + 94 + 65 + 55 + 97 + 13 + 78 + 49 = 546
- Agent 2's total valuation: 42 + 70 + 54 + 67 + 3 + 67 + 47 + 54 = 404

Now, let's consider a fair allocation approach. We will attempt to distribute the items in a way that balances the valuation perceived by each agent.

### Allocation Strategy
1. We will try to match the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items to their proportional share of total available valuation.
2. We prioritize items based on the highest individual valuations by agents to reduce envy.

### Allocation Process
- Start by assigning high-value items to the agents who value them the most.
- Ensure that each agent ends up with a proportionate total value based on their overall valuation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest overall valuation, so we allocate high-value items they particularly favor:
   - Item 4 (value 97), Item 0 (value 95), and Item 1 (value 94).

2. **Agent 0** should receive items where their valuation is relatively high:
   - Item 5 (value 74), and Item 3 (value 71).

3. **Agent 2** should receive items that are left but ensure they have significant value:
   - Item 7 (value 54), and Item 2 (value 54).

### Final Allocations
Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation, reducing envy as much as possible given the constraints of the problem.
