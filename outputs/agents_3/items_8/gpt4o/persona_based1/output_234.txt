Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  33  16  37  50  31  68  38
1  56  65  80  75  30  73  40  38
2  98   1   4  51  97  87  98  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints that each agent should get an integer number of items and all 8 items must be allocated, here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 6 the most.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values items 2, 3, and 5 the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 4 and 7 the most.

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 4, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and in this scenario, it aims at reducing envy by considering the highest value items each agent prefers.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```
