Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  26  28  33   6  85  19  16
1   5  97  15  31  74  74  58  52
2  32  68  85  59   6  33  18   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction while considering envy-freeness and other fairness criteria. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent has different valuations for each item, and we need to assign all 8 items.
   - We aim to minimize envy and ensure fairness.

2. **Approach:**
   - Assign some high-value items to each agent based on their valuations.
   - Make sure each agent's total valuation is balanced to minimize envy.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so assign item 1 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
   - Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation using the above strategy:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign items 5 and 3. Total valuation: 85 (item 5) + 33 (item 3) = 118

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign items 1, 4, and 7. Total valuation: 97 (item 1) + 74 (item 4) + 52 (item 7) = 223

- **Agent 2:**
  - Assign items 2, 0, and 6. Total valuation: 85 (item 2) + 32 (item 0) + 18 (item 6) = 135

This allocation ensures that the items are fairly distributed based on the agents' preferences, with an aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 0, 6]
}
```
