Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  73  83  60  17  94  55  31
1  64  33  18  66  44   0  26   7
2  76  91  32   1  40  71  73  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation ensuring envy-freeness and an equitable distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, we need to consider several factors. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step strategy for this allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent to understand their overall valuation preferences.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Use a method such as "round robin" or "sequential allocation" based on sorted preferences to ensure that each agent's most valued items are considered.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: After an initial allocation, check for envy among agents. Adjust allocations if necessary to reduce or eliminate envy.

4. **Ensure Completeness**: Make sure all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations.

Using these steps, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for items 5, 2, and 1.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 3, and 4 higher than others.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 0, but after removing these from consideration, values item 6 and 7.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 3, 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 6, 7

This allocation aligns with each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy, given their relative valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their valuation given the constraints.
