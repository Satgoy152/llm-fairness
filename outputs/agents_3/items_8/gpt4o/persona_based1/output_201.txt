Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  35  50  46  76  69  59  64
1  97  46  35  27  23  34  72  47
2  41  39  58  68  70   0  33  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, considering each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0's highest valued items are 4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1, 0.
- Agent 1's highest valued items are 0, 6, 1, 7, 2, 5, 3, 4.
- Agent 2's highest valued items are 7, 4, 3, 2, 0, 1, 6, 5.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly and avoiding item overlaps where possible.
2. Try to balance the total value each agent receives to prevent significant envy.

Let's proceed with an allocation based on these principles:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 as it is their highest-valued item.

We now have to allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it is their fourth-highest valued item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their third-highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their fourth-highest valued item.

The remaining items are 3 and 5.

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is their third-highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their third-highest valued item.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent and aligns with their preferences as much as possible.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [7, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
