Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  37  56  68  21  15  68  55
1  15  76  65  56  55   3  81  33
2  12   8  15   4  63   2  34  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives while ensuring each agent prefers their allocation over the others', if possible. Given the valuations, one viable method is to manually inspect potential allocations to balance each agent's satisfaction.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 3
  - Total Value: 68 + 68 = 136

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 1, 2, 6
  - Total Value: 76 + 65 + 81 = 222

- Agent 2:
  - Items: 4, 5, 7
  - Total Value: 63 + 2 + 93 = 158

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent gets a reasonable total value according to their preferences and no agent envies another significantly. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation accounts for all 8 items and ensures that each agent receives at least some items while aiming to keep the distribution as fair as possible given the provided valuations.
