Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  57  33  54  41  42  62  21
1  80  26  99  44  22  99  73  11
2  58   6  67  85  83  76  63  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent values their own allocation as much as or more than the allocations given to any other agent. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially when dealing with integer allocations, we can try to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's use the following heuristic approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: \( 76 + 57 + 33 + 54 + 41 + 42 + 62 + 21 = 386 \)
- Agent 1: \( 80 + 26 + 99 + 44 + 22 + 99 + 73 + 11 = 454 \)
- Agent 2: \( 58 + 6 + 67 + 85 + 83 + 76 + 63 + 53 = 491 \)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (57).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (83).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (73).
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (53).

This initial allocation can lead to some imbalance, so let's adjust to ensure each agent gets some items:

- Agent 0: Initially gets item 1.
- Agent 1: Initially gets items 0, 2, 5, 6.
- Agent 2: Initially gets items 3, 4, 7.

To achieve a more balanced allocation, we can adjust based on the next highest valuations for some items:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as they value it second-highest after Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 7

Here's the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of value and items among the agents as fairly as possible given the constraints.
