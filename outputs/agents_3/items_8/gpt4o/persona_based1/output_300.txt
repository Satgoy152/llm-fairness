Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  69  40   1  28  63  87   2
1  99  72  20  41  19  46  32  57
2  11  93  95  37  65  18  55  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to any other agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived value for each agent:

### Valuations Table
```
Agent | 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
--------------------------------------
0     | 95  69  40   1  28  63  87   2
1     | 99  72  20  41  19  46  32  57
2     | 11  93  95  37  65  18  55  64
```

### Strategy
To distribute the items fairly, we aim to maximize the sum of values each agent gets from their allocated items. A possible approach is to use a combination of methods, such as maximizing the Nash welfare or minimizing envy iteratively by considering each agent's preferences.

### Allocation
Based on the valuations, here's a possible fair division of the items:

- **Agent 0**: Let's try to give Agent 0 items with the highest valuations according to their preferences, considering constraints from other agents.
- **Agent 1**: Similarly, allocate items to Agent 1 based on their preferences.
- **Agent 2**: Finally, assign items to Agent 2, ensuring all items are distributed.

By following this strategy, hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 as well but slightly less than Agent 0.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 2 and 1.

Considering these factors, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of high-value items among agents, taking into account their respective valuations and attempting to minimize envy.
