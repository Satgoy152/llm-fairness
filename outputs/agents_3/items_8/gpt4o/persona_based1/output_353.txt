Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  79  39  27  63  37  37  32
1  22  17  56  88  43  99  86  12
2  13  39  22  63   2  90  53  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 17 56 88 43 99 86 12]
 [13 39 22 63  2 90 53 93]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division with the goal of minimizing envy among agents, we should take into account each agent's valuation for the items. This problem is complex and finding an absolutely envy-free allocation may not be feasible, but we can aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the circumstances.

Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (79), and item 4 next (63). To maximize Agent 0's happiness, we could allocate these items to them.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation of item 5 (99), and item 3 (88) next, so these should be allocated to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most (93), and item 5 is also highly valued by Agent 2, but since Agent 1 values item 5 even more, we'll allocate item 7 to Agent 2. For Agent 2, we can pick items with their next highest valuation.
4. Continue this process trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 6, 7]

This maximizes each agent's satisfaction as much as possible given the constraints and attempts to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Here is the allocation formatted as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
