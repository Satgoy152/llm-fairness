Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  27  94  80  43  83  47  34
1  95  11  14  64  59  61  44  72
2   7  26   6  96  99  62  96  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving strict envy-freeness for all agents might not be possible in every scenario, especially with such a small set of items and varying valuations. 

Let's attempt to distribute the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest valuations are for items 2, 5, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**'s highest valuations are for items 0, 7, and 5.
3. **Agent 2**'s highest valuations are for items 4, 3, and 6.

Considering the above preferences, we can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent and then resolve any conflicts:

- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0** because it's the highest valued item for Agent 0 and not highly valued by others.
- **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1** as it's one of the highest valued items for Agent 1.
- **Allocate item 6 to Agent 2** since it's highly valued by Agent 2 and not by others.
- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2** since it is the highest valued item for Agent 2 and not as high for others.

Now we deal with the remaining items: 0, 1, 4, and 7. 

- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 1** because it's the highest valued item for Agent 1.
- **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2** as it's highly valued by Agent 2.
- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0** as it's not highly valued by any other agent.
- **Allocate item 7 to Agent 1** since Agent 1 values it highly.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 0, 7],
    "2": [6, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible given the constraints, and all items are distributed.
