Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  35  98  34  93  49  71  63
1  92  54  85  12  80  61   5  33
2   2  48   6  50  75  36  82   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and attempting to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (98) and 4 (93).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (92) and also values item 2 highly (85).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (82) and item 4 relatively high (75).

2. **Strategy for Allocation**:
   - Prioritize assigning high-value items to agents that value them the most.
   - Ensure each agent receives some items to maintain fairness.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as this is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2, their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1, their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest and they value it more than Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, since 35 is higher for Agent 0 than for the others.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than the others.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2.

After making these allocations, each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are distributed.

Final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [6, 3]
}
```
