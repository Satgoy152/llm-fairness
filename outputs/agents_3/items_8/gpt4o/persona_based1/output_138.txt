Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96   2  50  76   4  45  68  10
1  30  16  92  64  53  27  53  53
2  63  19  47  80  82  65  38  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 16 92 64 53 27 53 53]
 [63 19 47 80 82 65 38 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, ideally minimizing envy. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 and item 3. Allocating these high-value items can maximize fairness for Agent 0. 
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 highly, so it should be allocated to them. Additionally, item 4 is of relatively high value for them.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 and item 3 highly, but since item 3 is already allocated, we consider their next highest items, which are item 5 and item 6.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 3] 
- **Agent 1**: [2, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 5, 6, 7]

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of their preferred items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
