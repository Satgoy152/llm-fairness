Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  85  87  40  72  49  65  76
1  63  84  37   1  29  64  80  11
2  75  49  25  24  45  85  54   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 84 37  1 29 64 80 11]
 [75 49 25 24 45 85 54  9]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent is satisfied with their share according to their valuations. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free up to One Good (EF1) criterion, which ensures that no agent envies another agent after potentially removing one item from the envied agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [8, 85, 87, 40, 72, 49, 65, 76]
- **Agent 1**: [63, 84, 37, 1, 29, 64, 80, 11]
- **Agent 2**: [75, 49, 25, 24, 45, 85, 54, 9]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0. The highest valued items for Agent 0 are 2 (87) and 1 (85). Assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued items for Agent 1 are 6 (80), 0 (63), and 5 (64). Assign these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued items for Agent 2 are 5 (85), 0 (75), and 6 (54). Since items 5 and 6 have already been assigned, assign Agent 2 the next highest valued items, which are 4 (45) and 3 (24).

Re-evaluate the allocation to ensure that all 8 items are distributed and each agent's allocation matches their valuation preferences as closely as possible.

### Final Allocation:
- Assign item 7 (76) to Agent 0 as it has a high value for them.
- Assign item 3 (1) to Agent 1 as it is the least valuable remaining item and does not significantly affect envy.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 6.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and distribute items fairly among the agents based on their valuations. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
