Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6   2  17  86  86  67  45  10
1  77  19  55  65  22  37  19  22
2  32  20  35  45  95  15  62  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can apply a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or simply try to distribute items in such a way that each agent feels satisfied with their share relative to their valuations.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Calculate total values**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items, which helps to understand how much value they perceive in total.

2. **Allocate items to maximize minimum satisfaction**: Start by assigning items to agents according to their highest valuation per item and try to balance the overall value that each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values items highly at 86, 86 (items 3 and 4), and 67 (item 5). Assign items 3 and 4 to agent 0 to maximize their high-value allocation.
  
- **Agent 1**: Valuations are relatively more spread out. Assign item 0 (77) to agent 1 as it is their highest valuation. After that, assign item 2 (55), and item 5 (37) to balance out the value.

- **Agent 2**: Has a strong preference for item 4 (95), but since it is already allocated to agent 0, assign item 6 (62) and item 7 (80), which are their next highest preferences.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a substantial portion of the total value they perceive, thus minimizing envy.

Final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
