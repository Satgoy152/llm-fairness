Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  30  66  13  85  16  36  25
1   9  31   2  33  21  54  42  37
2  77  25  42  27  62  32  89  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [77 25 42 27 62 32 89 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuation. We aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [86, 30, 66, 13, 85, 16, 36, 25]
- Agent 1: [9, 31, 2, 33, 21, 54, 42, 37]
- Agent 2: [77, 25, 42, 27, 62, 32, 89, 99]

One possible approach is to allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent without causing envy. Let's proceed with this process:

1. **Allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 86, which is the highest among the agents.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 99, which is the highest among the agents.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 89, which is the highest among the agents.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85, which is the highest among the agents.

2. **Continue allocating based on remaining high values:**
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, the highest remaining valuation.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 54, which is the highest among the agents.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 33, which is the highest among the agents.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 31, which is the highest remaining valuation.

Now, let's compile these allocations into the required JSON format. Each agent should receive the items that maximize their utility while minimizing envy:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, all 8 items are assigned, and each agent receives items that they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.
