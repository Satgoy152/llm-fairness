Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  55  69  36  10  66  78  70
1  83  39  99  63  65  31  51  98
2  39  72   2  31  80   4  87  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Given their valuation, we can allocate items that provide them with a reasonable total value without causing envy.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - This agent has high valuations for multiple items, so we'll allocate items to maximize their perceived value.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Similarly, we'll allocate items to this agent considering their highest valuations.

Let's look at the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Items 5 and 7
  - Total value: 66 (item 5) + 70 (item 7) = 136

- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 2, and 4
  - Total value: 83 (item 0) + 99 (item 2) + 65 (item 4) = 247

- **Agent 2:** Items 1, 3, and 6
  - Total value: 72 (item 1) + 31 (item 3) + 87 (item 6) = 190

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations, reducing the likelihood of envy. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
