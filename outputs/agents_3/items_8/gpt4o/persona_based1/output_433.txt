Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  62  92   0  23  77  49  18
1  36  24  46  42  20  50  31  17
2  87  23  11   5  97  80  40  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating items among agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy (envy-freeness) and considers the valuations each agent has for the items. Let's go through the process and provide a solution.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [60, 62, 92, 0, 23, 77, 49, 18]
   - Agent 1: [36, 24, 46, 42, 20, 50, 31, 17]
   - Agent 2: [87, 23, 11, 5, 97, 80, 40, 45]

2. **Assessing Preferences:**

   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4.

3. **Initial Assignment:**

   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

   After the initial allocation, we need to allocate the remaining items [0, 1, 3, 6, 7] while considering overall valuations:

   - **Item 0:** Highest value is for Agent 2 (87).
     - Assign to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (62).
     - Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3:** Highest value is for Agent 1 (42).
     - Assign to Agent 1.
   - **Item 6:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (49).
     - Assign to Agent 0.
   - **Item 7:** Highest value is for Agent 2 (45).
     - Assign to Agent 2.

5. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: [1, 2, 6]
   - Agent 1: [3, 5]
   - Agent 2: [0, 4, 7]

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each item, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
