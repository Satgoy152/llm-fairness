Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  67  86   5  33  29  12   2
1  67  62  57  41  19  47  12  22
2  39  59  38  42  77  24  42  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 67 86  5 33 29 12  2]
 [67 62 57 41 19 47 12 22]
 [39 59 38 42 77 24 42 48]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations. Given the valuations table, we need to find a way to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [94, 67, 86, 5, 33, 29, 12, 2]
- Agent 1: [67, 62, 57, 41, 19, 47, 12, 22]
- Agent 2: [39, 59, 38, 42, 77, 24, 42, 48]

First, we'll try to allocate the items to maximize each agentâ€™s total valuation while ensuring that the division is as fair as possible.

One potential solution is:

1. Agent 0 gets items with the highest valuations for them: 0, 1, 2.
2. Agent 1 gets items where they have relatively high valuations compared to others: 3, 5.
3. Agent 2 gets items that maximize their valuation: 4, 6, 7.

This allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6, 7]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

With this allocation, each agent has items that maximize their valuation given the constraints of integer division, and each agent receives at least one item, ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.
