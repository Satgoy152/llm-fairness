Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  97  94  70  90  50  65   0
1  59   1  74  54  17  54  28  79
2  34  51  39  39  62  95   5  21
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we aim to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which means that any envy an agent feels towards another's allocation can be eliminated by removing a single item from the other agent's bundle.

The given valuations matrix is:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 40 | 97 | 94 | 70 | 90 | 50 | 65 | 0  |
| 1          | 59 | 1  | 74 | 54 | 17 | 54 | 28 | 79 |
| 2          | 34 | 51 | 39 | 39 | 62 | 95 | 5  | 21 |

Let's allocate the items as follows to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent and consider the items that provide the highest value to each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents aiming to balance total valuation while ensuring no agent can benefit significantly from another's allocation by removing one item.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 and 2, and has reasonable values for items 3, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 has a unique high value for item 7, with moderate values for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5, with moderate values for items 1 and 4.

Allocation strategy:
- Assign item 1 and 2 to Agent 0, as these are highly valued by Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as this is uniquely valued by them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as this is their highest value item.
- Distribute remaining items to maintain balance and minimal envy.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5, 6

This allocation is structured to be fair under the EF1 criterion.

The JSON format for these allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
