Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  53  56  51  45  43  83  15
1  81  93  21  25   5   9   9  71
2  37  97  44  78  89  89  25  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a division that maximizes fairness. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. However, in many cases, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, so we strive for approximate fairness.

Here are the steps I followed to determine an allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 6.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest, followed by item 0 and item 7.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 and values items 3, 4, and 5 quite highly.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items based on each agent's highest valuations while ensuring no agent feels envy towards another's allocation.
   - Ensure each agent receives an approximately equal share of total value based on their valuations.

3. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Start by assigning items with the highest valuations to each agent.
   - Adjust allocations by swapping items to balance the overall value each agent receives.

Following this strategy, here is a fair allocation of items:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 2, 6]
  - These items provide a good utility balance for Agent 0 based on their high valuations for these items.

- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 7]
  - Although Agent 1 values item 1 the most, they also have a high valuation for item 7, which helps balance their utility.

- **Agent 2:** Items [3, 4, 5]
  - These items provide high utility to Agent 2, who values them relatively more compared to other agents.

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives according to their preferences while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.
