Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  39  73  68  63  64  49  50
1  71  20  31  97  23   1  84  53
2  40   7  67  11  22  83  20  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent considers their allocation as fair given their valuations. Here, I'll aim to distribute the items so each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (73), Item 3 (68), Item 5 (64)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 0 (71), Item 6 (84)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (83), Item 2 (67), Item 0 (40)

By examining the preferences, we can make allocations that try to balance the agents' highest valued items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3 (97) is the highest value for Agent 1 and second-highest for Agent 0. Allocating this to Agent 1 will reduce potential envy.
   - Item 6 (84) is also a high value for Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 (73) is the highest value for Agent 0, and we should allocate it to them.
   - Item 5 (64) is also highly valued by Agent 0 and is a top choice for Agent 2. Allocating it to Agent 0 can minimize Agent 0's envy.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 (40) is highly valued by Agent 2 but also by Agent 1. Allocating it to Agent 2 provides a fair share of value.
   - Item 5 (83) was allocated to Agent 0, so we look for the next best options like Item 4 (22) and Item 7 (16).

We aim to balance the allocations to ensure each agent gets a fair value share, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 7]
}
```

Here, each agent has received items based on their preferences, and the allocations are balanced to reduce potential envy. Note that the allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
