Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  37  12  76  52  42  20  23
1  41  19  51  61  10  20  80  41
2  65   8  73  53  81  28  13  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need an allocation where each agent perceives their bundle as at least as valuable as the others. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging, so we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: [28, 37, 12, 76, 52, 42, 20, 23]
- Agent 1 values: [41, 19, 51, 61, 10, 20, 80, 41]
- Agent 2 values: [65, 8, 73, 53, 81, 28, 13, 44]

We aim to distribute these items such that each agent gets a fair share, considering their valuations.

One approach is to use a heuristic method to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's total perceived value, taking turns in a round-robin manner or using a priority system based on highest valuations.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high preference for items 3 (76) and 1 (37).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (80) and item 2 (51).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (81) and item 0 (65).

With this understanding, we can try the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 6, 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 4, 0, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 2, 7],
    "2": [4, 0, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and ensures all items are distributed, aiming for the fairest possible division given the constraints.
