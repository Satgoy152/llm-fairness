Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  68  12  89  29  13  50  28
1  38  20  14  78  37  25  53  71
2   8  51  15  73  40  72  26  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we must aim for a solution that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they perceive the others to have received.

Given the valuations, we can employ a fair division algorithm like the adjusted winner or envy-free procedures, but here we will manually attempt a fair distribution based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 1, and 3. We will allocate items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the highest, followed by item 6. We will allocate items 7 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest, followed by item 4. We will allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 2.

4. The remaining item is 2. Agent 0 values item 2 the least, so to balance out the allocation, we check which remaining agent values it the most. Agent 2 values item 2 more than Agent 1, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2. 

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above reasoning, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's perceived value from their allocated items, while ensuring that all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
