Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  47  20  23  25   0  36  99
1  14  57  91  57  85  14  39  73
2  72  93  56  17  63  48  37   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocation, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to the valuations given.

Given the challenge of achieving envy-freeness, one practical approach is to use the maximum sum of valuations or a similar heuristic to allocate items. We will try to balance the allocations so that no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their individual valuations. In the absence of a perfectly envy-free solution, we aim for a fair division where each agent receives a reasonable value from their perspective.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to achieve fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items with high value for Agent 0: Item 7, Item 0
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items with high value for Agent 1: Item 2, Item 4
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items with high value for Agent 2: Item 1, Item 3, Item 5, Item 6

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [7, 0] (values: 99, 42)
- Agent 1: [2, 4] (values: 91, 85)
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 5, 6] (values: 93, 17, 48, 37)

This allocation keeps the total number of items equal to 8 and attempts to give each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total value received by each agent based on their own valuations, making it a fair division given the constraints.
