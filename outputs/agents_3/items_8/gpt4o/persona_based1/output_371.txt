Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62   2   9  18  78  65  87  34
1  43  89  35   6  44  46  77  53
2   9  99  31  97  45  90   7  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that also aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. One approach to achieve this is to use the concept of maximizing each agent's allocation based on their preferences while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:**
   - Item 6: 87
   - Item 4: 78
   - Item 5: 65
   - Item 0: 62

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:**
   - Item 1: 89
   - Item 6: 77
   - Item 5: 46
   - Item 7: 53

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations:**
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 3: 97
   - Item 5: 90
   - Item 7: 82

Let's try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with highest values for Agent 0.
  - Assign item 6 (value 87 to Agent 0).
  - Assign item 4 (value 78 to Agent 0).

- **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with highest values for Agent 1.
  - Assign item 1 (value 89 to Agent 1).
  - Assign item 7 (value 53 to Agent 1).

- **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with highest values for Agent 2.
  - Assign item 3 (value 97 to Agent 2).
  - Assign item 5 (value 90 to Agent 2).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 62 to Agent 0).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 31 to Agent 2).

The allocation can be represented in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and all 8 items are allocated.
