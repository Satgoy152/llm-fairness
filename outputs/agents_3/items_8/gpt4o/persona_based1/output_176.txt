Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  18  99  86  50  29  84  61
1  24  33  77  93  29  63  38  91
2  87  75  93   9  60  31  21  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 33 77 93 29 63 38 91]
 [87 75 93  9 60 31 21 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we evaluate the valuations matrix and attempt to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives a set of items they value as highly as possible, minimizing envy.

### Valuations Matrix
```
Agent/Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
-----------|--------------------------------
     0     | 66  18  99  86  50  29  84  61
     1     | 24  33  77  93  29  63  38  91
     2     | 87  75  93   9  60  31  21  98
```

### Strategy
1. **Maximize Individual Satisfaction**: Allocate items to agents where they have the highest valuation for those items, and ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
2. **Minimize Envy**: Try to distribute the items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of total valuation each agent gets.

### Allocation Process
- **Agent 0**: Highly values items 2 and 3. Let's allocate item 2 (99) to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 and 7. Let's allocate item 3 (93) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highly values items 0 and 7. Let's allocate item 0 (87) to Agent 2.

Continue with other items in a similar manner while ensuring everyone gets a fair share:

1. Allocate item 7 (98) to Agent 2, as they value it highly.
2. Allocate item 1 (75) to Agent 2, next highest value.
3. Allocate item 4 (60) to Agent 2, next highest value.
4. Allocate item 5 (63) to Agent 1, next highest value.
5. Allocate item 6 (84) to Agent 0, next highest value.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable distribution based on their valuations while attempting to minimize envy.
