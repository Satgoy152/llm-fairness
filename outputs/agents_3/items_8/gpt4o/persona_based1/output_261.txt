Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  10  92  83  53  50  97  94
1  13  70   7   7  72  17  98   7
2  15   4  33  37  60  42  77  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 10 92 83 53 50 97 94]
 [13 70  7  7 72 17 98  7]
 [15  4 33 37 60 42 77 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. This means each agent should receive a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's first examine the total valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 60 + 10 + 92 + 83 + 53 + 50 + 97 + 94 = 539
- Agent 1's total valuation: 13 + 70 + 7 + 7 + 72 + 17 + 98 + 7 = 291
- Agent 2's total valuation: 15 + 4 + 33 + 37 + 60 + 42 + 77 + 63 = 331

Given these valuations, let's attempt to allocate items such that the perceived value of the allocation is balanced for each agent.

1. Assign items with the highest perceived value to each agent.
2. Attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their items.
3. Ensure each agent has at least one item, if possible.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 7]
  - Value: 60 + 83 + 94 = 237

- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 6]
  - Value: 70 + 72 + 98 = 240

- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
  - Value: 33 + 42 = 75

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring a relatively balanced total valuation across agents. The assignment is not perfectly envy-free but tries to minimize envy.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
