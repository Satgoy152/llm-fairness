Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  99  74  15  34   6  82  90
1  90  97  93  81  24  56  75  62
2  74  60  50  78  65  55  54  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 97 93 81 24 56 75 62]
 [74 60 50 78 65 55 54 88]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. A possible way to achieve this is by using the "maximize the minimum gain" approach, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share relative to their own valuations.

Letâ€™s calculate the total valuation for each agent and then attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes the minimum valuation each agent receives.

Agent 0's total valuation: 72 + 99 + 74 + 15 + 34 + 6 + 82 + 90 = 472  
Agent 1's total valuation: 90 + 97 + 93 + 81 + 24 + 56 + 75 + 62 = 578  
Agent 2's total valuation: 74 + 60 + 50 + 78 + 65 + 55 + 54 + 88 = 524  

Now let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest valuation: Item 1 (99)
  - Second highest: Item 7 (90)
  - Third highest: Item 6 (82)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest valuation: Item 0 (90)
  - Second highest: Item 2 (93)
  - Third highest: Item 3 (81)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuation: Item 7 (88)
  - Second highest: Item 3 (78)
  - Third highest: Item 4 (65)

Considering overlap and reallocating for a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5, 6]

Ensuring each agent has a fair allocation and all 8 items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation is adjusted to ensure all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
