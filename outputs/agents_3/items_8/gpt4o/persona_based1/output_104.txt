Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   6  29  72  70  48  60  36
1  17  82  93  82  84  38  25  73
2  71   7  16  90  53  39  34  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

   - Agent 0: 99 + 6 + 29 + 72 + 70 + 48 + 60 + 36 = 420
   - Agent 1: 17 + 82 + 93 + 82 + 84 + 38 + 25 + 73 = 494
   - Agent 2: 71 + 7 + 16 + 90 + 53 + 39 + 34 + 80 = 390

2. Aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy:

   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 99 for Agent 0, highest for any item)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 93 for Agent 1, highest for any item)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 90 for Agent 2, highest for any item)

3. Continue allocating the remaining items to balance their values:

   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (value 80)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 84)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 48)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 60)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 82)

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair distribution of the items based on their individual valuations, aiming to minimize envy among them.
