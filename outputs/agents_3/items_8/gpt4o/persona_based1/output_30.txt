Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  39  76  91  85  21  36  67
1  58  66  42  14  60  47  95  30
2  66  71  75  46  32  10  93  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 66 42 14 60 47 95 30]
 [66 71 75 46 32 10 93 28]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. We must allocate all 8 items to the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 24, 39, 76, 91, 85, 21, 36, 67
Agent 1: 58, 66, 42, 14, 60, 47, 95, 30
Agent 2: 66, 71, 75, 46, 32, 10, 93, 28
```

A productive approach here is to allocate items so that the sum of valuations each agent receives is as balanced as possible, potentially minimizing envy.

**Step 1: Prioritize High-Value Items**
For each item, we identify which agent values it the most.

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it most (66)
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it most (71)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it most (76)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it most (91)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it most (85)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it most (47)
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it most (95)
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it most (67)

**Step 2: Initial Allocation**
Based on the above priorities, an initial allocation might look like this:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

**Step 3: Adjust for Fairness**
Let's examine the total valuation for each agent under this allocation:
- Agent 0: 76 + 91 + 85 + 67 = 319
- Agent 1: 47 + 95 = 142
- Agent 2: 66 + 71 = 137

Agent 0 receives substantially higher value, while Agents 1 and 2 have much lower sums. To balance this, we can try reallocating some items.

**Step 4: Rebalance Allocation**
Reallocate to balance valuations better:
- Move Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1
- Move Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 2

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2, 5

**Step 5: Final Valuations Check**
- Agent 0: 91 + 67 = 158
- Agent 1: 85 + 95 = 180
- Agent 2: 66 + 71 + 75 + 47 = 259

This allocation gives a more balanced distribution of value, although not perfectly envy-free, it is a practical allocation given the constraints.

**Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 5]
}
```
