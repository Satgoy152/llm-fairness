Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  42  24  58  90   4  83  20
1   8  67  16  69  93  56  55  99
2  14  76  90  96  94  11  57  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and achieve envy-freeness, we can use a method like the Adjusted Winner procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the specific valuations, we can attempt a heuristic approach to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to minimize envy:

1. Start by identifying the items that provide the highest value for each agent.

2. Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual utility without causing significant envy.

Based on the valuations provided, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (90) and should receive it.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly (99) and should receive it.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (96) and should receive it.

Next, allocate the remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (58) and 1 (42) are highly valued.
- Agent 1: Items 5 (56) and 6 (55) are valuable.
- Agent 2: Items 2 (90) and 4 (94) are valuable.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their individual preferences:

Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
Agent 1: Items 5, 6, 7
Agent 2: Items 2, 3

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations, aiming for a fair division.
