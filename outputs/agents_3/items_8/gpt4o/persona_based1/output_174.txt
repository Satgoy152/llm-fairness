Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  98  89  28  80  22  11  33
1  33   0  36  43  39  25  40  60
2  80  41  47  58   2  85  16  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to assign the items in a manner where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

One method to achieve this is to use an algorithm that aims for envy-freeness, such as the Adjusted Winner procedure or similar approaches. However, since this is a computational problem with integer allocations, we can use a heuristic approach to balance the allocations based on the valuations.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - High values: 1 (98), 2 (89), 0 (79), 4 (80)

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - High values: 7 (60), 3 (43), 6 (40), 4 (39)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - High values: 0 (80), 5 (85), 3 (58), 2 (47)

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Start by allocating the items that have the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives a fair share by considering their next highest valuations.
3. Resolve conflicts by considering the next highest value and ensuring no agent is envious.

### Allocations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocate item 1 (98), item 0 (79), and item 2 (89). These are the top three valued items for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocate item 7 (60) and item 3 (43). These are the highest valued items for Agent 1 that have not been allocated to Agent 0.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Allocate item 5 (85) and item 6 (16). Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 2, and item 6 is the next available item.

- The remaining item 4 (80) can be allocated to Agent 0 to balance the allocations since Agent 0 values it highly, and it's not a top priority for Agents 1 and 2.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures all items are distributed.
