Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  89  68  46  34  18  46   6
1  88  61  92  41  89  83  12  85
2  69  94  64  86   4  97  81  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach to achieve this is to use an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and the total number of items is 8, let's attempt to find an allocation that is as fair as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 94 + 89 + 68 + 46 + 34 + 18 + 46 + 6 = 401
   - Agent 1: 88 + 61 + 92 + 41 + 89 + 83 + 12 + 85 = 551
   - Agent 2: 69 + 94 + 64 + 86 + 4 + 97 + 81 + 62 = 557

2. **Fair Share Calculation:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive 1/3 of the total valuation of all items:
   - Total valuation of all items = 401 + 551 + 557 = 1509
   - Fair share for each agent = 1509 / 3 = 503

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items in a manner that each agent's total valuation from their allocated items is as close as possible to their fair share (503), while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Let's try to allocate the items in a manner that balances the total valuation for each agent:

   - **Agent 0:** [0, 1, 5] 
     - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 94 (item 0) + 89 (item 1) + 18 (item 5) = 201

   - **Agent 1:** [2, 4, 7]
     - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 92 (item 2) + 89 (item 4) + 85 (item 7) = 266

   - **Agent 2:** [3, 6]
     - Total valuation for Agent 2 = 86 (item 3) + 81 (item 6) = 167

   Note: This allocation does not perfectly achieve the fair share (503 valuation) for each agent due to the constraints of integer item allocation, but it attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent bundles of items that are close to the others in terms of their relative valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
