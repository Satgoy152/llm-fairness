Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  58  94  37  53  38  40  68
1  59  65  16  19  85  60  86  68
2  50  76  13  69  10  58  51  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for the items and try to make sure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we'll aim for a solution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively high valuations for items 1, 3, and 5.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1, 3, and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, thereby aiming to reduce envy as much as possible under the given constraints.
