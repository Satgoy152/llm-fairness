Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  87  80  26  13  74  71  10
1  83  12  21  24  35  47  68  82
2  84  18  32  67  88  39  87  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [84 18 32 67 88 39 87 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility, while also trying to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. However, with only three agents and eight items, some trade-offs may need to be made.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: \(62 + 87 + 80 + 26 + 13 + 74 + 71 + 10 = 423\)
- Agent 1: \(83 + 12 + 21 + 24 + 35 + 47 + 68 + 82 = 372\)
- Agent 2: \(84 + 18 + 32 + 67 + 88 + 39 + 87 + 70 = 485\)

Next, let's assign items by considering the highest individual valuations for each item across agents to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly. 

Here is an allocation proposal that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 0 (62), 1 (87), 2 (80)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items 4 (35), 7 (82)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items 3 (67), 5 (39), 6 (87)

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items valued at: \(62 + 87 + 80 = 229\)
- Agent 1 receives items valued at: \(35 + 82 = 117\)
- Agent 2 receives items valued at: \(67 + 39 + 87 = 193\)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a combination of items that they value highly, given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
