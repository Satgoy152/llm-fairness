Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  66   6  59  51   0  21  20
1  50  31  14  50  27  21   5   8
2  66  23  71  45  45  46  51  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 31 14 50 27 21  5  8]
 [66 23 71 45 45 46 51 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [96, 66, 6, 59, 51, 0, 21, 20]
- Agent 1: [50, 31, 14, 50, 27, 21, 5, 8]
- Agent 2: [66, 23, 71, 45, 45, 46, 51, 20]

We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while trying to ensure no agent envies another's allocation. This is a challenging problem, but we can use a heuristic approach to get a reasonable allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 and item 1. Let's give Agent 0 these two items as they have the highest value for them compared to other items.

2. **Agent 2** highly values item 2. Let's give Agent 2 this item.

3. **Agent 1** values item 3 relatively highly. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

4. Now, consider remaining items [4, 5, 6, 7]. 

   - **Agent 2** has a high value for item 6, so let's give item 6 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 2** also values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 0** values item 4 highly compared to Agent 1, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Finally, item 7 can be allocated to **Agent 1** as they have some value for it and to balance the number of items.

Now, each agent has a fair share considering their valuations. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the preferences of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.
