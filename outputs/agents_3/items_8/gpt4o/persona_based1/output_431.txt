Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  10  28  52  20  93  76  80
1  71  90  17  67  79  27  68  83
2  73  30  83  95   3  21  90  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle. Below is a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 6 + 10 + 28 + 52 + 20 + 93 + 76 + 80 = 365
   - Agent 1: 71 + 90 + 17 + 67 + 79 + 27 + 68 + 83 = 502
   - Agent 2: 73 + 30 + 83 + 95 + 3 + 21 + 90 + 41 = 436

2. **Determine Fair Share for each Agent**: 
   - Fair share for Agent 0: 365 / 3 ≈ 121.67
   - Fair share for Agent 1: 502 / 3 ≈ 167.33
   - Fair share for Agent 2: 436 / 3 ≈ 145.33

3. **Allocate Items** based on maximizing each agent's perceived value while respecting their fair share and minimizing envy:

   - **Agent 0** (Fair share ≈ 121.67): 
     - Allocate items that maximize their value close to their fair share: Items [5, 6] (Value: 93 + 76 = 169)

   - **Agent 1** (Fair share ≈ 167.33): 
     - Allocate items that maximize their value close to their fair share: Items [0, 1, 4] (Value: 71 + 90 + 79 = 240)

   - **Agent 2** (Fair share ≈ 145.33):
     - Allocate items that maximize their value close to their fair share: Items [2, 3, 7] (Value: 83 + 95 + 41 = 219)

4. **Check Total Items Allocated**: 
   - Agent 0: [5, 6] (2 items)
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 4] (3 items)
   - Agent 2: [2, 3, 7] (3 items)
   - Total items = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 items

5. **Ensure No Agent Envy**: 
   - Agent 0 values their items at 169, which should be perceived as fair compared to others.
   - Agent 1 values their items at 240, which should be perceived as fair compared to others.
   - Agent 2 values their items at 219, which should be perceived as fair compared to others.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
