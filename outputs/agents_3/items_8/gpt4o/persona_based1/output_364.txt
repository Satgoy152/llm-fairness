Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  31  33  56  26  23  45  44
1  49  43   2  11  49  67  71  48
2  25  54  98  49  61  97   9   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Here is one possible allocation that tries to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: We will give Agent 0 the items they value highly compared to others. Items 2, 3, and 6 are highly valued by Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5 and item 7. They also value item 4 equally with Agent 0, so giving them item 4 can be fair as well.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 and item 0 relatively more than Agent 1.

The allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1 receives items: 4, 5, 7
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 1

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them.

{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
