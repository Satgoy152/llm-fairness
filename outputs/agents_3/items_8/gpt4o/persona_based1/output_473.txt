Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  40  54  80  24  20   7  64
1  60  80  49  98  32  47  81  15
2  82  27  85  44  57   0   0  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation. One common approach in fair division is to use a method like the "divide and choose" or "envy-free" mechanism. In this case, since we have 3 agents and 8 items, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [50, 40, 54, 80, 24, 20, 7, 64]
Agent 1: [60, 80, 49, 98, 32, 47, 81, 15]
Agent 2: [82, 27, 85, 44, 57, 0, 0, 40]
```

A possible strategy is to allocate items one by one based on the highest valuation that has not yet been assigned, taking care to balance the number of items each agent receives.

1. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98). Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (85). Assign to Agent 2.
3. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (82). Assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (80). Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (64). Assign to Agent 0.
6. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (57). Assign to Agent 2.
7. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (47). Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (81). Assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives: [7]
- Agent 1 receives: [3, 1, 5, 6]
- Agent 2 receives: [2, 0, 4]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3, 1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to their highest valuations in a way that minimizes envy.
