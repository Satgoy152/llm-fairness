Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  84  57  28   8  83  67  16
1  75  32  78  35  28  55  78  49
2  83  51  54  91  22  69  76  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can attempt to achieve an envy-free division. An allocation is envy-free if each agent prefers their own allocation over that of any other agent. Given the complexity of ensuring envy-freeness in all cases, especially with indivisible items, a common approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure, but here we will try a straightforward method that balances the total value each agent receives as best as possible.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent if they receive all the items:

- Agent 0: \(12 + 84 + 57 + 28 + 8 + 83 + 67 + 16 = 355\)
- Agent 1: \(75 + 32 + 78 + 35 + 28 + 55 + 78 + 49 = 430\)
- Agent 2: \(83 + 51 + 54 + 91 + 22 + 69 + 76 + 51 = 497\)

Now, let's attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign items based on the highest value for each item:
     - Item 0: Agent 2 (value 83)
     - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 84)
     - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 78)
     - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 91)
     - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 28)
     - Item 5: Agent 0 (value 83)
     - Item 6: Agent 1 (value 78)
     - Item 7: Agent 1 (value 49)

2. **Adjustment for Fairness:**
   - After initial allocation, check the total value for each agent and adjust:
     - Agent 0: Items [1, 5], Total value = 84 + 83 = 167
     - Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 6, 7], Total value = 78 + 28 + 78 + 49 = 233
     - Agent 2: Items [0, 3], Total value = 83 + 91 = 174

   - To balance further, consider swapping items where possible:
     - Swap item 6 (Agent 1, value 78) with item 0 (Agent 2, value 83):
       - New allocation:
         - Agent 0: [1, 5]
         - Agent 1: [2, 4, 7, 0]
         - Agent 2: [3, 6]

   - New total values:
     - Agent 0: 167
     - Agent 1: 78 + 28 + 49 + 83 = 238
     - Agent 2: 91 + 78 = 169

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Swap item 5 (Agent 0, value 83) with item 2 (Agent 1, value 78):
     - Final allocation:
       - Agent 0: [1, 2]
       - Agent 1: [4, 7, 0, 5]
       - Agent 2: [3, 6]

   - Final total values:
     - Agent 0: 84 + 57 = 141
     - Agent 1: 28 + 49 + 83 + 55 = 215
     - Agent 2: 91 + 76 = 167

This allocation balances the total values more evenly among the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 7, 0, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
