Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  85  30   4  29  61  80  86
1   3  11  86  27  56  60  70   0
2  95  27  46  35  12  14   7  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, the goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations, we can start by considering the preferences of each agent for the items. Here's a breakdown of each agent's highest-valued items:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 2 and moderate values for items 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2 has a high value for item 0 and moderate values for items 2, 3, and 7.

A potential allocation can be determined by trying to match these preferences while ensuring each agent gets approximately an equal number of items.

An allocation that minimizes envy can be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3

In this allocation, each agent receives three items, except for Agent 2, who receives two items. This allocation is not perfectly balanced in terms of the number of items, but we aim to balance the perceived value based on individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the envy-freeness criterion by giving each agent some of their most-valued items while keeping the total number of items allocated to eight.
