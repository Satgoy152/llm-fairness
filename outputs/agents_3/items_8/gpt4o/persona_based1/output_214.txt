Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  49  80  21   9  21  14  81
1  21   5  30  78  70  93  63  81
2  19  69  79  85  64  34  27  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their personal valuations. We'll try to find a balanced allocation where each agent values their allocated items at least as much as the items allocated to any other agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (80), 7 (81), 0 (71)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (93), 3 (78), 7 (81)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (85), 2 (79), 1 (69)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Items left: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7

5. **Balancing Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Already has item 2 (80)
     - Allocate item 0 (71) to Agent 0, as it is the next highest value for them.
   - Agent 1: Already has item 5 (93)
     - Allocate item 4 (70) to Agent 1, as it is the next highest value for them.
     - Allocate item 7 (81) to Agent 1, given it is highly valued by them.
   - Agent 2: Already has item 3 (85)
     - Allocate item 1 (69) to Agent 2, as it is the next highest value for them.
     - Allocate item 6 (27) to Agent 2, given it balances the total number of allocated items.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair number of items while trying to maintain an envy-free distribution based on their valuations.
