Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  40  13  74  52  16  90  70
1  53  11  63  49  54  58  63  90
2  21  40  90  15  66  73  98  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations. Given that there are only three agents and eight items, it's important to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6 (value of 90) and item 3 (value of 74). These items are significant in their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent places high value on item 7 (value of 90) and item 5 (value of 58). These items are crucial for balancing their total value.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 and item 7 the most, but since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, we need to consider other high-value items like item 2 (value of 90) and item 5 (value of 73).

Given these considerations, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2, 4

Let's verify the total valuations for each agent under this allocation:

- **Agent 0's Valuation**: 74 (item 3) + 90 (item 6) = 164
- **Agent 1's Valuation**: 58 (item 5) + 90 (item 7) = 148
- **Agent 2's Valuation**: 21 (item 0) + 40 (item 1) + 90 (item 2) + 66 (item 4) = 217

While exact envy-freeness might not be fully achieved due to the discrete and limited number of items, this allocation attempts to balance the overall perceived value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
