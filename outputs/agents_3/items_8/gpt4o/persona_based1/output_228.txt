Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  21  83  71  13   0  55  32
1  88  96  88  88  96  83  23  86
2  58  47  73  79  84  31  13   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 96 88 88 96 83 23 86]
 [58 47 73 79 84 31 13  0]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, I'll aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [39, 21, 83, 71, 13, 0, 55, 32]
- Agent 1: [88, 96, 88, 88, 96, 83, 23, 86]
- Agent 2: [58, 47, 73, 79, 84, 31, 13, 0]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the following:

1. Assign items that are uniquely most valuable to an agent.
2. Balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 2 (value 83)
  - Item 3 (value 71)
  - Item 6 (value 55)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0 (value 88)
  - Item 1 (value 96)
  - Item 4 (value 96)
  - Item 7 (value 86)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 5 (value 31)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, balancing as much as possible given the constraints:

- Agent 0 receives items worth a total of 209.
- Agent 1 receives items worth a total of 366.
- Agent 2 receives items worth a total of 31.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 7],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
