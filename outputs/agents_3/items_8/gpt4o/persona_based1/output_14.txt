Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78   6  31  29  36  73  31  18
1  35  24  51  43  22  97  94  57
2  32  67  18  21  41  24  63  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78  6 31 29 36 73 31 18]
 [35 24 51 43 22 97 94 57]
 [32 67 18 21 41 24 63 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes individual satisfaction. One common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent prefers their own allocation or values it at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agent \ Item | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
-------------|----------------------
0            | 78  6 31 29 36 73 31 18
1            | 35 24 51 43 22 97 94 57
2            | 32 67 18 21 41 24 63 91
```

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: Item 0 (78), item 5 (73)
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: Item 5 (97), item 6 (94)
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: Item 7 (91), item 1 (67)

We can attempt to allocate items based on these strong preferences, ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 5 and 6, so allocate them to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 7 highly, so allocate it to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** values item 0 highly, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest preferences:
  - Item 1 to Agent 2 (67), as it is their second-highest valued item.
  - Item 2 to Agent 0 (31), since Agent 0 values it the next most after item 0.
  - Item 3 to Agent 1 (43), as it is one of their next highest values.
  - Item 4 to Agent 0 (36), as it is among their higher-valued items.

### Allocation Result:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 5, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 7]

This allocation aims to satisfy each agent by providing them with items they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```
