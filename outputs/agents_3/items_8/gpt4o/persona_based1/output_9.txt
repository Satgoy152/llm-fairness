Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  36   4  76  24  20  66  12
1  24   0  75  47  85  90  31  61
2  13  17  16  45   3  53  34  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to find an allocation where each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and where possible, the allocation is envy-free. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, but we can attempt to allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution.

The total value for each agent is:

- Agent 0: \(99 + 36 + 4 + 76 + 24 + 20 + 66 + 12 = 337\)
- Agent 1: \(24 + 0 + 75 + 47 + 85 + 90 + 31 + 61 = 413\)
- Agent 2: \(13 + 17 + 16 + 45 + 3 + 53 + 34 + 86 = 267\)

The average value per item for each agent (total value divided by 8 items) is:

- Agent 0: \(337/8 = 42.125\)
- Agent 1: \(413/8 = 51.625\)
- Agent 2: \(267/8 = 33.375\)

An initial approach is to assign the items to maximize each agent's total valuation, aiming for each agent to have a fair share based on their preferences. We will try to allocate items so that each agent's total valuation is as close to their average value per item as possible.

\[ \text{Allocation strategy:} \]

1. Sort items based on each agent's valuation from highest to lowest.
2. Allocate items iteratively to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8 and each agent receives a fair share.

Following this strategy, we can perform the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3 (total value = 99 + 76 = 175)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5, 2 (total value = 85 + 90 + 75 = 250)
- Agent 2: Items 7, 6, 1 (total value = 86 + 34 + 17 = 137)

This allocation provides a distribution where each agent receives items that they value highly, ensuring a fair division. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 2],
    "2": [7, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent their fair share based on their valuations, while striving to minimize envy.
