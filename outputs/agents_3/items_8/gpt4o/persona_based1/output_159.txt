Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  62  28  74  77   7  17  96
1  15  31  25  93  35  67  82   1
2  29  10  20  14  98  99   2  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 31 25 93 35 67 82  1]
 [29 10 20 14 98 99  2 51]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the three agents, we'll aim for an allocation that is envy-free and efficient. We will analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent values their allocation highly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Determine Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items: 7 (96), 4 (77), 3 (74).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items: 3 (93), 6 (82), 5 (67).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items: 5 (99), 4 (98), 7 (51).

2. **Initial Allocation (based on highest value per agent):**
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

3. **Continue Assigning Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 next highest preference: item 4.
   - Agent 1 next highest preference: item 6.
   - Agent 2 next highest preference: item 4 (already taken by Agent 0) and item 7 (already taken by Agent 0).

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest: 62).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest: 50).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest: 25).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest: 82).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest: 98).

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 7
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 3, 6
- **Agent 2:** Items 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and attempts to balance their preferences to reduce envy.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items with the goal of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
