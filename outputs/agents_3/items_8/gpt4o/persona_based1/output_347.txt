Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  43  87  50  58  71   0  16
1  11   9  52  47  45   0  99  17
2  66  79  93  61  99  27  53  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 43 87 50 58 71  0 16]
 [11  9 52 47 45  0 99 17]
 [66 79 93 61 99 27 53 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to use the "round robin" allocation method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item until all items are allocated.

Let's see how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [84, 43, 87, 50, 58, 71, 0, 16]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [11, 9, 52, 47, 45, 0, 99, 17]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [66, 79, 93, 61, 99, 27, 53, 93]

We'll proceed with the allocation:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 87).
  - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 99).
  - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 99).

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 84).
  - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 47).
  - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 93).

- **Round 3:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 71).
  - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 9).

Now, all 8 items are allocated. Each agent's allocation ensures that their most valued available items are prioritized, and since they pick sequentially, this helps in maintaining envy-freeness to a reasonable extent.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 5],
    "1": [6, 3, 1],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```
