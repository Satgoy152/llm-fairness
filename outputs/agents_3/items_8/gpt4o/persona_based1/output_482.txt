Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  45  13  61  40  27  12  40
1  15  66  74  84   1   6  14  99
2   0  88  79  53  62  35  70   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that each agent values their own bundle the most, or at least as much as they would value any other agent's bundle.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: Values item 3 highly (61)
   - Agent 1: Values item 7 highly (99)
   - Agent 2: Values items 1 and 2 highly (88 and 79)

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0
   - Give item 7 to Agent 1
   - Give items 1 and 2 to Agent 2

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign remaining items considering the next highest values for each agent and ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 42, which is higher than other agents.
  - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 27, which is higher than other agents.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the least but has already received a high-value item.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 70, which is higher than other agents.

Final allocations should aim to distribute items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Here is one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their own bundle while ensuring that all items are allocated.
