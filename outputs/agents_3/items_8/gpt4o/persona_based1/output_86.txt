Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  12  82  10  66  73  22  34
1  51  54  74   9  44  44  36  73
2  70  61  92  80  70  38  46  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "round-robin" allocation or "Greedy" allocation. The goal is to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents, which is a common approach to achieve fairness in allocation problems. Here, I will use a simplified approach to allocate items based on each agent's valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with all items unallocated and all agents having an empty list of items.

2. **Allocation Strategy**: We will assign items one by one to the agents based on the highest available value for each agent. Each agent will take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool of items.

3. **Round-robin Selection**:
   - Agent 0 picks first, followed by Agent 1, then Agent 2, and so on, cycling back to Agent 0 once all agents have picked in that round.

4. **Execution**:
   - **Round 1**:
     - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 82).
     - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 73).
     - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 92) which is already taken, so the next highest, item 3 (value 80).

   - **Round 2**:
     - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 73).
     - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 51).
     - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 79) which is already taken, so the next highest available item 4 (value 70).

   - **Round 3**:
     - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 66) which is already taken, so the next highest, item 6 (value 22).
     - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 36) which is already taken, so the next highest, item 1 (value 54).
     - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 38) which is already taken, so the next highest, item 0 (value 70).

### Final Allocation:
After completing the allocation process, we have allocated all 8 items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [7, 0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, minimizing envy among the agents.
