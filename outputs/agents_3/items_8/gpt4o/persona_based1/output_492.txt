Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  97  54  28  25  26  56   8
1  74  86  22  52  69  49  41  90
2  44  63  39  81  44  99  51  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their valuations. This is a complex problem, but one approach to achieve a fair division is to maximize the total utility for each agent such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

Letâ€™s analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 28
  - Item 4: 25
  - Item 5: 26
  - Item 6: 56
  - Item 7: 8

- Agent 1 values items:
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 52
  - Item 4: 69
  - Item 5: 49
  - Item 6: 41
  - Item 7: 90

- Agent 2 values items:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 44
  - Item 5: 99
  - Item 6: 51
  - Item 7: 66

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes fairness:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 7 (90) and item 0 (74).
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 (99) and item 3 (81).
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (97) and item 6 (56).

Given these considerations, the allocation can be approached by assigning high-value items to the agents who value them the most:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0

After assigning the most valued items, we need to continue distributing the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation after item 7)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (high valuation)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (third highest valuation after items 1 and 6)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 has a better valuation compared to other unallocated items for Agent 0)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (final item, and Agent 0 has a decent valuation for it)

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly while attempting to balance overall satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items in a manner that attempts to respect the preferences of each agent and aims to minimize envy.
