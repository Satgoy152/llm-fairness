Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   2   5   9   4  64  13  10
1  24  40  66  89  38  57  24  62
2  31  79  22  39   8  91  52  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we want to allocate items to the agents in such a way that the allocation is as fair as possible. A common fairness criterion is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate items by considering maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step process to reach a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:** 
   - Agent 0 has a very high valuation for item 0 (99) and item 5 (64).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (89), item 2 (66), and item 7 (62).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 5 (91) and item 1 (79).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0 because they value it the most.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1 because they value it the most.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2 because they value it the most.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation.

4. **Check Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 5, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives while ensuring that each item is allocated to the agent who values it relatively highly.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent items they highly value, aiming for a fair division based on the given valuations.
