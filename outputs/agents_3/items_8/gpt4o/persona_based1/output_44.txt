Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  44  58  92  52  75  55   5
1  76  98  71  51  31  27  94  52
2  95  41  56  18  65  61  37  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as what others have received.

Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 3 (92) and item 0 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 1 (98) and item 6 (94).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuation for item 0 (95) and item 4 (65).

Given the valuations, a way to allocate the items is as follows:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 7 to Agent 0, as they have high valuation for item 3 and also value item 0 significantly.
- Assign items 1, 6, and 5 to Agent 1, as they value item 1 the most, and item 6 significantly. Item 5 balances their allocation.
- Assign items 4 and 2 to Agent 2, as they value item 4 highly and item 2 reasonably.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 6, 5],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation uses all 8 items and attempts to distribute them in a way that reflects the agents' valuations, providing each agent with items they highly value.
