Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  32  44  79  47  75  96  29
1  77   8  23  32  86  38  86  60
2  40  11  64  37  25  75  54  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77  8 23 32 86 38 86 60]
 [40 11 64 37 25 75 54 31]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will aim to allocate the items in a manner that is envy-free, meaning that each agent should feel that their allocated set of items is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation given their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations and determine a fair allocation:

### Valuations Table
```
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Agent 0: 98  32  44  79  47  75  96  29
Agent 1: 77   8  23  32  86  38  86  60
Agent 2: 40  11  64  37  25  75  54  31
```

### Steps Towards Fair Allocation

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Begin with allocating items that have significantly higher valuations for certain agents.

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Values item 0 very highly (98), and item 6 highly (96).
   - Allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 4 highly (86), and item 6 equally (86), but item 6 is already allocated.
   - Allocate items 4 and 7 (60) to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 5 (75) the highest after Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Remaining items 2 and 3 have highest relative value to Agent 2.
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Check Total Allocation**: Ensure each agent has items and all 8 items are allocated. 

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [5, 2, 3, 1]

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 2, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
