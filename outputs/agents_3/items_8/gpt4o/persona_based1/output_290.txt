Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  54   9  98  10  31  45  50
1  53  91  48   2  61  27  21  76
2   0   7  87  10  63  44  42  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their personal valuations.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (98), followed by item 1 (54). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (91), followed by item 7 (76).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (87), followed by item 4 (63).

Let's attempt a round-robin allocation based on these preferences:

- **Round 1**:
  - Agent 0 takes item 3.
  - Agent 1 takes item 1.
  - Agent 2 takes item 2.

- **Round 2**:
  - Agent 0 takes item 5 (31).
  - Agent 1 takes item 7 (76).
  - Agent 2 takes item 4 (63).

- **Final Allocations**:
  - Agent 0 takes item 6 (45).
  - Agent 1 takes item 0 (53).
  - Agent 2 takes item 7 (58).

Now, let's ensure that each agent has a fair allocation based on their preferences. We can adjust slightly to make sure everyone has a roughly balanced distribution of items based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to be envy-free to the extent possible given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items. Each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and the distribution tries to keep the overall perceived value balanced.
