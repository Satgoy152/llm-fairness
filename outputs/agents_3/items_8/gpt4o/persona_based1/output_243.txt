Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  21  58  66  81  22  16  37
1  29   9  20  71  84   7  68  89
2  54  72  34  22  57   6  80  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 21 58 66 81 22 16 37]
 [29  9 20 71 84  7 68 89]
 [54 72 34 22 57  6 80 78]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free and efficient allocation. In this context, an allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle. We also aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [72, 21, 58, 66, 81, 22, 16, 37]
Agent 1: [29, 9, 20, 71, 84, 7, 68, 89]
Agent 2: [54, 72, 34, 22, 57, 6, 80, 78]
```

A simple approach to achieve a fair division is to use a round-robin allocation or a similar method that takes into account each agent's preferences.

### Allocation Process:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it to them if it's not already taken.
2. Repeatedly allocate the next best item available for each agent in turns.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 4 (value 81). Allocate item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 7 (value 89). Allocate item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 6 (value 80). Allocate item 6.

Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5

4. **Agent 0**: Next highest valued item is 0 (value 72). Allocate item 0.
5. **Agent 1**: Next highest valued item is 3 (value 71). Allocate item 3.
6. **Agent 2**: Next highest valued item is 1 (value 72). Allocate item 1.

Remaining items: 2, 5

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest valued item is 2 (value 58). Allocate item 2.
8. **Agent 1**: Only remaining item is 5. Allocate item 5.

### Final Allocation:

```
Agent 0: Items [4, 0, 2]
Agent 1: Items [7, 3, 5]
Agent 2: Items [6, 1]
```

This allocation is fair based on the given valuations and ensures each agent gets their highest possible valued items available in each turn.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 2],
    "1": [7, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 1]
}
```
