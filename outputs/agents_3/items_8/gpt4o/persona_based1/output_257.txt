Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  17  29  63   6  21  99  90
1  47  59  42   2  68  65  34  60
2  24  90  51   7  97  15  21  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 59 42  2 68 65 34 60]
 [24 90 51  7 97 15 21 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we seek an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to maximize the total perceived value each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that the allocation remains envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

After analyzing the valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 3, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 values items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 reasonably.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 1, 4, and 7, and moderately values item 2.

An allocation aiming to balance these considerations while trying to keep a high perceived total value for each agent might look like this:

- Assign items 0, 3, 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 2, 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 4, 7 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, trying to keep the allocation as close to envy-free as possible.
