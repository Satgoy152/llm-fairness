Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39   1  90  89  36  38  16  28
1  53  65  39  53  31  49  49  68
2  19  79  41  50  98  28  62  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their overall valuation perspective.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. This step ensures that each item is initially placed with the agent who assigns it the highest utility.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: If any agent is envious of another's allocation, we may need to adjust the allocations slightly to ensure fairness. This may involve swapping items between agents to reduce or eliminate envy.

4. **Balance the Number of Items**: Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, not every agent can receive an equal number of items. We aim for each agent to have as close to an equal number of items as possible while maintaining fairness.

Let's perform these steps:

**Valuations Matrix**:
```
Agent 0: [39, 1, 90, 89, 36, 38, 16, 28]
Agent 1: [53, 65, 39, 53, 31, 49, 49, 68]
Agent 2: [19, 79, 41, 50, 98, 28, 62, 45]
```

**Initial Allocation**:
- Item 0: Agent 1 (53)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (79)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (90)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (89)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (98)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (49)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (62)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (68)

**Initial Allocations**:
- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 4, 6]

Now let's check for envy and balance the number of items:

- Agents 0 and 2 have 2 items each, while Agent 1 has 3 items.
- Check if any agent is envious of another's allocation.

To balance and ensure fairness, we need to give one more item to Agent 0. After analyzing values and potential swaps, let's finalize the allocation.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 4, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the items and maintain fairness among the agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
