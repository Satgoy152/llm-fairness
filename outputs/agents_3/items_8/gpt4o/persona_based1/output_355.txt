Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  25  57  81  70  57  62  74
1  48  51  60  94  82  22  28  47
2  37  18  49  91  85  63  92  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent values their allocation. One common approach is to use the envy-free criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:  
   - Agent 0: 75 + 25 + 57 + 81 + 70 + 57 + 62 + 74 = 501
   - Agent 1: 48 + 51 + 60 + 94 + 82 + 22 + 28 + 47 = 432
   - Agent 2: 37 + 18 + 49 + 91 + 85 + 63 + 92 + 83 = 518

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item. This helps in reducing envy as each item goes to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (75).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (25).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (60).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (63).
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (92).
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (83).

4. **Check and Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item and that the distribution is as balanced as possible. If one agent has no items, allocate the least valued item from another agent.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items [4, 5, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, thus minimizing envy.

Here is the final JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, respecting the preferences of each agent as much as possible.
