Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  26  35  63  21  54  75  42
1  77  73  87  30  68  34  65  36
2   5   0  78  75  79  20   6  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim for an allocation that is both envy-free and efficient, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (92)
   - Next highest values: Item 6 (75), Item 3 (63), Item 5 (54), Item 7 (42)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (87)
   - Next highest values: Item 0 (77), Item 1 (73), Item 4 (68), Item 6 (65)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - Highest value: Item 7 (91)
   - Next highest values: Item 4 (79), Item 3 (75), Item 2 (78)

Based on the above, let's propose an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Given the high valuation for item 0, it's logical to allocate item 0 to agent 0. Next, we can consider items 6 and 3, which also have relatively high valuations for agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so item 2 should be allocated to agent 1. Following that, items 1 and 4 are highly valued by agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 the most, so item 7 should go to agent 2. Additionally, items 4 and 3 hold high value for agent 2.

Let's finalize the allocation while ensuring no overlap and that all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 6, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 1]
- **Agent 2**: [7, 4, 3]

This distribution accounts for each agent's top preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [7, 4, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the preferences of each agent based on their highest valuations while distributing all items.
