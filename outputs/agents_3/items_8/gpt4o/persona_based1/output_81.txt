Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  45  26  99  97  21  24  14
1  56  70  70  66  34  36  42  51
2  19  55  37  82  36  47  21  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

Let's consider the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. We'll start by allocating item 3 (value 99) to agent 0 since it's their highest valued item.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 and 2. We'll allocate item 2 (value 70) to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 3 and 5, but since item 3 is already allocated, we'll assign item 5 (value 47) to agent 2.

Now, let's proceed with the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0** has already received item 3. We will now add item 4 (value 97) to agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** will receive item 1 (value 70), a high-valued item for them.
6. **Agent 2** will receive item 7 (value 51), which is the next highest value remaining.

Two items are still unallocated: items 0 and 6.

7. **Agent 0** will receive item 0 (value 90), which is high value for them.
8. **Agent 2** will receive item 6 (value 21).

Now, each agent has received at least two items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and helps minimize envy among agents. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
