Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  90  10  84  39  66  30  76
1  11  67  45  93  98  12  63  22
2  69  28  10  22  32  99  28   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [69 28 10 22 32 99 28  9]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, if possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0: 37, 1: 90, 2: 10, 3: 84, 4: 39, 5: 66, 6: 30, 7: 76
- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0: 11, 1: 67, 2: 45, 3: 93, 4: 98, 5: 12, 6: 63, 7: 22
- Agent 2 values items:
  - 0: 69, 1: 28, 2: 10, 3: 22, 4: 32, 5: 99, 6: 28, 7: 9

Based on these valuations, a possible approach is to prioritize allocations such that each agent receives items they value highly compared to other agents. This might help in minimizing envy among agents.

Let's consider the following allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations for items: 1 (90), 3 (84), 7 (76)
   - Assign items 1, 3, and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations for items: 4 (98), 3 (93), 6 (63)
   - Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations for items: 5 (99), 0 (69)
   - Assign items 5 and 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 2 (10) to Agent 2 as well, since it's valued equally by all agents.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations, which should help reduce envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 0, 2]
}
```
