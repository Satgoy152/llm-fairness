Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  76   1  10  73  48  70  45
1  66  57  11  50  40  21   0  26
2  77  60  72  68  10   1  13   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and attempt to ensure envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using a fair division algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure or similar methods. Given the valuations provided, an approach to allocate items could be as follows:

1. **Maximize individual happiness:** Try to ensure each agent gets items they value highly.
2. **Fair distribution:** Ensure that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (76), followed by item 0 (37) and item 4 (73).
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (66), followed by item 1 (57) and item 3 (50).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (77), followed by item 2 (72) and item 3 (68).

A possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them and less so by others.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 and Agent 2 have lower valuations for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is one of their higher-valued items.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their second-highest valued item.
- The remaining items (5, 6, 7) can be allocated among the agents to balance the number of items each receives and ensure distribution fairness.

Here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets two items, including their most valued one.
- Agent 1 gets three items, including one of their top three valued items.
- Agent 2 gets three items, including their top two valued items.

This allocation attempts to balance the fairness by ensuring each agent gets a share of the items that align with their valuations while distributing the total number of items equally or nearly equally.
