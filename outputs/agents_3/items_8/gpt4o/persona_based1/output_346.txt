Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  31  98  69  12  18  62  53
1  79  17  17  41  51  36  33   9
2  12   0  81  35  47  54  77  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12  0 81 35 47 54 77 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This involves ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items, given their valuations.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 3 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent should ideally receive approximately 2-3 items because \( \frac{8 \text{ items}}{3 \text{ agents}} \approx 2.67 \).

2. **Valuation Table:**

   ```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   0  62  31  98  69  12  18  62  53
   1  79  17  17  41  51  36  33   9
   2  12   0  81  35  47  54  77  87
   ```

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We aim to maximize the minimum total valuation that each agent receives, ensuring they do not envy the others.
   
4. **Agent Preferences:**

   - **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 2 (98), 3 (69), and 0 (62).
   - **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 0 (79), 4 (51), and 5 (36).
   - **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 7 (87), 6 (77), and 2 (81).

5. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 2 as they are both highly valued by these agents and not contested by others.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by Agent 1 and less so by others.
   - Allocate the remaining items while maintaining balance and minimizing envy.

6. **Final Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0:** Items 2, 3
   - **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 4
   - **Agent 2:** Items 5, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes envy across the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
