Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3  4   5   6   7
0  71  72   0  72  4  42  17  13
1  33  58  32  52  3  35  83  22
2  20  47  89  16  4  51   4  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is said to be envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step outline of how we might approach this problem:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.
   - There are 3 agents and 8 items, so an equitable distribution would be approximately 2-3 items per agent.

2. **Goal:**
   - Try to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle they value highly, while also balancing the total value among agents.

3. **Strategy:**
   - We start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no two agents receive the same item. We proceed iteratively, considering the next highest available item for each agent.

4. **Allocation Process:**

   - **Agent 0:** Highest value items are 1, 0, and 3. We assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 initially.
   - **Agent 1:** Highest value items are 6, 1, and 3. Since item 1 is already taken, we assign items 6 and 3 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2:** Highest value items are 2, 5, and 1. Since items 1 and 3 are taken, we assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.

5. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items:**

   - Remaining items are 4 and 7. We observe the following:
     - Agent 0 values item 7 higher than item 4.
     - Agent 1 values item 4 higher than item 7.
     - Agent 2 has equal low valuation for both items.

   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Final Allocation Check:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated and that each agent has an integer number of items.
   - Check for minimization of envy by ensuring agents have relatively equitable total valuations.

Here's the allocation that results from this process:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [3, 6, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects integer distribution, ensuring all items are allocated, and aims for minimization of envy based on the given valuations.
