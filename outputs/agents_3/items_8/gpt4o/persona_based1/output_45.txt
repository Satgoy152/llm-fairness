Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  63  12  61  58  79  20  74
1  78  16  52  96   1  12  78  20
2  29  25  69  45  88  76  67  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We can use the valuations provided to try to achieve this goal. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive approximately 2 to 3 items.

Let's go through a potential allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (79), Item 7 (74), Item 3 (61)
   - Allocate Item 5 and Item 7 to Agent 0, as these are among the highest values and should maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 0 (78), Item 6 (78)
   - Allocate Item 3 and Item 0 to Agent 1, as these are the highest values for them.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (88), Item 5 (76), Item 6 (67)
   - Allocate Item 4 and Item 6 to Agent 2, as these are the highest values for them.

Now, let's handle the remaining items:

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 1 and 2 are left. 
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 at 25 and Item 2 at 69, which are higher than Agent 0's and Agent 1's valuations for these items.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it highly.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it balances the number of items, and Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 does.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the agents' preferences based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items.
