Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  67  36  18  96  45  30  22
1  31   9  43  14   0  43   8   2
2  33  13  70  57  52  75  72  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31  9 43 14  0 43  8  2]
 [33 13 70 57 52 75 72 83]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free assignment where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as those of the others. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, we can aim to create allocations that are as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 94, 67, 36, 18, 96, 45, 30, 22
- Agent 1: 31, 9, 43, 14, 0, 43, 8, 2
- Agent 2: 33, 13, 70, 57, 52, 75, 72, 83

A useful strategy is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation from their assigned items, while considering balance. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **High Value Items**: Allocate items with the highest values to the agents that value them most:
   - Item 0 (value 94 for agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Item 4 (value 96 for agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Item 5 (value 75 for agent 2) to agent 2.

2. **Next Highest Values**: Continue allocating based on the next highest values:
   - Item 7 (value 83 for agent 2) to agent 2.
   - Item 2 (value 70 for agent 2) to agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items**: Allocate remaining items to balance the number of items per agent:
   - Item 1 (value 67 for agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Item 3 (value 14 for agent 1) to agent 1.
   - Item 6 (value 72 for agent 2) to agent 2.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 5, 6, and 7.

Let's present the final allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
