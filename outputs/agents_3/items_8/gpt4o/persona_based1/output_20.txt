Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  42  47  20  89  55  54  44
1  49  11  15  98  56  35  98   1
2  18  78  41   5  58  30  35  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [18 78 41  5 58 30 35 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. Given the valuations, a common approach is to use a round-robin method where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Turn**: 
   - Most valued item: 4 (Value 89)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1's Turn**:
   - Most valued item: 3 (Value 98)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's Turn**:
   - Most valued item: 7 (Value 96)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 0's Turn**:
   - Remaining most valued item: 2 (Value 47)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1's Turn**:
   - Remaining most valued item: 6 (Value 98)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2's Turn**:
   - Remaining most valued item: 1 (Value 78)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

7. **Agent 0's Turn**:
   - Remaining most valued item: 5 (Value 55)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 1's Turn**:
   - Remaining item: 0
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 4, 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 6, 0
- Agent 2 receives items: 7, 1

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, minimizing envy.
