Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  41  72  81  65  34  73   1
1  43  67  72  99  72  57  94  47
2  26  77  75  23  68  82   1  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. An allocation is envy-free if no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own. 

Let's proceed with a simple approach to approximate envy-freeness by considering each agent's highest-valued items and assigning them accordingly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (81), so let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 6 (73), allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1's allocation:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, but it is already allocated, so we move to the next highest, item 6, which is also allocated.
   - Next, item 2 (72) is highest for Agent 1 not yet allocated. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Then, allocate item 4 (72) to Agent 1, as it is the next highest available item for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's allocation:**
   - Agent 2 values item 5 (82) the highest. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Next, item 1 (77) is highest for Agent 2 not yet allocated. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Then, allocate item 4 (68) to Agent 2, but it is already allocated, so we move to item 0 (26).

4. **Check remaining items:**
   - Items 0 and 7 are still unallocated.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as they have a decent valuation for it (59).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as they value it more (47) than others.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the highest valuations by each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
