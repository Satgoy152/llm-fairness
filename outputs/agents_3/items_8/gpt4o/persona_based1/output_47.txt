Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  45  94  59  64  27   1  28
1  31   6  66  60  28  25  57  42
2  81  59  78  15  71  58  15   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate all items to the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. One common approach to achieve this is the "round-robin" method or to use a variation of it, ensuring each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly, particularly item 2 (94) and item 0 (86).
- Agent 1 values item 2 (66) the most and also item 6 (57).
- Agent 2 values item 0 (81) and item 2 (78) the most.

Given these valuations, a possible fair allocation can be approached by considering each agent's preferences and attempting to reduce potential envy.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. Start by allocating the most valuable items according to each agent's preference, ensuring no agent gets their top two preferences if it would cause significant envy.
2. Try to balance the allocation so that the total value for each agent is approximately equal.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- **Agent 0:** They value item 2 the most, but since item 2 is highly valued by all, it's better to allocate it to someone else. They can receive item 0 and item 3, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1:** Item 2 is their top preference among the others, so it makes sense for them to receive it. Additionally, they can receive item 7.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate item 1 and item 4 to them, which they value reasonably well.

Now, let's do a final check to ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 7].
- Agent 2 receives items [1, 4, 5, 6].

This allocation ensures all items are distributed. Let's format it as required:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the preferences and total values received by each agent, aiming for a fair distribution.
