Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  70  38  98  56   6  78  28
1  32   8  18  85  67  35  68  80
2  74  54  10  57  69  26  85  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and minimizing envy, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the Total Value Each Agent Places on All Items:**  
   - Agent 0's total value: 63 + 70 + 38 + 98 + 56 + 6 + 78 + 28 = 437
   - Agent 1's total value: 32 + 8 + 18 + 85 + 67 + 35 + 68 + 80 = 393
   - Agent 2's total value: 74 + 54 + 10 + 57 + 69 + 26 + 85 + 34 = 409

2. **Distribute Items to Maximize Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   The goal is to allocate items such that agents are as satisfied as possible according to their valuations.

3. **Initial Item Assignment:**  
   Start by assigning each agent their highest valued items and continue until all items are allocated. This is a simplified greedy approach, which won't always ensure envy-freeness but provides a good start.

4. **Adjust Allocation to Minimize Envy:**  
   After the initial allocation, check for possible adjustments that can reduce envy without decreasing the total value of each agent's allocation.

Based on the above steps, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Receives items [0, 1, 2], maximizing high-value items for this agent initially.
- **Agent 1:** Receives items [3, 7], focusing on high-value items for this agent.
- **Agent 2:** Receives items [4, 5, 6], ensuring this agent also receives items of high personal value.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the highest value items for each agent while distributing all 8 items. Adjustments can further be made if required to ensure minimal envy among agents.
