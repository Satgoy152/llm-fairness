Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  23  10  84  21  40  52  63
1   5   7  51  14  93  27  15  39
2   8  67  80   9  61  88  99   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 67 80  9 61 88 99  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate items in a way that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations to find a fair allocation:

Agent 0: [62, 23, 10, 84, 21, 40, 52, 63]  
Agent 1: [5, 7, 51, 14, 93, 27, 15, 39]  
Agent 2: [8, 67, 80, 9, 61, 88, 99, 0]  

Considering these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced and no agent envies another. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (84), so we can give them item 3. They also value items 0, 5, and 7 relatively well, so they get these as well.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 very highly (93), so they should receive item 4. They also have a relatively high valuation for item 2, so they get this item too.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for items 6 and 5, so they should receive these. They also value item 1 relatively well, so they get this item too.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 4]
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
