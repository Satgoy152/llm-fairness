Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  15  41   5  95  54  36  51
1  40  80  29  88  76  59  18  15
2  81  97  92  72  54  98  59  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 80 29 88 76 59 18 15]
 [81 97 92 72 54 98 59 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we can aim to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they wouldn't prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Considering the given valuations, let's apply a simple round-robin method while prioritizing items with higher valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (97)
   - Next highest: Item 4 (95)
   - Third highest: Item 5 (54)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (80)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (88)
   - Third highest: Item 4 (76)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (98)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (97)
   - Third highest: Item 2 (92)

Now, let's allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring each agent receives a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0 (97), Item 4 (95)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 1 (80), Item 3 (88)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 5 (98), Item 2 (92), Item 6 (59), Item 7 (40)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their highest valuations, helping to achieve a fair and envy-free division. 

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
