Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  27  17  61  14  82  45  37
1  37  93  19  30   4  16  31  86
2  21  11  88  80  58  14  47  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 27 17 61 14 82 45 37]
 [37 93 19 30  4 16 31 86]
 [21 11 88 80 58 14 47 28]]
Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent feels they received at least as good a bundle of items as any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations matrix to determine the best allocation:

```
Agent 0: [21, 27, 17, 61, 14, 82, 45, 37]
Agent 1: [37, 93, 19, 30,  4, 16, 31, 86]
Agent 2: [21, 11, 88, 80, 58, 14, 47, 28]
```

Step 1: Identify the highest valued item for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (82).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (93).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (88).

Step 2: Reserve these items for each respective agent to minimize immediate envy.

Step 3: Allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest values and ensuring no agent is left feeling envious.

The allocation process can be somewhat heuristic due to the need to balance multiple interests, but let's try to achieve a reasonable distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 6

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while respecting their top priorities. Let's see the resulting allocations:

- Agent 0: [5, 0, 3] with values [82, 21, 61] totaling 164.
- Agent 1: [1, 7] with values [93, 86] totaling 179.
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 6] with values [88, 58, 47] totaling 193.

This allocation respects each agent's top priorities and attempts to minimize the potential for envy. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
