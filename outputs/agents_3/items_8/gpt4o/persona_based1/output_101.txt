Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  11  73   2  95  31  48   7
1  51  21  14  59  22  79  80  43
2  93  92  43  23  41  39  18  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy among the agents. One such method is the "Envy-Free Item Allocation" approach. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations matrix, we have:

- Agent 0: [67, 11, 73, 2, 95, 31, 48, 7]
- Agent 1: [51, 21, 14, 59, 22, 79, 80, 43]
- Agent 2: [93, 92, 43, 23, 41, 39, 18, 70]

The challenge is to distribute these 8 items in a manner that maximizes perceived fairness. One possible approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of total value.

Let's allocate items in a manner that tries to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (93) and item 1 (92), so these can be allocated to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (95), so it can be allocated to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (79), so it can be allocated to Agent 1.
4. Now, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest values preferred by agents without causing envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 4]
- **Agent 1**: [5, 6, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1, 3]

This allocation considers the highest preferences for each agent and attempts to balance the overall value received by each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items they highly value, thereby minimizing envy and ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
