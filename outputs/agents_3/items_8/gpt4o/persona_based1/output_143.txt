Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  96  92  45  60  11  32  90
1  84  43  99  53  25  27  47   4
2  70  48  23  21  26  97  39  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we want to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While it is often difficult to achieve perfect envy-freeness, we can try to approximate it by considering each agent's valuation and distributing items in a way that maximizes their perceived value.

Let's outline a strategy:

1. **Initial Analysis:** Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to gauge their overall interests.

2. **Item-by-Item Allocation:** Go through each item, and allocate it to the agent who values it the most. This method aims to maximize individual satisfaction.

3. **Reassessment:** After the initial allocation, check if any agent has a significantly lower total value of allocated items compared to others, and make adjustments if possible to balance.

Let's implement this strategy:

**Valuation Summary:**
- Agent 0 total valuation: 458
- Agent 1 total valuation: 382
- Agent 2 total valuation: 356

**Allocation Steps:**
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest at 84. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 96. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 99. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 45. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 60. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest at 97. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it highest at 47. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it highest at 90. Allocate to Agent 0.

**Checking Balance:**
- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4, 7] with total valuation of 291.
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 6] with total valuation of 230.
- Agent 2: Items [5] with total valuation of 97.

There is a significant imbalance, particularly for Agent 2. Let's adjust by swapping some items to improve fairness:

1. Move Item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 2:
   - Agent 0 loses 96, Agent 2 gains 48 (total: 145 for Agent 2).
2. Move Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 2:
   - Agent 0 loses 60, Agent 2 gains 26 (total: 171 for Agent 2).

**Adjusted Allocations:**
- Agent 0: Items [3, 7] with total valuation of 135.
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 6] with total valuation of 230.
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4, 5] with total valuation of 171.

The distribution is now more balanced, considering the limitations of integer allocations and individual item valuations.

**Final Allocations:**
```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
