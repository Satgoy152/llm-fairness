Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  70  45   3  19  19  14  39
1  70  20  76  80  45  19  29  51
2  82  35  83  61  91  38  93  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure approximate fairness, given the constraints of integer allocations. 

One common approach to achieve fair division is to use an algorithm that minimizes envy, such as the envy-free up to one item (EF1) allocation. This means each agent should not envy another agent's bundle more than one item.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

Agent 0 values:
- Total value: 249
- Highest valued items: 1 (70), 0 (40), 2 (45)

Agent 1 values:
- Total value: 390
- Highest valued items: 3 (80), 2 (76), 0 (70)

Agent 2 values:
- Total value: 498
- Highest valued items: 6 (93), 4 (91), 2 (83)

Following a simple allocation strategy that tries to maximize individual satisfaction based on the highest-valued items and keeping in mind the total number of items, I propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 4, 6, 7

This allocation attempts to balance the total values each agent receives and minimize envy between agents by giving them some of their highest-valued items.

Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
