Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  21  90  13  59  77  86  26
1  89  48  40  62  80  69  52  81
2  27   9  91  20  87  14  19  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use an approach that considers maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Let's analyze the situation and find a suitable allocation.

We have 8 items and 3 agents. Each agent values the items differently. The goal is to allocate all the items such that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible, ideally minimizing envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (90).
   - Item 6 also has a high value (86).
   - Item 5 has a decent value (77).

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 (89).
   - Item 4 is valuable (80).
   - Item 7 is also valuable (81).

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 2 (91), but it is already allocated to Agent 0, so let's look at others.
   - Item 4 is highly valued (87), but it's allocated to Agent 1, so let's find alternatives.
   - Item 0 has a decent value (27).
   - Item 3 has a value (20).
   - Items 1 and 7 are available but have low values for Agent 2.

Given this analysis, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [2, 6, 5]
- **Agent 1** gets items: [0, 4, 7]
- **Agent 2** gets items: [1, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value reasonably, with an attempt to balance overall satisfaction. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
