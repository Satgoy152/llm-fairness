Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  44  64   6  64  65  95  43
1  13  23  94  28  84  96  65  53
2  32  65  97  11  72  63  27  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll use the valuations provided to guide the allocation, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their share.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 places high value on items 6 (95) and 5 (65).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (96) the most, followed by item 2 (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 (97) the most, followed by item 1 (65).

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items based on the highest preference of each agent, ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.
   - Attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives to enhance perceived fairness.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it has their highest valuation.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, since it is their highest preference and Agent 0's second-highest.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest preference and Agent 1's second-highest.
   - Distribute remaining items to balance total valuations.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Calculate remaining allocations based on the balance of each agent's total valuations, while considering their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6, which are among their higher-valued items.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 5, and 7, with item 5 being their top choice.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 4, including item 2, which is their highest valued item.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for each agent while respecting their preferences.
