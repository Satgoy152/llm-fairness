Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  49  77  63  34  81  33  44
1  93  92  11  98  42  50   9  87
2  22  45  31  62  20  30  82  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 92 11 98 42 50  9 87]
 [22 45 31 62 20 30 82 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. We'll approach this by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and trying to minimize envy.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  49  77  63  34  81  33  44
1  93  92  11  98  42  50   9  87
2  22  45  31  62  20  30  82  26
```

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 5 (81), 2 (77), 3 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 3 (98), 0 (93), 1 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 6 (82), 3 (62), 1 (45).

Starting with the highest valued items for each agent:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Next, continue to assign items to balance the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (second highest for Agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (second highest for Agent 1).
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (second highest for Agent 2).

With the remaining items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (as it maximizes Agent 0's value given remaining choices).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (as it maximizes Agent 1's value given remaining choices).

This gives us the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's preferences while keeping the total allocations to exactly 8 items.
