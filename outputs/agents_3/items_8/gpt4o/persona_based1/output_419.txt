Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  70  39  43  72  13  14  56
1  72  66   7  81  60  73  85  96
2  25  43  31  96  93  75   5  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 70 39 43 72 13 14 56]
 [72 66  7 81 60 73 85 96]
 [25 43 31 96 93 75  5 25]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to keep the allocation envy-free and efficient, considering the agents' valuations. The total number of items is 8, and each item must be allocated to one of the agents. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:  
   - Highest values are for items 0 (93), 4 (72), and 1 (70).
   
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:  
   - Highest values are for items 7 (96), 3 (81), and 6 (85).
   
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:  
   - Highest values are for items 3 (96), 4 (93), and 5 (75).

Let's consider a strategy to maximize valuations and ensure fairness:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the most valuable for them.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it is the most valuable for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is the most valuable for them.
- Next, assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by them.
- Finally, assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the remaining item and still provides value to them.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the total items are efficiently distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
