Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  81  83  17  59  35  61  48
1  22  58  97  65  91  14   2  20
2  19  19  65  59  71   6  93  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. This means each agent should feel satisfied with their own allocation relative to the others based on their valuations.

Let's assess the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy:

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0:** 81, 81, 83, 17, 59, 35, 61, 48
- **Agent 1:** 22, 58, 97, 65, 91, 14, 2, 20
- **Agent 2:** 19, 19, 65, 59, 71, 6, 93, 94

### Strategy:
To allocate the items fairly, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction and reduce envy. We'll start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent that maximizes their satisfaction.

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (value 83).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (value 97), but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we look at their next highest, item 4 (value 91).
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most (value 94).

Allocate these items first to each agent:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [7]

### Remaining Items and Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 81, 81, 17, 59, 35, 61, 48
- **Agent 1:** 22, 58, 65, 14, 2, 20
- **Agent 2:** 19, 19, 65, 59, 71, 6, 93

### Next Best Allocations:
- **Agent 0:** Highest remaining is item 0 or 1 (value 81).
- **Agent 1:** Highest remaining is item 3 (value 65).
- **Agent 2:** Highest remaining is item 6 (value 93).

Allocate these items:

- Agent 0: [2, 0]
- Agent 1: [4, 3]
- Agent 2: [7, 6]

### Remaining Items:
- **Agent 0:** 81, 17, 59, 35, 61, 48
- **Agent 1:** 22, 58, 14, 2, 20
- **Agent 2:** 19, 19, 65, 59, 71, 6

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Highest remaining is item 1 (value 81).
- **Agent 1:** Highest remaining is item 5 (value 14).
- **Agent 2:** Highest remaining is item 6 but taken; next is item 4 (value 71).

Allocate these items:

- Agent 0: [2, 0, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [7, 6]

All items are now allocated, and each agent receives a reasonable share considering their valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3, 5],
    "2": [7, 6]
}
```
