Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  52  89  35  40  67  41   9
1  86  39  48  66  87  37  82  50
2  77  91  53  95  59  11  10  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation and minimize envy among the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim for an allocation that balances the perceived value each agent receives. This problem can typically be addressed using methods like the adjusted winner procedure or by maximizing the Nash welfare. However, given the constraints and the need for an integer allocation, we can approach this problem heuristically:

1. **Initial Observation**: Each agent has different valuations for the items, and we need to ensure that each one feels they have received a fair share in terms of their own valuation.

2. **Strategy**: Start by assigning the items to the agents who value them the most, then adjust as needed to ensure that the distribution is fair and envy-free.

3. **Allocation Steps**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 6.
   - Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 3.

4. **Adjusting for Fairness**:
   - Ensure each agent gets close to an equal total valuation, taking into account their personal valuations of the items.

Following this reasoning:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate remaining items 5 and 7 to Agent 0 and Agent 2 respectively, aiming for balance in perceived valuation.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
