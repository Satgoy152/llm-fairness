Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  52  66  65  98  31  30  63
1  71  20  72  61  39  64  79  50
2  15  13  53  14  15  14  80  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the value each agent places on the items. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their total maximum value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent can get if they receive their most valued items:

- Agent 0: 98 (item 4) + 66 (item 2) + 65 (item 3) + 63 (item 7) + 52 (item 1) + 31 (item 5) + 30 (item 6) + 17 (item 0) = 422
- Agent 1: 79 (item 6) + 72 (item 2) + 71 (item 0) + 64 (item 5) + 61 (item 3) + 50 (item 7) + 39 (item 4) + 20 (item 1) = 456
- Agent 2: 94 (item 7) + 80 (item 6) + 53 (item 2) + 15 (item 4) + 14 (item 5) + 14 (item 3) + 13 (item 1) + 15 (item 0) = 298

Given these values, we try to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction while maintaining balance.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign the most valued items to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (98), Item 2 (66)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (79), Item 0 (71)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (94)

2. Assign the remaining items by considering the next most valued items:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (65), Item 1 (52)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (64)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (53) is already assigned to Agent 0, so no new item assignment here.

3. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: [4, 2, 3, 1]
   - Agent 1: [6, 0, 5]
   - Agent 2: [7]

Now let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 3, 1],
    "1": [6, 0, 5],
    "2": [7]
}
```
