Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  71  61  18  43  63  18  10
1  62  50  18  25  69  62  81  43
2  47  37  38  14  48  24  42  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 50 18 25 69 62 81 43]
 [47 37 38 14 48 24 42 77]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their perceived fair share. One common approach is to use the *Envy-Free* principle, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [57, 71, 61, 18, 43, 63, 18, 10]
- Agent 1: [62, 50, 18, 25, 69, 62, 81, 43]
- Agent 2: [47, 37, 38, 14, 48, 24, 42, 77]

The total value each agent perceives for all items is:

- Agent 0: 341
- Agent 1: 410
- Agent 2: 327

The ideal fair division would be to allocate items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is roughly proportional to their total valuation share. However, given the constraint of integer item allocations, we need to consider specific allocations.

A potential allocation strategy is:

1. Assign items with the highest value to each agent, ensuring no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.
2. Balance the remaining items to maintain relatively equal perceived value among agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items while balancing valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (57), 1 (71), 5 (63)
- Agent 1: Items 4 (69), 6 (81)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (38), 3 (14), 7 (77)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 57 + 71 + 63 = 191
- Agent 1: 69 + 81 = 150
- Agent 2: 38 + 14 + 77 = 129

This distribution attempts to respect individual preferences while ensuring a balanced distribution of total perceived value. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
