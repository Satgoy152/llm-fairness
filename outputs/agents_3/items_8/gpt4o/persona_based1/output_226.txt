Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  19  58  11  43  56   0  32
1  69  87  24  71  43  43  21  32
2  14  84  95  72  72  10  86  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 6 + 19 + 58 + 11 + 43 + 56 + 0 + 32 = 225
   - Agent 1: 69 + 87 + 24 + 71 + 43 + 43 + 21 + 32 = 390
   - Agent 2: 14 + 84 + 95 + 72 + 72 + 10 + 86 + 48 = 481

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   
   We can start by allocating items that each agent highly values, ensuring that we balance the total value derived by each agent.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - **Agent 0:** High value items: 2 (58), 5 (56)
   - **Agent 1:** High value items: 1 (87), 3 (71)
   - **Agent 2:** High value items: 2 (95), 6 (86)

4. **Adjust to Ensure All Items are Allocated:**

   - Remaining items to allocate: 0, 4, 7
   - **Agent 0** can take item 0 (6) and item 7 (32)
   - **Agent 2** can take item 4 (72)

5. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3
   - Agent 2: Items 4, 6

This allocation seeks to optimize each agent's value by emphasizing items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.

{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
