Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87   1  76  26  78  31  68  70
1  53   8  92   4  35  72  95  71
2  82  88  80  71  47  97  15  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the Round Robin or the Adjusted Winner procedure. In this scenario, I'll use a simplified approach to achieve a balanced distribution based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:**
   - Agent 0: 87 + 1 + 76 + 26 + 78 + 31 + 68 + 70 = 437
   - Agent 1: 53 + 8 + 92 + 4 + 35 + 72 + 95 + 71 = 430
   - Agent 2: 82 + 88 + 80 + 71 + 47 + 97 + 15 + 47 = 527

2. **Allocate items such that each agent maximizes their total valuation while also considering the preferences of other agents:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Assign items: 0, 6 (maximizes the higher valuations for agent 0)

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Assign items: 2, 5, 7 (maximizes the higher valuations for agent 1)

   - **Agent 2:**
     - Assign items: 1, 3, 4 (maximizes the higher valuations for agent 2)

3. **Check allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 6] = 87 + 68 = 155
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 5, 7] = 92 + 72 + 71 = 235
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 4] = 88 + 71 + 47 = 206

This allocation ensures that the total number of items is 8 and that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
