Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  22   6  95  60  74  87  48
1  39  54  16  38  69  92  89  17
2  89  75  56  91  90  32  17  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 3 agents (0, 1, 2) and 8 items (0 to 7).
   - The goal is to distribute 8 items among the 3 agents.

2. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to get an idea of their preferences.
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 437
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 414
   - Agent 2's total valuation: 502

3. **Fair Share Calculation:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive a fair share that is proportional to their total valuation.
   - Since there are 8 items, each agent should get approximately 8/3 ≈ 2.67 items.
   - However, items are indivisible, so we target 2 or 3 items per agent.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items so that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

5. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent to maximize their satisfaction.
   - Consider the remaining items and allocate to minimize envy.

After going through the above considerations, the allocations can be as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Items [3, 5, 7] (Total valuation = 95 + 74 + 48 = 217)
- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 6] (Total valuation = 69 + 89 = 158)
- **Agent 2:** Items [0, 1, 2] (Total valuation = 89 + 75 + 56 = 220)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let’s present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
