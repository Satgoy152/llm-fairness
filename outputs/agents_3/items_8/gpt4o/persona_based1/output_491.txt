Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25   7  32  11  48  83  67  10
1  50  35  24  37  37   9   8  76
2  51  24  46  49  51  82  14  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that tries to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share. A common method for achieving this is the "Envy-Free" allocation. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

### Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value Per Agent**: Compute the total value each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items**: Start by assigning high-value items to agents who value them the most.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items, aiming to balance total value across agents.

### Calculating Total Valuations:

- Agent 0: 25 + 7 + 32 + 11 + 48 + 83 + 67 + 10 = 283
- Agent 1: 50 + 35 + 24 + 37 + 37 + 9 + 8 + 76 = 276
- Agent 2: 51 + 24 + 46 + 49 + 51 + 82 + 14 + 22 = 339

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Assign items based on maximum value preference.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least 2 items (since there are 8 items and 3 agents).

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5 (83 value), 6 (67 value)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (50 value), 7 (76 value)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 (46 value), 3 (49 value), 4 (51 value), 1 (24 value)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations and minimizes envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be envy-free as much as possible, given the constraints, and ensures that all items are allocated to the agents.
