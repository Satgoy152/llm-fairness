Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6   9  16  78  29  53  67  73
1  55   7  82  21  17  85  20  38
2  51  10  89  84  70  79  99  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [51 10 89 84 70 79 99 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly. Given the valuation matrix, we need to allocate all 8 items among the 3 agents.

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) that each agent receives.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 3, 7, and 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 5 significantly more than others.
- Agent 2 values items 6, 2, and 5 highly.

A possible fair allocation that maximizes utility for each agent could be:

1. Allocate items primarily based on the highest valuations:
   - Give item 5 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation.
   - Give item 2 and item 6 to Agent 2, as they value item 6 the most and item 2 highly.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.

2. Distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest preferences and ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share:
   - Item 7 to Agent 0, since they value it highly.
   - Item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.
   - Item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.
   - Item 4 to Agent 2 as a supplementary item.

This results in each agent having a bundle of items they value significantly.

Here's the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
