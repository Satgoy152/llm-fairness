Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14   1  19  86  44  94  84  82
1  24  47  84  31  26  34  63  75
2  24  71  54  64  63  67  51  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, I will use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents and trying to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation. A simple approach is to use the method of "round-robin" allocation based on each agent's highest value item that hasn't been assigned yet. Let's go through this process:

1. **Initialize**: Create an empty allocation for each agent.
2. **Round-Robin Assignment**: Iteratively assign each agent their highest value item that hasn't been assigned yet, until all items are allocated.

Using this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest value item: Item 5 (value 94)
  - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value 86)
  - Next highest value item: Item 6 (value 84)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 84)
  - Next highest value item: Item 7 (value 75)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 71)
  - Next highest value item: Item 4 (value 63)
  - Next highest value item: Item 0 (value 24)

Therefore, based on this allocation strategy, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives the items that they value the most given the constraints.
