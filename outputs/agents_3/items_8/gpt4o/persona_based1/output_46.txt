Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  62  93  95  37  28  95  86
1  31  25  11  39  52  87  28  16
2   9  21  57  70  73  46  25  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0: 49 + 62 + 93 + 95 + 37 + 28 + 95 + 86 = 545
   - Agent 1: 31 + 25 + 11 + 39 + 52 + 87 + 28 + 16 = 289
   - Agent 2: 9 + 21 + 57 + 70 + 73 + 46 + 25 + 43 = 344

2. **Determine the proportion of total value each agent contributes:**
   - Total value = 545 + 289 + 344 = 1178
   - Proportion for Agent 0 = 545 / 1178 ≈ 0.4625
   - Proportion for Agent 1 = 289 / 1178 ≈ 0.2453
   - Proportion for Agent 2 = 344 / 1178 ≈ 0.2922

3. **Allocate items to agents based on their valuations and proportions:**
   - Since there are 8 items, ideally, we should aim to allocate roughly:
     - 0.4625 * 8 ≈ 3.7 items to Agent 0
     - 0.2453 * 8 ≈ 2.0 items to Agent 1
     - 0.2922 * 8 ≈ 2.3 items to Agent 2

4. **Item Allocation:**
   - Allocate the highest valued items to each agent according to their valuations, ensuring that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

   - **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3, 6, 2, 7. Assign items 3, 6, and 2.
   - **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 5, 4, 3, 1. Assign items 5 and 4.
   - **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 4, 3, 2, 7. Assign items 7, 1, and 0.

5. **Check for envy-freeness:**
   - Ensure no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given this, here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [7, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation respects the agents' preferences and attempts to balance the distribution based on their valuations.
