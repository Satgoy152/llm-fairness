Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  62  56  60  30  35  43   1
1  72  87  66  47  20  69  74  82
2  77  64  39  70  55  11  91  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while taking into account their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness as a guiding principle. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

In this scenario, we aim to allocate all 8 items among the 3 agents. Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Look for high-valued items for each agent** to start with a base allocation that might lead to envy-freeness. 
2. **Prioritize items** where an agent has a significantly higher valuation compared to others.
3. **Iterate through allocations** to ensure every agent feels they have a fair share.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0:
  - High valuation on item 2 (56) compared to others.
  - Also has significant valuations for items 3 (60) and 6 (43).
  
- Agent 1:
  - High valuations on item 1 (87) and item 7 (82).
  - Good valuation on item 5 (69).

- Agent 2:
  - High valuation on item 6 (91), so it should go to Agent 2.
  - Also values item 0 (77) and item 3 (70) highly.

Based on the above observations, we can try to allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 3] (Values: 56, 60)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 7, 5] (Values: 87, 82, 69)
- **Agent 2**: Items [6, 0, 4] (Values: 91, 77, 55)

Let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent ends up with a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 7, 5],
    "2": [6, 0, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items with values 56 and 60.
- Agent 1 gets items with values 87, 82, and 69.
- Agent 2 receives items with values 91, 77, and 55.

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a manner that respects the high-value preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
