Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  95  84  20  69  28   5  70
1  64  73  13  81  58  52  28  91
2  92   3  43  17  63  84  55  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations and the need to allocate exactly 8 items, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the values:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** 2, 95, 84, 20, 69, 28, 5, 70
- **Agent 1's valuations:** 64, 73, 13, 81, 58, 52, 28, 91
- **Agent 2's valuations:** 92, 3, 43, 17, 63, 84, 55, 96

The goal is to assign items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

### Proposed Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0: Items 1 (95) and 2 (84)
   - Assign these high-value items: [1, 2]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1: Items 7 (91) and 3 (81)
   - Assign these high-value items: [7, 3]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2: Items 7 (96), 0 (92), and 5 (84)
   - Assign these high-value items: [0, 5, 6]

### Allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [3, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 5, 6]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
