Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  47   1  16   8  71  73  21
1  90  89  49  41  20  39  87   5
2   6  78  51  12  72  42  49  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to iteratively assign items to agents based on their preferences until all items are allocated, while trying to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation considering the given valuations:

1. **Assign the highest valued items:** Start by assigning the items with the highest individual valuations to the respective agents. This ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 73.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 90.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 the highest at 95.

2. **Continue assigning items based on decreasing order of value for each agent:**
   - After the initial allocation, continue assigning the remaining items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

3. **Check for envy-freeness:** Adjust the allocation if necessary to minimize envy among agents.

Following this method, let's perform the allocations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest valued item is 6 (73), assign item 6.
  - Next, assign item 1 (47), item 5 (71).

- Agent 1:
  - Highest valued item is 0 (90), assign item 0.
  - Next, assign item 2 (49), item 4 (20).

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valued item is 7 (95), assign item 7.
  - Next, assign item 3 (12).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and that each agent receives items that they value highly, aiming to achieve a fair division.
