Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  71  55  37  97  46  35  14
1  28  67  75  74  85  22  32  87
2  60  62  98  63  92  87   3   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the fair division and envy-freeness problem, we need to allocate the items to agents in a manner that minimizes envy and ensures fairness. One common approach to achieve this is the Envy-Free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own.

To start, we need to look at the valuations and try to allocate items such that the agents are as satisfied as possible given their preferences.

Here is the valuation table:

```
    Item
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  71  55  37  97  46  35  14
1  28  67  75  74  85  22  32  87
2  60  62  98  63  92  87   3   9
```

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 2:** We start with agent 2, who has the highest valuation for item 2 (98) and item 5 (87). We assign these items to agent 2.

2. **Agent 0:** Next, we consider agent 0. The highest remaining valuation for agent 0 is item 4 (97). We assign item 4 to agent 0.

3. **Agent 1:** Agent 1's highest remaining valuation is item 7 (87). We assign item 7 to agent 1.

4. **Remaining Items:** The remaining items are 0, 1, 3, and 6. We allocate these to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets at least some items.

   - **Agent 0**: The next highest valuation for agent 0 is item 1 (71). We assign item 1 to agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: The next highest valuation for agent 1 is item 3 (74). We assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - **Agent 0**: The next highest valuation for agent 0 is item 0 (15). We assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - **Agent 2**: The remaining item is 6 (valued at 3 by agent 2). We assign item 6 to agent 2.

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items [4, 1, 0].
- Agent 1 receives items [7, 3].
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 5, 6].

This allocation aims to respect the preferences of the agents and distribute the items fairly.

**JSON format allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 0],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
