Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  70   8  61  59  83  10  16
1  36  78   8  24  50  78  41  95
2  57   3  15  60  38  66  63  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36 78  8 24 50 78 41 95]
 [57  3 15 60 38 66 63 13]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to distribute the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations provided, we can attempt to allocate items by considering each agent's preferences and the total value they receive. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items allocated: 1, 4, 7
   - Total value: 70 + 59 + 16 = 145

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items allocated: 0, 5, 6
   - Total value: 36 + 78 + 41 = 155

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items allocated: 2, 3
   - Total value: 15 + 60 = 75

This allocation considers the highest preferences for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations. The distribution is subject to further evaluation to ensure minimal envy, but this serves as a balanced starting point.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
