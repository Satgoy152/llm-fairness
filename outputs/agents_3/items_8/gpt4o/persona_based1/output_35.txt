Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  48  20  15  68  81   9  46
1   4   5   4   5  19  44  63  18
2  58  29  67   8  69  39   0  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into account their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free division. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given the valuations.

Let's try to achieve a fair allocation by using a simple heuristic approach:

1. **Initial Allocation**: We will start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, which is a straightforward way to minimize envy.

2. **Adjustments**: We will then adjust the allocation if needed to ensure each agent gets a fair share, considering both the number of items and the total value.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (70). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (48). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (67). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (5). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (69). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (63). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (46). Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

### Initial Allocation Summary:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 70 + 48 + 81 + 46 = 245
- Agent 1: 5 + 63 = 68
- Agent 2: 67 + 69 = 136

This division is not envy-free as Agent 1 might envy others. Let's make adjustments for a more balanced outcome:

- Move item 7 from Agent 0 to Agent 1. This gives:
  - Agent 0: [0, 1, 5]
  - Agent 1: [3, 6, 7]
  - Agent 2: [2, 4]

Recalculate the values:
- Agent 0: 70 + 48 + 81 = 199
- Agent 1: 5 + 63 + 46 = 114
- Agent 2: 67 + 69 = 136

This allocation is more balanced and reduces potential envy. Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
