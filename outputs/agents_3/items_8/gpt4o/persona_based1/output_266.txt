Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  51  90  29  71  87  81  33
1  70  98   4  78  70  64  37  79
2  69  53  35  72  44  36  37  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility while also considering envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation, given that they each must receive an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 46 + 51 + 90 + 29 + 71 + 87 + 81 + 33 = 488
- Agent 1's total valuation: 70 + 98 + 4 + 78 + 70 + 64 + 37 + 79 = 500
- Agent 2's total valuation: 69 + 53 + 35 + 72 + 44 + 36 + 37 + 42 = 388

One approach is to use a round-robin method based on the agents' preferences to allocate the items. This ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, potentially reducing envy.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can prioritize giving each agent the items they value most highly:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 2, 5, 6, and 4.
2. Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 1, 3, 7, and 0.
3. Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 0, 3, 1, and 4.

Starting with the highest-valued items for each agent, we allocate items one by one, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once and each agent receives a fair share.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation seeks to provide each agent with items they value highly and ensures every item is allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
