Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  78  62  96  77  15  81  63
1  18  58  80  88  54  96  35  98
2  78  65  78   7  74  83  25  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78 65 78  7 74 83 25 77]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible to envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent places on the items.

Here's a step-by-step procedure to ensure a relatively fair distribution:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Review the valuations of each agent for each item.
2. **Highest Value Allocation**: Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.
3. **Balancing the Allocation**: Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Preferences are highest for items: 3 (96), 6 (81)
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Preferences are highest for items: 5 (96), 7 (98)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Preferences are highest for items: 0 (78), 2 (78), 5 (83), 7 (77)

Let's allocate these items ensuring each agent receives at least two items and considering fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 3, 6
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 5, 7
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0, 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4:

- **For Agent 0**: Item 1 (78)
- **For Agent 1**: Item 4 (54)

This gives each agent a total of three items, which is fair given there are 8 items and 3 agents.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 1],
    "1": [5, 7, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

All items have been allocated, and each agent has a reasonable share according to their preferences.
