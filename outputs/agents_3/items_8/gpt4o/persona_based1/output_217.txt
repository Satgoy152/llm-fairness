Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   8  53  16  75  86  99  13
1  72  36  54  88  32  25   8  62
2   5  16  40  95  53  94  92  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. We'll use an approach that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **List the agent valuations for each item**:
   - Agent 0: [99, 8, 53, 16, 75, 86, 99, 13]
   - Agent 1: [72, 36, 54, 88, 32, 25, 8, 62]
   - Agent 2: [5, 16, 40, 95, 53, 94, 92, 44]

2. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Total for Agent 0: 449
   - Total for Agent 1: 377
   - Total for Agent 2: 439

3. **Fair share calculation** (ideal target value):
   - Fair share for each agent = Total value / 3.
   - Agent 0: 449 / 3 ≈ 149.67
   - Agent 1: 377 / 3 ≈ 125.67
   - Agent 2: 439 / 3 ≈ 146.33

4. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's value without exceeding their fair share too much**:
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most, while balancing the allocation to ensure each agent gets approximately their fair share.

5. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [3, 7]
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 5]

Following this approach, we attempt to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, resulting in a fair distribution.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
