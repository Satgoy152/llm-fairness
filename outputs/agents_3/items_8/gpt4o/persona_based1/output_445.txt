Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  86   5   8  49  74  48  71
1  12  42  20  72  56  39  29  39
2   2  85  46  15  95  81  67  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that each agent does not envy another agent when considering the value of all items except possibly one.

Here's one possible allocation that aims to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0 and 1. Assigning these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 3. Assigning item 3 to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 4. Assigning item 4 to Agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 might benefit from an additional item that they value moderately, such as item 5.
- Agent 1 could get items 7 and 6, as they have moderate values for these items.
- Agent 2 could get item 2, as they have a relatively higher value for it compared to the other agents.

After considering individual valuations and aiming to balance the allocations, the following allocation is proposed:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7, 6],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a significant portion of their most valued items while aiming to maintain fairness across the board.
