Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  10  91  93  29  80  30  71
1  59  98  85  84  47  57   6  12
2  81  75  42  79  93  13   0  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

To proceed, we need to consider how to distribute the items based on the valuations given by each agent while ensuring that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 2 to 3 items.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest value items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives approximately the same number of items (in this case, 2 or 3 items each).
3. Check and adjust allocations to reduce potential envy.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most and has relatively high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most and also has high valuations for items 0 and 7.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0: Items 2 and 5.
2. Agent 1: Items 1 and 3.
3. Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 6, and 7.

This allocation gives each agent a set of items they highly value, balancing the distribution of items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least two items, with Agent 2 receiving four items due to their relatively high valuations across these items.
