Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  20  29  94  36  76  46  82
1  68  20  87  70  97  11  58  80
2  75  61  46  96  20  44  75  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 20 87 70 97 11 58 80]
 [75 61 46 96 20 44 75 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, or at least an allocation that maximizes fairness given the constraints. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated.

Given the valuations of the items by each of the three agents, we can proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 96). Agent 2 picks item 3.
2. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for item 7 (value 98). Agent 2 picks item 7.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 97). Agent 1 picks item 4.
4. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 2 (value 87). Agent 1 picks item 2.
5. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 76). Agent 0 picks item 5.
6. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 6 (value 46). Agent 0 picks item 6.
7. **Agent 0** picks item 0 (value 50) as it's their highest remaining valued item.
8. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 20).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations and respects their preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 7]
}
```
