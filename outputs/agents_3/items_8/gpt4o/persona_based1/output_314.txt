Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  34  41   4  11  72  97  12
1  57  80  38  66  30  69   6  66
2   2  36  64  87  70  98  26  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use principles from fair division theory. One common approach is to try and achieve an allocation that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Here, we aim to allocate 8 items among 3 agents based on their valuations, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

First, let's analyze the valuations to determine an allocation that aims to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values the items as follows: [12, 34, 41, 4, 11, 72, 97, 12].
2. **Agent 1** values the items as follows: [57, 80, 38, 66, 30, 69, 6, 66].
3. **Agent 2** values the items as follows: [2, 36, 64, 87, 70, 98, 26, 35].

We will try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's perceived value, while also aiming for an allocation that is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0** has a strong preference for item 6 (value 97) and item 5 (value 72). Assign these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (value 80) and item 3 (value 66), as well as item 0 (value 57). Assign these to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 5 (value 98), but since it's already assigned to Agent 0, we prioritize item 3 (value 87) and item 4 (value 70) for Agent 2.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4

We still need to allocate items 2 and 7:

- For item 2, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (value 64), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- For item 7, Agent 1 values it equally with Agent 2 (value 66 and 35, respectively), but Agent 1 has a higher absolute value. Therefore, allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: [5, 6]
2. **Agent 1**: [0, 1, 3, 7]
3. **Agent 2**: [2, 4]

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, minimizing envy to the extent possible given the discrete nature of the allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
