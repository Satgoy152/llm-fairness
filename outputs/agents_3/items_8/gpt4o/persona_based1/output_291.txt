Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  89  36  37  26  96  63  91
1  11  98  74  86  29  64  52  93
2  24  75  93  25  12  93  98  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the integer constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible items is not always possible, but we can aim to minimize envy.

Let's follow these general steps:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine the total value each agent places on all items. This helps to understand their preferences in general.
   
2. **Sort Items by Value for Each Agent**: For each agent, sort the items based on their valuations. This helps identify which items are most valuable to each agent.
   
3. **Initial Allocation**: Start allocating the most valued items to each agent one by one, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and balancing the total number of items allocated.
   
4. **Adjust for Fairness**: Review the allocation to see if any swaps can reduce envy, ensuring each agent gets a fair share relative to their valuations.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [21, 89, 36, 37, 26, 96, 63, 91]
   - Total Value: 459

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [11, 98, 74, 86, 29, 64, 52, 93]
   - Total Value: 507

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [24, 75, 93, 25, 12, 93, 98, 14]
   - Total Value: 434

**Sorted Preferences:**

- Agent 0: [5 (96), 7 (91), 1 (89), 6 (63), 2 (36), 3 (37), 4 (26), 0 (21)]
- Agent 1: [1 (98), 7 (93), 3 (86), 2 (74), 5 (64), 6 (52), 4 (29), 0 (11)]
- Agent 2: [6 (98), 2 (93), 5 (93), 1 (75), 0 (24), 3 (25), 7 (14), 4 (12)]

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Allocate items starting with the highest value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets around the same number of items. Try to balance the total value received by each agent.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 7, which are their highest value items.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4, which are among their top preferences.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, and 6, which are high-value items for them.

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items while considering each agent's preferences to minimize envy.
