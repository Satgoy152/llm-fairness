Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  23  64  81   1   7  65   3
1  45  85  92  23  50  92  60  81
2  20  87  61  14  82  39  35  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent feels they are receiving a fair bundle of items. A common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations in the table, let's try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 3 (81) and 6 (65).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 2 (92) and 5 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 1 (87) and 4 (82).

Let's start the allocation process:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 3 and 6, as these are the highest valued by agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 5, as these are the highest valued by agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1 and 4, as these are the highest valued by agent 2.

Now we have remaining items: 0 and 7.

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (27) as it has the highest remaining value for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (81), as it is the next highest valued item for this agent.

Now, each agent has been assigned items in a manner where they have a fair share based on their preferences.

The allocations can be given as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent has a bundle that reflects a fair allocation of the available items based on their valuations.
