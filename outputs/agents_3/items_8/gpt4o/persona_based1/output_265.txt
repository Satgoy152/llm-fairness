Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  81  48  91  42  99   7  13
1  78  81  99  30  66  90  44   2
2  30  79  91  33  10  82   7  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 81 99 30 66 90 44  2]
 [30 79 91 33 10 82  7 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to one as possible. This involves assigning items such that no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent, given their respective valuations.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(56 + 81 + 48 + 91 + 42 + 99 + 7 + 13 = 437\)
- Agent 1: \(78 + 81 + 99 + 30 + 66 + 90 + 44 + 2 = 490\)
- Agent 2: \(30 + 79 + 91 + 33 + 10 + 82 + 7 + 95 = 427\)

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's share is as close as possible to one-third of the total valuation.

Now let's go through a potential allocation process:

1. **Assign items to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values items 3 and 5 very highly (91 and 99 respectively), which should be prioritized.
   - Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign items to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values items 2 and 5 the highest, but item 5 is already assigned. The next highest values are for items 0 and 1 (78 and 81).
   - Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign items to Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (95), so it should be prioritized.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Re-evaluate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 1, 4, and 6.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (81) highly.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (66) and item 6 (44) higher than Agent 2.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 and item 6 to Agent 1.

Now let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their value based on their preferences, while keeping the distribution as fair as possible.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6],
    "2": [7]
}
```
