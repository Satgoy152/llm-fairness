Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  74  95   2  25  16  70  33
1   7  57  31  53  98  71  43  86
2  40  65  64  25  84  61  37  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an algorithmic approach like the "round-robin" method or a "maximum marginal gain" method. Here's a possible allocation using a heuristic approach to minimize envy and fairly distribute the items:

### Step-by-step allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valued items: 2 (95), 1 (74), 6 (70)
    - Allocate items 2, 1, 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest valued items: 4 (98), 7 (86)
    - Allocate items 4, 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest valued items: 1 (65), 4 (84), 5 (61)
    - Item 1 is already allocated, so allocate items 5, 0 (50) to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining items**:
    - Item 3: Consider each agentâ€™s valuation:
        - Agent 0: 2
        - Agent 1: 53
        - Agent 2: 25
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation among the remaining).

5. **Re-evaluate**:
    - All items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.

### Final Allocation:

The final allocation based on the above steps is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 3],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations per agent while attempting to distribute the items fairly among them.
