Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  58  74  57   9  61  72  79
1  31  74  86  92  82   5  38  52
2  86  36  66  29   6  44  94   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. This is a combinatorial problem that can be approached using various methods such as the Envy-Free Matching or the Adjusted Winner Procedure. However, given the constraints and the number of items and agents, we can attempt a manual allocation that seems balanced.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 50 + 58 + 74 + 57 + 9 + 61 + 72 + 79 = 460
- Agent 1's total valuation: 31 + 74 + 86 + 92 + 82 + 5 + 38 + 52 = 460
- Agent 2's total valuation: 86 + 36 + 66 + 29 + 6 + 44 + 94 + 0 = 361

Next, we aim to allocate items such that each agent's share is approximately proportional to their total valuation. This is a heuristic approach to ensure fairness.

Step 1: Allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most.

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it most (86).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it most (74).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it most (86).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it most (92).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it most (82).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it most (61).
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it most (94).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it most (79).

This initial allocation leaves Agent 1 with more items, so let's adjust to balance the item count:

- Agent 1 has 4 items (1, 2, 3, 4), Agent 0 has 2 items (5, 7), Agent 2 has 2 items (0, 6).

Given that Agent 1 has a strong preference for the items they received, let's reallocate one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0:

Reallocation:

- Swap item 3 (Agent 1, value 92) with item 1 (Agent 0, value 58).

Now the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: 1, 5, 7
- Agent 1: 2, 3, 4
- Agent 2: 0, 6

Valuations after reallocation:

- Agent 0's allocation: Items 1 (58), 5 (61), 7 (79) = 198
- Agent 1's allocation: Items 2 (86), 3 (92), 4 (82) = 260
- Agent 2's allocation: Items 0 (86), 6 (94) = 180

This allocation maintains a balance while considering each agent's preferences. The items are split fairly according to their valuations, with adjustments to ensure all items are allocated.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
