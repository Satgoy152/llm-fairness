Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  58   4  77   8  48   4   3
1  18   9  67  85  83  31  95  93
2  53  81  91  42  17  25  89  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 81 91 42 17 25 89 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences. One approach to achieve this is to use the Envy-Free allocation method, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [34, 58, 4, 77, 8, 48, 4, 3]
Agent 1: [18, 9, 67, 85, 83, 31, 95, 93]
Agent 2: [53, 81, 91, 42, 17, 25, 89, 30]
```

We need to consider each agent's valuation to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [3, 5]
   - They value item 3 highly (77) and item 5 (48) compared to other items.
2. **Agent 1**: Items [2, 4, 6]
   - They value items 2 (67), 4 (83), and 6 (95) highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1, 7]
   - They value items 0 (53), 1 (81), and 7 (30) highly.

This allocation tries to assign items based on each agent's preferences while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8. Each agent has a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```
