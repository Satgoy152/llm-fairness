Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  13  29  19  49  55   3  32
1  48  69  50   9  93  81  38  35
2  78  15  57  37  10  22   3  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that seeks envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll employ a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives approximately the same number of items, given there are 8 items and 3 agents.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 246
- Agent 1 total value: 423
- Agent 2 total value: 297

First, we calculate the average number of items each agent should get, which is \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \). This means two agents can get 3 items each, and one agent will get 2 items.

Let's try to allocate the items such that we maximize each agent's total valuation, while also ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.

1. **Agent 1** (highest total valuation) should receive the items they value the most, given they have the highest potential for envy:

   - Items: 4 (value 93), 5 (value 81), 1 (value 69)

2. **Agent 2** can receive the next highest valued items they prefer:

   - Items: 0 (value 78), 7 (value 75), 2 (value 57)

3. **Agent 0** will get the remaining items:

   - Items: 3 (value 19), 6 (value 3)

These allocations are aimed at reducing the potential for envy. Each agent gets their most valued items from the remaining pool after satisfying the agent with the highest total valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 1],
    "2": [0, 7, 2]
}
```
