Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  42   5  31  52  25  70  62
1  39  62  72  70  97  61  43  77
2  26  87  33  41  55  61  66  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims for fairness and envy-freeness, we start by considering each agent's valuation of the items. We will use a method that tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction across agents, often referred to as the "maximin" approach, while considering envy-freeness.

We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value according to their assessments. The total value of all items according to each agent is:

- Agent 0: 93 + 42 + 5 + 31 + 52 + 25 + 70 + 62 = 380
- Agent 1: 39 + 62 + 72 + 70 + 97 + 61 + 43 + 77 = 521
- Agent 2: 26 + 87 + 33 + 41 + 55 + 61 + 66 + 85 = 454

Next, let's try to allocate items so that each agent gets items they value highly, while attempting to ensure that no agent envies another.

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive, but balancing the total value each agent receives to be as close as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items they value highly, such as item 0 (93), item 6 (70), and item 7 (62).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items like item 4 (97), item 2 (72), and item 7 (77).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items such as item 1 (87), item 5 (61), and item 3 (41).

After testing various allocations, let's propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 6] 
- **Agent 1**: [4, 2, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 3, 7]

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent's preferences while ensuring that the distribution is envy-free as much as possible.

Finally, the allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
