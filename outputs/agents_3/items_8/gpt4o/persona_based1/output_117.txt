Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  69  91  60  28  72  24   8
1  25  90  68  55  90  35  57  62
2  78  31  15  67  87  48  66  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78 31 15 67 87 48 66 74]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (87).

2. **First Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items and Values:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
   - Evaluate remaining items for remaining allocation.

4. **Second Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has item 2, next highest value item is item 5 (72).
   - Agent 1 has item 1, next highest value item is item 0 (25).
   - Agent 2 has item 4, next highest value item is item 7 (74).

5. **Third Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Remaining highest value item 3 (60).
   - Agent 1: Remaining highest value item 6 (57).
   - Agent 2: Remaining highest value item 5 (48).

6. **Final Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 0, 6
   - Agent 2: Items 4, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an equal number of items (3), and the distribution is done considering their individual valuations to minimize envy.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 3],
    "1": [1, 0, 6],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```
