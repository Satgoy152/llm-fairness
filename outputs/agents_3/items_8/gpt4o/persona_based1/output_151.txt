Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  71  23  63  65  51  61  98
1  72  22  54  63  91  12  87  44
2  45  11  78  30  88  43  20  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 22 54 63 91 12 87 44]
 [45 11 78 30 88 43 20 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations to ensure the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(0 + 71 + 23 + 63 + 65 + 51 + 61 + 98 = 432\)
- Agent 1: \(72 + 22 + 54 + 63 + 91 + 12 + 87 + 44 = 445\)
- Agent 2: \(45 + 11 + 78 + 30 + 88 + 43 + 20 + 39 = 354\)

Now, let's make an initial attempt at an envy-free allocation by maximizing each agent's total value from their assigned items, balancing as needed to ensure fairness:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 7 (98), item 1 (71), and item 6 (61). Let's start by giving them items 7, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (91), and item 0 (72). Let's give them items 4 and 0.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (78), and item 4 (88) but since item 4 is already allocated, we'll give them item 2 and item 5.

Now, let's check the allocations and ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 0
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

Now we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 3 (63) for additional value.
- Agent 1 can take item 3, but since it's already given to Agent 0, we'll adjust.
- Agent 2 can take item 3 since it's the only one left unallocated.

Now we finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

With this allocation, each agent receives a fair number of items, and every item is allocated.
