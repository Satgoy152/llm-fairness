Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  85  42  95  99  21  30  43
1  74  25  55  46  83  36  36  70
2  74  38  72  97  36  85  19  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and tries to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Since we have 8 items and 3 agents, each agent will get approximately 2-3 items. 

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to achieve the most balanced distribution.

**Valuations Table:**

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 15      | 74      | 74      |
| 1    | 85      | 25      | 38      |
| 2    | 42      | 55      | 72      |
| 3    | 95      | 46      | 97      |
| 4    | 99      | 83      | 36      |
| 5    | 21      | 36      | 85      |
| 6    | 30      | 36      | 19      |
| 7    | 43      | 70      | 60      |

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them those items if possible.
2. Balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
  - Valuation for Agent 0: 85 + 99 = 184
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
  - Valuation for Agent 1: 74 + 70 = 144
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 5, 6
  - Valuation for Agent 2: 72 + 97 + 85 + 19 = 273

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they relatively value highly, while also distributing the items fairly among the agents.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
