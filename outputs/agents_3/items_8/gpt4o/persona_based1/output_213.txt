Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77   3  82  25  61  52  56   4
1  49  10  64  40  13  33  49   4
2  37  10  99  94  96  43  80  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 10 99 94 96 43 80 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be entirely possible, we will try to approximate it as closely as possible. Each agent should feel that they are not worse off compared to any other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the agents' preferences and valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: [77, 3, 82, 25, 61, 52, 56, 4]
- Agent 1 values items: [49, 10, 64, 40, 13, 33, 49, 4]
- Agent 2 values items: [37, 10, 99, 94, 96, 43, 80, 50]

Given these valuations, we will aim to allocate the items in a way that balances the overall satisfaction of each agent. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5, 7]
   - Valuation: 77 (item 0) + 52 (item 5) + 4 (item 7) = 133

2. **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3, 6]
   - Valuation: 10 (item 1) + 40 (item 3) + 49 (item 6) = 99

3. **Agent 2**: Items [2, 4]
   - Valuation: 99 (item 2) + 96 (item 4) = 195

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations each agent receives, ensuring each gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
