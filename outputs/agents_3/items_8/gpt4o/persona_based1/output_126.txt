Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  83  16  94  28  13  56  73
1  38  60  91  72  76  62  15  95
2  72  51  57  83  89  12  32  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that aims to minimize envy and ensure a balanced distribution of total value received by each agent. One common method is to use an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value the most within the constraints.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 0      | 83     | 16     | 94     | 28     | 13     | 56     | 73     |
| 1     | 38     | 60     | 91     | 72     | 76     | 62     | 15     | 95     |
| 2     | 72     | 51     | 57     | 83     | 89     | 12     | 32     | 87     |

We will proceed by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring a fair division.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by assigning items with the highest valuations for each agent. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (94), followed by item 1 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 7 (95), which is the highest valued by agent 1, followed by item 2 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (89), which is highly valued by agent 2, followed by item 0 (72).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it increases their overall valuation without giving them more than 3 items.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, giving them a total of 3 items.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, balancing the number of items each agent has and increasing their total valuation.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 7, 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 4, 0

The json allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [7, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 0, 1]
}
```
