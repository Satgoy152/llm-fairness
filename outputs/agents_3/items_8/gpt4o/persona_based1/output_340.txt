Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  41  97  72  59  80   8  38
1  41  88  45  60  67  57  26  22
2  24  17  77  42  77  56  87  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. This means that each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations and differing valuations, we will aim to approximate it by maximizing each agent's valuation of their allocation.

Let's begin by considering simple heuristics for fair division:

1. **Maximizing Total Value for Each Agent**: This involves assigning items to each agent based on the highest valuation they have for the items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

2. **Checking for Envy**: After initial allocations, check if any agent envies another's allocation and make adjustments accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation process:

### Initial Allocation
1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most, followed by item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 6 and 4.

### Allocation Steps
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

After these initial allocations based on the highest single valuations, we distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 5 (next highest values after 2).
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (next highest value after 1).
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 7 (remaining items with reasonable values for Agent 2).

### Final Allocation
We ensure that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their reported valuations while distributing the items fairly across all agents.
