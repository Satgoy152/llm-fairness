Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  41  15  12  79  22  32   6
1  52  67  29  56  66  60  73  42
2  59  61  50   7  30   5  91  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple heuristic approach. This involves attempting to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. The goal is to find an allocation such that each agent feels they are getting the best possible share of the items.

Let's break down the problem and find an allocation:

1. **List each agent's valuations for all items:**
   - Agent 0: [66, 41, 15, 12, 79, 22, 32, 6]
   - Agent 1: [52, 67, 29, 56, 66, 60, 73, 42]
   - Agent 2: [59, 61, 50, 7, 30, 5, 91, 72]

2. **Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent valuations:**
   - Prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most.

3. **Implement allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items they value highly: 4 (79), 0 (66)
   - Agent 1 gets items they value highly: 6 (73), 1 (67)
   - Agent 2 gets items they value highly: 7 (72), 5 (5)

4. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: 2, 3
   - Consider filling gaps by assigning items to agents with fewer total valuations or fewer items.

5. **Final allocation decisions:**
   - Agent 0 can take item 3 (valued at 12, not highly contested)
   - Agent 1 can take item 2 (valued at 29, better than agent 0â€™s valuation)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation strives to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items.
