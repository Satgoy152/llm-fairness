Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  66  99  93  29  54  26  75
1  82  76  42  34  97   9   3  55
2  30  95   3  71  73  78  36  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 66 99 93 29 54 26 75]
 [82 76 42 34 97  9  3 55]
 [30 95  3 71 73 78 36 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations provided for each item by each agent. The goal is to assign items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's begin by reviewing the valuations:

- Agent 0: [97, 66, 99, 93, 29, 54, 26, 75]
- Agent 1: [82, 76, 42, 34, 97, 9, 3, 55]
- Agent 2: [30, 95, 3, 71, 73, 78, 36, 40]

To achieve a fair division, we will use a round-robin method to allocate items to the agents based on the highest value each agent assigns to the remaining available items.

1. **Agent 0** gets item 2 (value 99 for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 4 (value 97 for agent 1).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 1 (value 95 for agent 2).
4. **Agent 0** gets item 0 (value 97 for agent 0).
5. **Agent 2** gets item 5 (value 78 for agent 2).
6. **Agent 0** gets item 3 (value 93 for agent 0).
7. **Agent 1** gets item 7 (value 55 for agent 1).
8. **Agent 2** gets item 6 (value 36 for agent 2).

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

Each agent received items in a way that reflects their valuations, ensuring a fair distribution across agents.
