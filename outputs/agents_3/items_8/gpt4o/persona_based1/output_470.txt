Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  87  28  49   2  64  99   0
1  87  57  75  23   5  94  89  82
2  98  14  68  96  21  53  36  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0's highest valued items: 6 (99), 1 (87), and 0 (68).
- Agent 1's highest valued items: 5 (94), 0 (87), and 6 (89).
- Agent 2's highest valued items: 0 (98), 3 (96), and 2 (68).

A possible approach to achieve this is to attempt to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is roughly balanced. Given the constraints, we will aim to allocate 8 items in total.

### Steps:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them and is their most valued item.
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as it is one of their highest valued items.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for them.
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their second most valued item.
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it reasonably well and it is not the top choice for any other agent.
7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest value after the already allocated items.
8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as it balances the allocation and they have some value for it.

By following these steps, we attempt to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [5, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures every agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, while also maintaining integer allocations.
