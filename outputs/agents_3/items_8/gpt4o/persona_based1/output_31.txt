Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49   7   5  49   0  12   6   9
1  24  78  94  85  98  73  56  88
2  72  61  66  63  64  42  85  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent feels that another agent has received a better bundle of items according to their own subjective valuations.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy that aims to give each agent items they value highly, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items.
   - There are 8 items and 3 agents, so one possible allocation would be to give two agents 3 items each and one agent 2 items.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by allocating items to the agents based on their highest valuations in descending order while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (98), item 2 (94), and item 3 (85).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 7 (96), item 6 (85), and item 0 (72).
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (49) and item 3 (49).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 1**: Assign items 4, 2, and 3 because these are the highest valued items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 7, 6, and 0 because these are the highest valued items for Agent 2.
- **Agent 0**: Assign items 1 and 5 because these are the next best available items for Agent 0 after the higher preference items have been allocated to other agents.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items and aims to maintain envy-freeness to the best extent possible given the constraints.

**Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 2, 3],
    "2": [7, 6, 0]
}
```

This allocation uses all items and respects the constraint that each agent can only receive an integer number of items.
