Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  66  65  92  71  86  73  92
1  23  97  53  99  31  19   7  52
2  66  62  74  13   0  75  77  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [66 62 74 13  0 75 77 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints), we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations. We need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not prefer another agentâ€™s bundle over their own.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 6.

To proceed, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while minimizing envy among the agents.

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 99) as it's their highest value.
2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (valued at 92) as it's one of their highest values.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (valued at 74) as it's one of their highest values.
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (valued at 75), another high value for Agent 2.
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (valued at 77), completing their high-value set.
6. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 97).
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 65).
8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (valued at 71).

This allocation tries to maximize the value each agent gets and attempts to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are distributed among the agents.
