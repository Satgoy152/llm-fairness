Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  94   9  93  61  17  55  76
1  67  79  91  63  41   1  63   3
2  11  92  45  54  98  25  44  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness is often difficult, so we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [19, 94, 9, 93, 61, 17, 55, 76]
- Agent 1: [67, 79, 91, 63, 41, 1, 63, 3]
- Agent 2: [11, 92, 45, 54, 98, 25, 44, 42]

A potential strategy is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This method often leads to a fair distribution but might require adjustments to ensure each agent receives a similar number of items.

Let's allocate:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 (67)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (94)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 (91)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (93)
5. Item 4: Agent 2 (98)
6. Item 5: Agent 2 (25)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (55)
8. Item 7: Agent 0 (76)

Now, let's ensure a balanced distribution in terms of the number of items:

- Agent 0: [1, 3, 6, 7] - 4 items
- Agent 1: [0, 2] - 2 items
- Agent 2: [4, 5] - 2 items

This ensures each agent receives items and each item is allocated. The distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
