Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  59  36   0  45  38  23  54
1  52  94  25  83  33  93  61  39
2  69  24  72  56  34  48  56   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. We will use a heuristic approach to achieve a reasonable allocation.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their preferences:

- Agent 0's total value: 16 + 59 + 36 + 0 + 45 + 38 + 23 + 54 = 271
- Agent 1's total value: 52 + 94 + 25 + 83 + 33 + 93 + 61 + 39 = 480
- Agent 2's total value: 69 + 24 + 72 + 56 + 34 + 48 + 56 + 5 = 364

Given these total valuations, we aim to allocate items to each agent such that the sum of the values of the items each agent receives is approximately equal, or at least makes each agent feel they are getting a fair share.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items with the highest values for each agent, then adjust for fairness:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 1 (59), 7 (54), and 5 (38).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1 (94), 5 (93), and 3 (83).
   - Agent 2 highly values items 0 (69), 2 (72), and 3 (56).

2. After considering these high-value preferences and ensuring all items are allocated, we aim to balance the number of items and perceived value.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 7, 6]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 4]

Let's now present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution given the initial preferences.
