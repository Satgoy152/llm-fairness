Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2   8  21  80  63   2  25  29
1  14  20  49  13  12  22  70  43
2  65  77  21  36  84  38  27  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their respective valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and seeks fairness. One common approach to achieve envy-freeness is to use a method like the maximum sum or the adjusted winner procedure, but since we are constrained to integer allocations, we'll use a method that approximates envy-freeness.

Here's a systematic approach to allocating the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Assign items where each agent has a significantly higher valuation compared to others.

2. **Check for Remaining Items**: After initial allocations, check which items are left and distribute them to minimize envy.

3. **Ensure Full Allocation**: Make sure all 8 items are allocated without overlap.

Let's go through each agent's preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest (80), followed by item 4 (63).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the highest (70), followed by item 2 (49).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (84), followed by item 1 (77).

Given these preferences, we can begin by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, distribute remaining items to balance the allocation:

- **Remaining items**: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7

Continue distributing:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (high relative value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (high relative value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for this item).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for this item).

The allocation is now complete:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation strives to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
