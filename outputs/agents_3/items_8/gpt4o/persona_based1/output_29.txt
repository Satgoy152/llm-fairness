Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  87   5  23  43  67  36   9
1  86  65  86  53  51  35  96  25
2  20  42  36  90  65  78  46  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent's allocation is better than their own, based on their valuations. The challenge is to achieve an allocation where each agent perceives they have received a fair share.

Let's consider each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 47 + 87 + 5 + 23 + 43 + 67 + 36 + 9 = 317
- Agent 1: 86 + 65 + 86 + 53 + 51 + 35 + 96 + 25 = 497
- Agent 2: 20 + 42 + 36 + 90 + 65 + 78 + 46 + 29 = 406

The goal is to allocate items such that each agentâ€™s perceived value of their allocation is as balanced as possible.

A possible fair distribution could be:

- Agent 0 is given items 1, 5, and 7, with a total perceived value of 87 + 67 + 9 = 163.
- Agent 1 is given items 0, 2, and 6, with a total perceived value of 86 + 86 + 96 = 268.
- Agent 2 is given items 3 and 4, with a total perceived value of 90 + 65 = 155.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: 163 out of 317
- Agent 1: 268 out of 497
- Agent 2: 155 out of 406

The allocations are not perfectly proportional to their total valuations, but they are balanced with respect to the items' perceived values by each agent and are fair given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
