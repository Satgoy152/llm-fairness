Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  82  67  21  81  14   5  29
1  93  76  98  59  30   0  32  10
2   6  99  97  53  19   0  60  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 99 97 53 19  0 60 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if each agent believes they have received a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [15, 82, 67, 21, 81, 14, 5, 29]
Agent 1: [93, 76, 98, 59, 30,  0, 32, 10]
Agent 2: [6, 99, 97, 53, 19,  0, 60, 19]
```

One approach is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's preference while ensuring each has a fair share. 

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (98), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (99), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most (81), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
4. For the remaining items, we consider remaining preferences and ensure an even distribution:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 93 for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 60 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 53 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 29 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 14 for Agent 0).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly and prevents envy by balancing the allocation.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 6, 3]
}
```
