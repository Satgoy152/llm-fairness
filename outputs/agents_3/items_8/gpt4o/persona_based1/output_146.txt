Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  48  86  61  74  70   1  24
1  35  13  51  22  37  14  75  86
2  62  17  47  53  96  46  46  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 48 86 61 74 70  1 24]
 [35 13 51 22 37 14 75 86]
 [62 17 47 53 96 46 46 25]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [44, 48, 86, 61, 74, 70, 1, 24]
- Agent 1 values: [35, 13, 51, 22, 37, 14, 75, 86]
- Agent 2 values: [62, 17, 47, 53, 96, 46, 46, 25]

Given these valuations, we can allocate the items prioritizing each agent's highest valuation to minimize envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued items: Item 2 (86), Item 4 (74), Item 5 (70)
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 7 (86), Item 6 (75)
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: Item 4 (96), Item 0 (62)

### Adjusting to Ensure All Items are Allocated:

After the initial allocation based on highest values:
- **Agent 0:** Items [2, 4, 5]
- **Agent 1:** Items [7, 6]
- **Agent 2:** Items [0]

Remaining items: 1, 3

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it increases their total valuation by 48.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since it increases their total valuation by 53.

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Items [2, 4, 5, 1]
- **Agent 1:** Items [7, 6]
- **Agent 2:** Items [0, 3]

This allocation attempts to be as fair as possible given the initial values and ensures all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 1],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
