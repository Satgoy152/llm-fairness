Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  71  26  72  82  98  25  89
1  75  83  15  40  54  49  45  25
2  99  72  42  19  72  34  13  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 72 42 19 72 34 13 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the data, the objective is to distribute the items such that each agent is content with their share based on their valuations.

Let's assess the valuation matrix and consider possible allocations:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 4 (82), Item 7 (89)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (83), Item 0 (75), Item 3 (40)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 7 (94), Item 1 (72)

A possible allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first, ensuring no overlap.
2. Proceed to allocate remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Using this strategy, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 5, 4, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 7, 2

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 7, 2]
}
```
