Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  46  21  40  91  78   9  62
1  57  70  39  34  56  49   4  98
2  45  40  85  91  11   3  67  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 46 21 40 91 78  9 62]
 [57 70 39 34 56 49  4 98]
 [45 40 85 91 11  3 67 94]]
Output:
In order to achieve a fair division of items amongst the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to minimize envy. One way to do this is to use the concept of maximizing total utility for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [90, 46, 21, 40, 91, 78, 9, 62]
- Agent 1: [57, 70, 39, 34, 56, 49, 4, 98]
- Agent 2: [45, 40, 85, 91, 11, 3, 67, 94]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest value items: 4 (91), 0 (90), 5 (78)
    - Allocate items 0, 4, and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
    - Highest value items: 7 (98), 1 (70), 4 (56)
    - Item 4 is already allocated, so consider next highest: 2 (39)
    - Allocate items 1, 2, and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
    - Highest value items: 3 (91), 7 (94), 2 (85)
    - Items 2 and 7 are already allocated, so consider next highest: 6 (67)
    - Allocate items 3 and 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and no item is double-allocated. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
