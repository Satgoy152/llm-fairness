Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  56   2  11  32  16  96  74
1  35  74  61  17  99  40  60  77
2  70   7  56  42  29  18  76  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54 56  2 11 32 16 96 74]
 [35 74 61 17 99 40 60 77]
 [70  7 56 42 29 18 76 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. In other words, each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [54, 56,  2, 11, 32, 16, 96, 74]
Agent 1: [35, 74, 61, 17, 99, 40, 60, 77]
Agent 2: [70,  7, 56, 42, 29, 18, 76, 36]
```

1. **Agent 0's highest values**: Items 6 (96), 7 (74)
2. **Agent 1's highest values**: Items 4 (99), 1 (74), 7 (77)
3. **Agent 2's highest values**: Items 0 (70), 6 (76)

### Allocation Strategy
- We want each agent's allocation to maximize their total valuation while ensuring no envy.
- Try to allocate high-value items to agents who value them most.

#### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** should get Item 6 (96) and Item 7 (74), as these maximize their value.
2. **Agent 1** should get Item 4 (99) and Item 1 (74), as these are highly valued.
3. **Agent 2** should get Item 0 (70), one of their highest valued items.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 3, 5.

4. **Agent 2** should get Item 2 (56) as it is highly valued by them.
5. **Agent 2** should also get Item 3 (42) and Item 5 (18) as they have relatively higher values for these items compared to other agents.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 3, 5]

### Final Allocation JSON:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that provide high personal values based on their preferences, and the distribution is envy-free.
