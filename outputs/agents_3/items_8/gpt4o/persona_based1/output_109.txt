Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  74  34  35  69  67  16   9
1  65   7  67  17  56  48  38  30
2  59  32  79  76  44  10  89  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, one approach is to use a fair division method, such as the adjusted winner procedure or other similar algorithms. However, since these methods can be complex and beyond the scope of a simple computation, I'll provide a basic allocation considering the valuations provided. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or envy-free as possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [4, 74, 34, 35, 69, 67, 16, 9]
Agent 1: [65, 7, 67, 17, 56, 48, 38, 30]
Agent 2: [59, 32, 79, 76, 44, 10, 89, 71]
```

A simple heuristic is to try to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items. Let's aim for each agent to receive at least 2-3 items, given there are 8 items and 3 agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 (value 74 for Agent 0, highest among all agents)
   - Item 4 (value 69 for Agent 0, highest among all agents)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 (value 48 for Agent 1, highest among all agents)
   - Item 0 (value 65 for Agent 1, highest among all agents)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2 (value 79 for Agent 2, highest among all agents)
   - Item 3 (value 76 for Agent 2, highest among all agents)
   - Item 6 (value 89 for Agent 2, highest among all agents)
   - Item 7 (value 71 for Agent 2, highest among all agents)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations, reducing potential envy.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items they highly value.
