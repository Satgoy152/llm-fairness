Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  56  14  57  71  47  47  44
1  34  91  10  44  73  26  52  75
2  24  22  83  30  69  56  96  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible, and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items. The concept of envy-freeness suggests that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the situation by considering the agents' preferences and try to achieve a balanced allocation:

**Valuations Table:**

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 52 | 56 | 14 | 57 | 71 | 47 | 47 | 44 |
| 1            | 34 | 91 | 10 | 44 | 73 | 26 | 52 | 75 |
| 2            | 24 | 22 | 83 | 30 | 69 | 56 | 96 | 63 |

To allocate the items, we can use a simple heuristic: assign the item to the agent who values it the most, provided it does not create a significant imbalance in the total valuation received by each agent. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it highest (52).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it highest (91).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it highest (83).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it highest (57).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it highest (71), but to balance, give to Agent 1 (73).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it highest (56).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it highest (96).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it highest (75).

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3] = 52 + 57 = 109
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4, 7] = 91 + 73 + 75 = 239
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5, 6] = 83 + 56 + 96 = 235

This allocation balances the total valuations among the agents relatively well, given the constraints. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
