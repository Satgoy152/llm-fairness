Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   6   4  51  25  30  35  90
1  62  49   4  89  74  62  95  48
2  52  65  38  37  91  51  14  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 65 38 37 91 51 14 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to approximate an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use the maximum marginal valuations and attempt to allocate items to maximize perceived fairness.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   6   4  51  25  30  35  90
1  62  49   4  89  74  62  95  48
2  52  65  38  37  91  51  14  13
```

We observe the following:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 highest (90).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highest (95).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highest (91).

Let's start by allocating these high-value items to each agent to satisfy their strongest preference:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Next, we proceed by considering the remaining items and their valuations:

1. For Agent 0, we should consider items that they value after item 7, such as items 3 and 6. However, item 6 is already allocated, so we consider item 3.
2. For Agent 1, after item 6, items 3 and 4 are highly valued but already allocated, so we consider item 5.
3. For Agent 2, items 1 and 0 are valued after item 4, so we consider item 1.

Continuing this process and ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items (3 each, as there are 9 items in total), we can proceed with the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4.

However, since we have 8 items and 3 agents, we must ensure each agent receives close to an equal share.

Let's finalize the allocation ensuring all items are distributed fairly:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 6]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
