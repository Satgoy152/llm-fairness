Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  75   6   9  28  92  86  20
1   5  41  12  26  60  59  50  18
2  72  76  28  74  44  70  14  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items another agent receives over their own bundle. Here is one potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 (75) and item 5 (92) highly. We prioritize giving them these items.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (60) and item 5 (59) highly, but since item 5 is allocated to Agent 0, we give Agent 1 item 4.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (72), item 1 (76), and item 3 (74) highly. Item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, so we give Agent 2 items 0 and 3.

Let's determine a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 5 (total value = 75 + 92 = 167)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 6, 7 (total value = 60 + 50 + 18 = 128)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 3, 2 (total value = 72 + 74 + 28 = 174)

This allocation considers the high valuation items for each agent, trying to minimize envy. The agents receive the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a bundle that reflects their relatively high valuations and distributes all 8 items.
