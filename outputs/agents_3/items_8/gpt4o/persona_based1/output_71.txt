Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  35  29  43  87  30  94  67
1  91  54  52  31  38  65  84  95
2  21  33  42  96  54  80  74  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy.

Here is the breakdown of the process:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6.
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0.
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3.

2. **Allocate based on highest valuations:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Review remaining items and assign based on maximizing individual agent's total value while ensuring envy-freeness:**

   - For Agent 0:
     - After assigning item 6, consider items that maximize the value without causing significant envy.
     - Assign item 7 (value 67) and item 4 (value 87) to Agent 0.

   - For Agent 1:
     - After assigning item 0, consider items that maximize the value without causing significant envy.
     - Assign item 1 (value 54) and item 5 (value 65) to Agent 1.

   - For Agent 2:
     - After assigning item 3, consider items that maximize the value without causing significant envy.
     - Assign item 2 (value 42) to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining items:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 since it has relatively high value (80) for Agent 2.

5. **Final Allocation:**

Now ensuring all items are allocated, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valuations and distributing the remaining items to balance total values while ensuring that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation.
