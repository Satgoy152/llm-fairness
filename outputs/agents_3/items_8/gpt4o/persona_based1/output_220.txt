Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  57   0  60  57  94  45  35
1   5  23   8  74  88  25  55  22
2  12  94  37   6  10  56  89   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all the items, and the maximum value they assign to any single item:

- Agent 0: Total value = 355, Maximum value for a single item = 94
- Agent 1: Total value = 300, Maximum value for a single item = 88
- Agent 2: Total value = 307, Maximum value for a single item = 94

The allocation strategy that we will use aims to balance the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while trying to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation. We will consider the agents' valuations for the items and try to allocate items starting from the highest valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has a particularly high valuation for item 5. We can start by allocating item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** highly values items 3 and 4. Since Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 and a very high valuation for item 3, we'll allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values items 1 and 6 highly. We'll allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. For the remaining items (0, 2, and 7), we need to distribute them such that the distribution remains fair:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 higher than the other agents, so item 0 can be allocated to Agent 0.
   - Items 2 and 7 have relatively low values across agents, but Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 7 than the others, making it reasonable to allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, item 2 can be allocated to Agent 0, as it has a low valuation across all agents, and Agent 0 can accept it to balance the number of items.

This allocation aims to maintain fair distribution while respecting each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```
