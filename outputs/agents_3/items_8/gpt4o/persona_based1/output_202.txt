Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  34  21  92  35  90   3  32
1  21  87   2  32  77  84  77  90
2  52  91   6   1  44  12  39  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 92). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** The highest value for Agent 1 is item 7 (value 90). Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (value 91). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

We continue by allocating the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0:** The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 (value 90). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1:** The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 77). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2:** The next highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 52). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

7. **Agent 0:** The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 1, but itâ€™s already taken. The next available is item 2 (value 21). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 2:** The next highest available item for Agent 2 is item 6 (value 39). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated all 8 items. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [1, 0, 6]
}
```
