Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  23  75  17  61  32  51  69
1  68   2  76  99  61  31  20  40
2  96  61  63  79  98  20  83  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for envy-freeness, where each agent prefers their own allocation over the others' allocations. Since we have three agents and eight items, each agent should ideally get around 2 to 3 items. Here is one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Items 0 (81) and 2 (75).
   - Medium valuation: Item 7 (69).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuation: Item 3 (99).
   - Medium valuations: Items 0 (68) and 4 (61).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Items 4 (98) and 0 (96).
   - Medium valuations: Item 6 (83).

Starting with the highest valuation, we distribute the items:

- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1** as it is the highest value for any agent.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2** since it has a higher value for Agent 2 compared to Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0** because it is the next highest value for Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2** since it is the highest remaining value for Agent 2.
- **Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0** to complete a fair distribution for Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0** since it is the least valued item and Agent 0 can take it without any envy issues.
- **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2** as it is the least valued item and Agent 2 can take it.
- **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1** as it is the least valued item and Agent 1 can take it.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value and respects the constraints of the problem.
