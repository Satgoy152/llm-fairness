Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  96  14  42  68  93  49  48
1  76  75  24  61  90  99  58  50
2  10  83  45   4  15  28  71   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 96 14 42 68 93 49 48]
 [76 75 24 61 90 99 58 50]
 [10 83 45  4 15 28 71  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the valuations of each agent for each item and attempt to create an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. Given the valuations in the table, we can employ a strategy such as maximizing the minimum utility or iteratively assigning items based on the highest relative valuation.

Here are the valuations of each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [9, 96, 14, 42, 68, 93, 49, 48]
- Agent 1: [76, 75, 24, 61, 90, 99, 58, 50]
- Agent 2: [10, 83, 45, 4, 15, 28, 71, 6]

To attempt an envy-free allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least some items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
3. Consider reducing envy by reallocating items if necessary.

Based on this approach, one possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 4, 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 2, 3, 7

This allocation is based on each agent getting items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences and the total items available.
