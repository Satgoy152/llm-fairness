Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  52  15  57   8  69  32  26
1  98  88   0  46  45  64  84  97
2  59  93  84  16  14  44   9  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation would be ideal, but given the constraints, we will aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 76 + 52 + 15 + 57 + 8 + 69 + 32 + 26 = 335
- Agent 1: 98 + 88 + 0 + 46 + 45 + 64 + 84 + 97 = 522
- Agent 2: 59 + 93 + 84 + 16 + 14 + 44 + 9 + 90 = 409

Given that there are three agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive approximately \( \frac{335+522+409}{3} \approx 422 \) in total value, though exact equality may not be possible. The goal is to distribute items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Consider the valuations for each item and attempt to distribute items to balance overall happiness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High value on item 0 (76) and item 5 (69).
   - Assign items: [0, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value on item 0 (98), item 1 (88), item 7 (97), and item 6 (84). However, item 0 goes to Agent 0.
   - Assign items: [1, 7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High values on item 1 (93), item 2 (84), and item 7 (90). Item 1 goes to Agent 1.
   - Assign items: [2, 6]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4:

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0: 57
  - Agent 1: 46
  - Agent 2: 16
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it maximizes his valuation.

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 8
  - Agent 1: 45
  - Agent 2: 14
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it maximizes his valuation.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 7, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]

This allocation balances the distribution of high-value items among the agents based on their individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
