Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  19  81  77  84  94   0  51
1  86  33  20   2  16  86  35  75
2  79  46  69  48  13  74  53  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and find an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most, followed by items 4, 2, 3, 0, 7, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most, followed by items 5, 7, 1, 2, 6, 4, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most, followed by items 2, 5, 7, 3, 1, 6, and 4.

We can use a round-robin method, starting with the agent who values their top item the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 1** gets item 0 since they value it the highest (86).
- **Agent 0** gets item 5 since it's their highest remaining preference (94).
- **Agent 2** gets item 2 as it's their highest remaining preference (69).

Next round:

- **Agent 0** gets item 4 (84), their next highest preference.
- **Agent 1** gets item 7 (75), their next highest preference.
- **Agent 2** gets item 3 (48), their next highest preference.

Final round:

- **Agent 0** gets item 6 (0), the only item left.
- **Agent 1** gets item 1 (33).

Now, let's verify the allocations:
- Agent 0: 5, 4, 6
- Agent 1: 0, 7, 1
- Agent 2: 2, 3

Each agent has received a fair share of items based on their individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
