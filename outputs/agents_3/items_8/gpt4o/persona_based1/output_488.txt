Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  45  24  27  79  60  97  75
1  41  65  26  57  58  35  84  82
2  94  26  22  71  85  32  99  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider the total valuations each agent has for all items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their share according to their valuations.

Let's summarize the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 81 + 45 + 24 + 27 + 79 + 60 + 97 + 75 = 488
- Agent 1: 41 + 65 + 26 + 57 + 58 + 35 + 84 + 82 = 448
- Agent 2: 94 + 26 + 22 + 71 + 85 + 32 + 99 + 60 = 489

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their total valuation. We'll try to ensure that each agent receives items that collectively approximate their proportion of the total value.

The total value of all items across all agents is:
- Total = 488 (Agent 0) + 448 (Agent 1) + 489 (Agent 2) = 1425

The fair share for each agent, based on their total valuation, would be approximately:
- Agent 0: 488 / 1425
- Agent 1: 448 / 1425
- Agent 2: 489 / 1425

To achieve this, we will assign items to agents based on their highest individual valuations, ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Here's a proposed allocation based on maximizing satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 and 0. Assign items 6 and 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 7. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 and 6, but 6 is taken, so assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, considering the remaining items:

4. Agent 0 can also receive item 5 (next highest value after 0 and 6).
5. Agent 1 can receive items 3 and 1 (high values).
6. Agent 2 can receive items 2.

Let's verify this distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 7, 3, 1
- Agent 2: Items 4, 2

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 81 + 60 + 97 = 238
- Agent 1: 82 + 57 + 65 = 204
- Agent 2: 85 + 22 = 107

While this does not perfectly match the ideal proportional division, it aims to minimize envy by giving agents the items they value the most. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [7, 3, 1],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
