Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  22  13  88  81  65  61  11
1  23  21  96  94   1   7   4   7
2  72  35  89  33  20  83  81  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation to any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuations.

First, let's analyze the total valuations each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(61 + 22 + 13 + 88 + 81 + 65 + 61 + 11 = 402\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(23 + 21 + 96 + 94 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 7 = 253\)
- Agent 2's total valuation: \(72 + 35 + 89 + 33 + 20 + 83 + 81 + 78 = 491\)

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Assign items based on the highest individual valuations to minimize envy:**

   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (96) and item 3 (94), so we allocate these items to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 5 (83) and item 6 (81), so we allocate these items to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (88) but it's already allocated to Agent 1, so we allocate the next highest valued items that are available, item 0 (61) and item 4 (81), to Agent 0.

2. **Continue allocating based on remaining high preferences:**

   - With items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 allocated, we are left with items 1 and 7.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 (22) more than the other agents, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - For item 7, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (78), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 4
- Agent 1: Item 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6, and 7

This allocation ensures that agents receive items they value highly, reducing potential envy. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
