Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60   6  67  17   8  32  36  89
1   9  84  21  95   8  47  21  91
2  20  36  11   1  42  27  39  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free, we should aim to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here, I will use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent while ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 3, 1, and 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 4, 6, and 7 highly.

Given these preferences, we can attempt to allocate the items to maximize overall satisfaction and minimize envy:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: This is highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This is highly valued by Agent 1.
3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This is highly valued by Agent 0.
4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: This is highly valued by Agent 1.
5. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2**: This is highly valued by Agent 2.
6. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1**: To balance Agent 1's allocation.
7. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 2**: This is highly valued by Agent 2.
8. **Allocate item 7 to Agent 0**: This is highly valued by Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to ensure that each agent receives an allocation they value highly.
