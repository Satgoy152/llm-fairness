Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  74  47  79  69  78  39  93
1  66  48  87  21  85  47  82  82
2  30  88  45  48  52   8   7  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 48 87 21 85 47 82 82]
 [30 88 45 48 52  8  7 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations. 

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [6, 74, 47, 79, 69, 78, 39, 93]
- Agent 1: [66, 48, 87, 21, 85, 47, 82, 82]
- Agent 2: [30, 88, 45, 48, 52, 8, 7, 23]

We aim to distribute the items among the agents as evenly as possible based on these preferences.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 7 (93) and 3 (79).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2 (87) and 4 (85).
   - Agent 2 highly values items 1 (88) and 4 (52).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6.

4. **Complete Allocation Considering Preferences:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 due to its high valuation (79).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 since it is also highly valued by Agent 1 (85).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 since it has a relatively high valuation (78).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it (82).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

Each agent receives a portion of the items according to their preferences, aiming to minimize envy among them. This allocation is balanced based on the valuations provided.
