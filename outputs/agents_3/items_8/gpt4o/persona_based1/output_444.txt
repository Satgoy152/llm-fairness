Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  58  92  80  87  98  69  93
1   2  28  21  66  19  24  34  40
2  89  41  46  44  13  60  54  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and the valuations provided, we'll employ a strategy that seeks to balance the perceived value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels another has received more value than they have. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. To maximize their perceived value, we will allocate these items to them.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has relatively lower valuations across the items, but items 3 and 7 provide higher value compared to others they value. We'll allocate these items to them.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 5 and 7. They also have a substantial valuation for item 0, but since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, we'll focus on other high-value items for Agent 2. We'll allocate items 4, 5, and 6 to them.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 5, 6.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's perceived value based on the given valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
