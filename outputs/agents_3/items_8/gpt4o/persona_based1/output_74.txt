Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  48  75  25  52  85  68   2
1  28  13  64  92  59  75  51  87
2  13  36  20  87  73  89  18  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Value for Each Agent
First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(62 + 48 + 75 + 25 + 52 + 85 + 68 + 2 = 417\)
- Agent 1: \(28 + 13 + 64 + 92 + 59 + 75 + 51 + 87 = 469\)
- Agent 2: \(13 + 36 + 20 + 87 + 73 + 89 + 18 + 91 = 427\)

### Step 2: Calculate Proportional Fair Share
Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive approximately \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total value of all items:

- Total value of all items: \(417 + 469 + 427 = 1313\)
- Proportional fair share for each agent: \(\frac{1313}{3} \approx 437.67\)

### Step 3: Allocate Items to Minimize Envy
We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets close to their proportional fair share.

#### Initial Allocation:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0 (value = 62), 2 (value = 75), 5 (value = 85), 6 (value = 68)
  - Total value: \(62 + 75 + 85 + 68 = 290\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 3 (value = 92), 4 (value = 59), 7 (value = 87)
  - Total value: \(92 + 59 + 87 = 238\)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: 1 (value = 36), 4 (value = 73), 6 (value = 89), 7 (value = 91)
  - Total value: \(36 + 73 + 89 + 91 = 289\)

#### Adjust Allocation for Fairness:
To improve fairness, we need to redistribute to better balance the allocations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Items: 0, 2, 6
  - Total value: \(62 + 75 + 68 = 205\)

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Items: 3, 5
  - Total value: \(92 + 75 = 167\)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: 1, 4, 7
  - Total value: \(36 + 73 + 91 = 200\)

### Final Allocation:
Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent's total value is as balanced as possible:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0, 5, 6
  - Total value: \(62 + 85 + 68 = 215\)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 3, 2
  - Total value: \(92 + 75 = 167\)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: 1, 4, 7
  - Total value: \(36 + 73 + 91 = 200\)

### JSON Representation of Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to keep the total values as balanced as possible across agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.
