Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  49  15  84  42  92  22  49
1  28  84  72  45  31  27  89  49
2  75  51  87  88  35  66  16  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents while aiming for fairness and minimizing envy, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own preferences.

Let's first consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(76 + 49 + 15 + 84 + 42 + 92 + 22 + 49 = 429\)
- Agent 1: \(28 + 84 + 72 + 45 + 31 + 27 + 89 + 49 = 425\)
- Agent 2: \(75 + 51 + 87 + 88 + 35 + 66 + 16 + 26 = 444\)

Next, let's aim to distribute the items such that the perceived value is roughly equal for each agent, while taking into account their individual valuations. We will use a heuristic approach to try to balance these values.

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first, if possible, and then proceed with other items in descending order of value for each individual agent.
2. We need to ensure that every agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 92, so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 84, so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 88, so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now let's allocate the remaining items by considering each agent's next highest value:

- Agent 0: After item 5, the next highest valued item is item 3 (84), but it's already taken, so the next is item 0 (76). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: After item 1, the next highest is item 2 (72). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: After item 3, the next is item 2 (87), but it's taken, so the next is item 5 (66), but it's taken. Next is item 0 (75), but it's taken. Next is item 4 (35). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Continuing this process:

- Agent 0: Next after item 0 is item 1 (49), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (49). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Next after item 2 is item 6 (89). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Next after item 4 is item 6 (16), but it's taken. Next is item 2 (87), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (26), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (51), but it's taken. Next is item 0 (75), but it's taken. Next is item 5 (66), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (88), but it's taken. Assign remaining item 3 to Agent 2.

Finally, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 0, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4

This allocation covers all 8 items, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
