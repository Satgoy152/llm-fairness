Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  42  66  61  41   3  66  94
1  53  57  36  79  33  60  74  62
2  49  95  31  70   0  68   9  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring every item is allocated to one agent. One approach is to use the Envy-Free algorithm, which attempts to give each agent a bundle of items they value as much as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 7 the most (94), followed by items 2 and 6 (both 66). Assign items 2, 6, and 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 the most (79), followed by item 6 (74). Since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the most (95), and since item 3 has already been allocated to Agent 1 and item 6 to Agent 0, assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring they receive bundles that reflect their preferences as closely as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items and provides each agent with a bundle of items, respecting their preferences as much as possible.
