Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  77   7  36  87  11  77  17
1  97  77  85  47   7  20  64  43
2  88  26  53   4  23  90  96  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and maximize the total value each agent receives. This task involves balancing the allocations to ensure that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's break down the valuations and consider potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - High value on items 0, 1, 4, and 6 (77, 77, 87, 77)
   
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - High value on items 0, 2, and 3 (97, 85, 47)
   
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**  
   - High value on items 6, 7, and 5 (96, 99, 90)

Given these observations, we can try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0:**  
  Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly and are less valued by others, if possible.
  
- **Agent 1:**  
  Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly and are less valued by others, if possible.
  
- **Agent 2:**  
  Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly and are less valued by others, if possible.

### Proposed Allocations:

- **Agent 0:**  
  Items 0, 1, 4 (values: 77, 77, 87)

- **Agent 1:**  
  Items 2, 3 (values: 85, 47)

- **Agent 2:**  
  Items 5, 6, 7 (values: 90, 96, 99)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while keeping the distribution even.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
