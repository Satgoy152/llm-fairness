Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  74  49  69   7  44  89  58
1  30  64  47  22  76  83   0  65
2  83  33  66  95   3  19  23  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuation of the items. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that they have received a fair share of the total value based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent has for all items and then try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. The goal here is to distribute the items in a way that each agent believes they have received a fair portion of the total value.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(54 + 74 + 49 + 69 + 7 + 44 + 89 + 58 = 444\)
- Agent 1: \(30 + 64 + 47 + 22 + 76 + 83 + 0 + 65 = 387\)
- Agent 2: \(83 + 33 + 66 + 95 + 3 + 19 + 23 + 52 = 374\)

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that tries to balance these valuations:

1. **Assign the most valued items to each agent** to ensure they feel they received high-value items.
2. **Try to balance the total value of items received by each agent** relative to their total valuations.

A possible allocation solution could be:

- Agent 0 gets items: 6, 1, 0 (Highest values are 89, 74, 54)
- Agent 1 gets items: 5, 7, 4 (Highest values are 83, 65, 76)
- Agent 2 gets items: 3, 2 (Highest values are 95, 66)

Checking the allocations:

- Agent 0: Total value = \(89 + 74 + 54 = 217\)
- Agent 1: Total value = \(83 + 65 + 76 = 224\)
- Agent 2: Total value = \(95 + 66 = 161\)

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valued items, thus reducing potential envy.

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 0],
    "1": [5, 7, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, each agent receives items, and the value distribution is relatively balanced based on each agent's preferences.
