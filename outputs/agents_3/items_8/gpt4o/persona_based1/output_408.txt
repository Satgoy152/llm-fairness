Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21   4  65   4  30  54  80  39
1  72  12  48  61  31  64  53  99
2  48  15   6  87  26   9  57  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 12 48 61 31 64 53 99]
 [48 15  6 87 26  9 57 55]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common goal is to ensure envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their own valuations.

We can use a greedy algorithm to allocate items by iteratively assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [21, 4, 65, 4, 30, 54, 80, 39]
Agent 1: [72, 12, 48, 61, 31, 64, 53, 99]
Agent 2: [48, 15, 6, 87, 26, 9, 57, 55]
```

We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (72).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (15).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (65).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (87).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (30).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (64).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (99).

Now, let's check the distribution to make sure each agent has an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3]

This allocation gives each agent a total of 3, 3, and 2 items respectively, which is integer-based and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation matches the constraint of allocating all items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
