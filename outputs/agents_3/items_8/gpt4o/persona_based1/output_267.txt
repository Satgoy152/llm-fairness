Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  82  24  45  70  37  76  54
1  59  84  88  77  17   1  85  22
2  70  73  22   7  15  24  55  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 84 88 77 17  1 85 22]
 [70 73 22  7 15 24 55 64]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We will use a method to approach envy-freeness, ensuring no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [61, 82, 24, 45, 70, 37, 76, 54]
Agent 1: [59, 84, 88, 77, 17,  1, 85, 22]
Agent 2: [70, 73, 22,  7, 15, 24, 55, 64]
```

Each agent should ideally receive items that they value highly. We can aim to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is approximately balanced, and no agent envies another's allocation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations are for items 1, 4, and 6. We allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations are for items 2, 3, and 6. We allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations are for items 0, 5, and 7. We allocate items 0, 5, 3, and 7 to Agent 2.

This allocation results in:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 4] with total valuation 152.
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 6] with total valuation 173.
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 5, 3, 7] with total valuation 161.

The resulting allocation minimizes envy while maintaining fairness by considering the agents' highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives items they value significantly.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 5, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
