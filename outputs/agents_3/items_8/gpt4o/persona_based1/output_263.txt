Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  18  98  41  24  14  16  14
1  70  46  37  77  80  85  73  71
2  68  40  51  93  30  47  33  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to attempt a distribution that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this allocation:

1. **Identify Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

2. **Propose Initial Allocation:**
   - Attempt to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations to approximate fairness.

3. **Check for Envy and Adjust:**
   - Ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own. Adjust if necessary.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Confirm that all items are allocated and that the distribution appears fair.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent
- Agent 0: 72 + 18 + 98 + 41 + 24 + 14 + 16 + 14 = 297
- Agent 1: 70 + 46 + 37 + 77 + 80 + 85 + 73 + 71 = 539
- Agent 2: 68 + 40 + 51 + 93 + 30 + 47 + 33 + 56 = 418

### Step 2: Propose Initial Allocation
- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 the most, so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

### Step 3: Continue Allocation to Balance and Minimize Envy
- Allocate remaining items based on descending order of valuations, ensuring no agent feels significantly worse off.

### Proposed Fair Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 6, 7] - Total valuation = 72 + 16 + 14 = 102
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 5] - Total valuation = 46 + 80 + 85 = 211
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3] - Total valuation = 51 + 93 = 144

### Step 4: Final Check
- Ensure all 8 items are allocated and adjust if needed for balance.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a manner that respects the agents' preferences and minimizes envy, ensuring each agent receives a fair portion relative to their valuations.
