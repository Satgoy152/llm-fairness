Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  16  13  19  80  77  12  19
1  20  82  93  34  59  11   7  26
2   2  72  90  90  74  18   0  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Evaluate Total Valuation:**
   - Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their overall preferences.
   
2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start with a simple allocation where each agent gets some items based on their highest valuations to minimize envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Check if any agent envies another's allocation and adjust the allocation if possible to reduce or eliminate envy.

4. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - Make sure that all items are allocated and that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

### Calculations:

**Agent Valuations for all items:**

- Agent 0: 95, 16, 13, 19, 80, 77, 12, 19
- Agent 1: 20, 82, 93, 34, 59, 11, 7, 26
- Agent 2: 2, 72, 90, 90, 74, 18, 0, 90

**Total Valuations:**

- Agent 0: 331
- Agent 1: 332
- Agent 2: 436

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets items they value highest: 0 (95), 4 (80)
   - Agent 1 gets items they value highest: 2 (93), 1 (82)
   - Agent 2 gets items they value highest: 3 (90), 7 (90)

2. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: 5, 6
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is 5 (77)
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is 3 (34) but it's taken, so Agent 0 gets 5 (77)
   - Agent 1 gets 6 (7) as it is the remaining option.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance fairness by giving each agent items they highly value, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Adjustments were made to ensure no agent has a strong reason to envy another's allocation, based on their own valuations.
