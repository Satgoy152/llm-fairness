Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  38  22  96  89  81   8  37
1  40  34  75  74  73  21  73  88
2  27  24  82  64   1  27  83  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 34 75 74 73 21 73 88]
 [27 24 82 64  1 27 83 46]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 8 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an approximate envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel they have received at least as good a bundle as any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the valuations given in the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  38  22  96  89  81   8  37
1  40  34  75  74  73  21  73  88
2  27  24  82  64   1  27  83  46
```

We'll try to allocate items such that each agent feels they have a substantial share of items according to their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, and 4
  - Valuations: 84 + 96 + 89 = 269
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 6, and 7
  - Valuations: 75 + 73 + 88 = 236
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 5
  - Valuations: 24 + 27 = 51

This allocation takes into account the highest valuations for each agent and ensures all items are distributed while trying to balance the perceived value among the agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation is a balanced attempt to ensure fairness based on the given valuations.
