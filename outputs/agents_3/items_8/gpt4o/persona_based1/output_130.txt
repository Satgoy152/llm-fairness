Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  37   3  86  31  29  35   3
1  88  35  84  99  19  95  21  19
2  50  91  18  11  13  94  60  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents, one approach is to attempt to minimize envy by considering the agents' valuations of the items. A common method is to use the "maximum Nash welfare" criterion, which seeks to allocate items so that the product of the agents' utilities (valuations of items they receive) is maximized. This often results in an envy-free allocation or the closest practical approximation thereof.

Let's compute an allocation that attempts to be fair and minimizes envy:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (88), 3 (86)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (99), 2 (84), 5 (95)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (94), 1 (91)

With these preferences in mind, we can attempt an allocation:

- **Agent 1** highly values item 3, so we assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 5 and 1, so we assign items 5 and 1 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** highly values item 0, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Continuing with the allocation process:

- **Agent 1** also values item 2 highly (84), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** can be assigned item 4 (31), which is higher in value to Agent 0 compared to its value to others.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 (60) more than the others, so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** can be assigned item 7 (3) as a leftover.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the preferences and values of each agent, aiming to minimize envy where possible.
