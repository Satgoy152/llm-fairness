Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  48  58  44   0  36  19  42
1  53  78  83  74   2  95   3  93
2  60  48  80   6  82  30   8  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that no agent envies another's bundle of allocated items. This involves considering both the total value each agent assigns to the items they receive and the distribution of items among agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent**: We need to look at which items are highly valued by each agent. This will help us ensure that each agent receives their most preferred items, reducing the likelihood of envy.

2. **Allocate items based on preferences**: Start by assigning the items where agents have the highest individual valuations compared to others. This can help to ensure that each agent gets at least some of their most preferred items.

3. **Balance the total value among agents**: After initial allocations based on preferences, adjust to ensure that the total value across agents is balanced to the extent possible.

Let's perform this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest (58). Also values items 0 (56) and 1 (48).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest (95). Also values items 2 (83), 1 (78), and 7 (93).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (82). Also values items 2 (80) and 7 (75).

**Allocation Plan:**

1. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1**: Highest value for Agent 1.
2. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2**: Highest value for Agent 2.
3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Second highest value for Agent 1.
4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Highest value for Agent 0.
5. **Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2**: High value for Agent 2.
6. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Third highest value for Agent 1.
7. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Remaining item for Agent 0.
8. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0**: Low value items, but to balance the count.

This allocation balances the items and attempts to provide each agent with their preferred items.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide agents with items they value highly and balances the distribution of item counts.
