Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  12   6  15  71  16  30  52
1  27  52  18  64  63   6  81  91
2  80  51  52  84   7  55  99  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use an iterative method, such as the adjusted winner procedure or a similar fair division algorithm, to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Given the valuations, we can approach this problem by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations and ensuring each agent gets their fair share considering their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 very highly (71), so we can give them item 4.
- Agent 1 values items 6 (81) and 7 (91) highly, so we allocate these two items to them.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (99), but since it's already allocated, we give them item 3 (84) which is their next highest valuation.

Continuing in this manner, we ensure that each agent receives items such that total valuations are as balanced as possible given the constraints:

- Agent 0: [0, 4] (total valuation = 57 + 71 = 128)
- Agent 1: [6, 7] (total valuation = 81 + 91 = 172)
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 3, 5] (total valuation = 51 + 52 + 84 + 55 = 242)

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
