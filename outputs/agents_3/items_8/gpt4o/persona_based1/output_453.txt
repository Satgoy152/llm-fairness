Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  44  43  10  36  10  63  42
1  59  99  25  35   1  26  45  25
2  54  63  85  44   4  49  85  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness as a guiding principle. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible. One approach is to iteratively assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the minimum value each agent perceives for their allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Get items 0, 7
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 31 (item 0) + 42 (item 7) = 73

2. **Agent 1:** Get items 1, 5
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 99 (item 1) + 26 (item 5) = 125

3. **Agent 2:** Get items 2, 3, 4, 6
   - Total value for Agent 2 = 85 (item 2) + 44 (item 3) + 4 (item 4) + 85 (item 6) = 218

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived total values among agents, considering their individual valuations. Although perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable due to discrete item distribution, this approach tries to minimize potential envy among agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
