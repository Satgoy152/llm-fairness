Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  63  32  68  67  59  96  77
1  48  53  99  15  91  56  12  65
2  98  52  50  49  49  72  77  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 63 32 68 67 59 96 77]
 [48 53 99 15 91 56 12 65]
 [98 52 50 49 49 72 77 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocations of the other agents.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  63  32  68  67  59  96  77
1  48  53  99  15  91  56  12  65
2  98  52  50  49  49  72  77  29
```

Let's proceed with a strategic allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with the highest valuations for Agent 0. Items 6 and 7 have the highest values (96 and 77). Allocate items 6 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** Next, prioritize items for Agent 1. Item 2 has the highest value (99), followed by item 4 (91). Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Allocate the remaining items to Agent 2. Items 0, 5, and 3 are left. Agent 2 values these items at 98, 72, and 49, respectively. Allocate items 0, 5, and 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Check:** Verify the total number of items allocated:
   - Agent 0: Items 6 and 7 (2 items)
   - Agent 1: Items 2 and 4 (2 items)
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 5, and 3 (3 items)

We still have one item left (item 1). Let's assign it to the agent who values it the most and has the least value in their allocation.

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 at 63. Current allocation value = 96 + 77 = 173.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 at 53. Current allocation value = 99 + 91 = 190.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 1 at 52. Current allocation value = 98 + 72 + 49 = 219.

Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as this keeps the distribution of total values closer.

Now, let's represent the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has a fair share based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
