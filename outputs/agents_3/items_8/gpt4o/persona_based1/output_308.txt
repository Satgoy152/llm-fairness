Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  94  28  92  37  96  45  20
1  68  66  84  97  66  87  68  82
2  26  49  51  16  62   3  22  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [99, 94, 28, 92, 37, 96, 45, 20]
- Agent 1 values: [68, 66, 84, 97, 66, 87, 68, 82]
- Agent 2 values: [26, 49, 51, 16, 62, 3, 22, 94]

A potential approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum envy-free allocation" or "approximate envy-free allocation" where we try to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly.

Let's try the allocation in the following manner:

1. Allocate items to maximize satisfaction for each agent, ensuring no agent feels envious of another.

Allocating items:

- Start by allocating items with the highest valuations for each agent:

  - Agent 0 highly values items: 0 (99), 1 (94), 5 (96)
  - Agent 1 highly values items: 3 (97), 5 (87), 2 (84)
  - Agent 2 highly values items: 7 (94), 4 (62), 2 (51)

- Distribute items trying to balance high valuations and coverage:

  - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 99)
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 97)
  - Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value 94)

- Continue to allocate remaining items by checking the next highest available valuations ensuring each agent gets at least 2 items:

  - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 96)
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 68)
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 62)
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 94)
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 84)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 1],
    "1": [3, 6, 2],
    "2": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent should feel envious of another given the high-value items they have received.
