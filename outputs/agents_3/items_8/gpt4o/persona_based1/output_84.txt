Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  19  56  95  31  77  90  21
1  53  91  80   2   6  44  91  43
2  85  88  86   0  83  71  59  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This means that we want each agent to receive items such that their perceived value isn't less than what they perceive the other agents to have received. We also want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of all items.

First, we calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 62 + 19 + 56 + 95 + 31 + 77 + 90 + 21 = 451
- Agent 1's total value: 53 + 91 + 80 + 2 + 6 + 44 + 91 + 43 = 410
- Agent 2's total value: 85 + 88 + 86 + 0 + 83 + 71 + 59 + 50 = 522

The total value of all items from all agents' perspectives is different, but we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items they value as close as possible to their fair share of the total value. 

Next, we begin allocating items:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest total valuation and should prefer items with high values from their perspective, such as items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly and should receive it.
3. **Agent 1** values items 1 and 6 highly and should receive them.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3, as it gives them a high value.
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 7, which provide a moderate value.
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 2, and 4, as they have the highest value for them.

Re-evaluate and distribute to ensure fairness and total allocation:

- Assign items 0, 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 2.
- Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Items 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
