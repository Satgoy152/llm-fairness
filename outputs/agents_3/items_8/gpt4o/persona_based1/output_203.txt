Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  10  77  74  83  54  25  56
1  37  54  70  42  99  54  27  28
2  78  76  73  74  61  64  93  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 54 70 42 99 54 27 28]
 [78 76 73 74 61 64 93 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities (valuations) for each agent. This ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their own preferences.

Let's first sum up the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 15 + 10 + 77 + 74 + 83 + 54 + 25 + 56 = 394
- Agent 1: 37 + 54 + 70 + 42 + 99 + 54 + 27 + 28 = 411
- Agent 2: 78 + 76 + 73 + 74 + 61 + 64 + 93 + 56 = 575

Now, let's aim to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a share close to their proportion of the total valuation. The total valuation across all agents is 394 + 411 + 575 = 1380.

Now, we allocate items trying to maximize each agent's happiness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations (descending order): 83 (item 4), 77 (item 2), 74 (item 3), 56 (item 7), 54 (item 5), 25 (item 6), 15 (item 0), 10 (item 1)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations (descending order): 99 (item 4), 70 (item 2), 54 (items 1 and 5), 42 (item 3), 37 (item 0), 28 (item 7), 27 (item 6)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations (descending order): 93 (item 6), 78 (item 0), 76 (item 1), 74 (item 3), 73 (item 2), 64 (item 5), 61 (item 4), 56 (item 7)

Let's try to allocate items prioritizing higher valuations:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 99 for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 93 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 77 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 74 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 78 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 54 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 76 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value 28 for Agent 1).

This allocation attempts to maximize the happiness for each agent given their preferences. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6, 0, 1]
}
```
