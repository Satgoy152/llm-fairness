Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  51  52  92  62  26   2  72
1  37  75  37  37  57  45  55  90
2   2  44  36  61  87   7  79  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2 44 36 61 87  7 79 84]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 8 items among the 3 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. This means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We can use a simple algorithm to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total value from their assigned items.

Let's first consider the total value each agent can obtain:

- Agent 0's valuations: [64, 51, 52, 92, 62, 26, 2, 72]
- Agent 1's valuations: [37, 75, 37, 37, 57, 45, 55, 90]
- Agent 2's valuations: [2, 44, 36, 61, 87, 7, 79, 84]

We will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness. An initial approach could be to allocate items to the agent who values them the most.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (64).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (75).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (52).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (92).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most (87).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (45).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (79).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most (84).

Now let's check the allocations and adjust if necessary to maintain fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3] with total value = 64 + 52 + 92 = 208
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5] with total value = 75 + 45 = 120
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6, 7] with total value = 87 + 79 + 84 = 250

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items, and each item is given to an agent who values it highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
