Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  94  74  99  57  56  62  99
1  50  54  75  17  61  35  14  14
2  48  25  82  48  32  97   3  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 94 74 99 57 56 62 99]
 [50 54 75 17 61 35 14 14]
 [48 25 82 48 32 97  3 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated equals 8, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. We aim to allocate items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

To approach this problem, we first observe the valuations table:

```
Agent 0: [72, 94, 74, 99, 57, 56, 62, 99]
Agent 1: [50, 54, 75, 17, 61, 35, 14, 14]
Agent 2: [48, 25, 82, 48, 32, 97, 3, 26]
```

Let's start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy. A practical approach is to use a round-robin method based on each agent's highest preferences.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 3 and 7 (value 99 each). To avoid envy, we can give Agent 0 one of these items.

2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 75). We can allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 97). We can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's continue allocating the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (value 94). We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 0** also has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (value 72), which is not highly valued by the others. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1** has a decent valuation for item 4 (value 61), so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.

7. **Agent 1** can also take item 6 (value 14) since it is not highly valued by the others, and it ensures Agent 1 gets a fair share.

8. **Agent 2** can take item 3 (value 48), which balances the allocation and ensures all items are allocated.

The resulting allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by considering the highest preferences of each agent and attempts to distribute the items fairly among them.
