Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  84  49  65  89  49  97  62
1  25  25   9  34  90  77  97  41
2  21  98  21  54  76  46  83  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 84 49 65 89 49 97 62]
 [25 25  9 34 90 77 97 41]
 [21 98 21 54 76 46 83 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, or as close to it as possible. One commonly used method for achieving a fair division in such problems is the "round-robin" or "sequential" allocation, where each agent picks their most valued item in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agents' valuations for items:
Agent 0: [33, 84, 49, 65, 89, 49, 97, 62]
Agent 1: [25, 25,  9, 34, 90, 77, 97, 41]
Agent 2: [21, 98, 21, 54, 76, 46, 83, 77]
```

We proceed with the allocation:

1. **First Round:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 6 (value 97)
   - Agent 1 takes item 4 (value 90)
   - Agent 2 takes item 1 (value 98)

2. **Second Round:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 4 (value 89) [since item 4 is already taken, next highest is item 1 (value 84)]
   - Agent 1 takes item 5 (value 77)
   - Agent 2 takes item 7 (value 77)

3. **Third Round:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 3 (value 65)
   - Agent 1 takes item 7 (value 41) [since item 7 is already taken, next highest is item 3 (value 34)]
   - Agent 2 takes item 0 (value 21)

4. **Final Assignment:**
   - Remaining items for Agent 1 are item 2 (value 9) and item 5 (value 77) [But since item 5 is already taken, next highest is item 2 (value 9)]

After this allocation, let's ensure every item has been assigned:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: [6, 1, 3]
- Items allocated to Agent 1: [4, 5, 2]
- Items allocated to Agent 2: [7, 0]

The final JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 2],
    "2": [7, 0]
}
```
