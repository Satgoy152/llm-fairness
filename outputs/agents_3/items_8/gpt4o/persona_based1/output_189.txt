Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  97  19  58  53  36  26  96
1   6  40  45  20  68   9  70  65
2  64   5   7  86  61  67  67  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64  5  7 86 61 67 67 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives from their allocated bundle of items. This approach aims to ensure that no agent envies another by prioritizing fairness based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [47, 97, 19, 58, 53, 36, 26, 96]
- Agent 1 values: [6, 40, 45, 20, 68, 9, 70, 65]
- Agent 2 values: [64, 5, 7, 86, 61, 67, 67, 85]

We will allocate items to maximize the minimum satisfaction each agent receives. We can use a simple algorithmic approach to assign items based on maximizing individual utilities while ensuring that each agent feels they are fairly treated according to their preferences.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Assignment:**
   - Each agent picks their most valued available item.

2. **Redistribute to Balance:**
   - After initial allocation, redistribute to ensure fairness by examining if switching any items between agents will increase the overall fairness.

3. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure that all items are distributed and each agent has at least one item to prevent envy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 takes item 1 (value 97).
   - Agent 1 takes item 4 (value 68).
   - Agent 2 takes item 3 (value 86).

2. **Allocate Remaining Items Considering Fairness:**
   - Agent 0 also takes item 7 (value 96).
   - Agent 1 also takes items 6 (value 70) and 2 (value 45).
   - Agent 2 takes items 0 (value 64) and 5 (value 67).

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated and that no agent envies another.

Given the above process, the final allocation ensuring fairness and minimizing envy is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers the maximum value each agent can get while ensuring that each agent has a fair share of the items according to their valuations.
