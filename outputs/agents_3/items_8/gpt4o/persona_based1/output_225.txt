Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  44  31  93  51  11  71  82
1  75  14  27  68  77  56  92  32
2  94   7  39  81  24  22  45  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuations of the items. One approach is to use an envy-free algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure or the round-robin method. However, since this is a small problem, a manual inspection and allocation can be done to ensure fairness.

Let's start by analyzing the valuation matrix for each agent:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as 40, 44, 31, 93, 51, 11, 71, 82 respectively.

- Agent 1 values:
  - Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as 75, 14, 27, 68, 77, 56, 92, 32 respectively.

- Agent 2 values:
  - Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as 94, 7, 39, 81, 24, 22, 45, 20 respectively.

A fair division approach is to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets items they value highly while minimizing envy.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Allocate items 3 and 7. (High values: 93, 82)

2. Agent 1:
   - Allocate items 0 and 6. (High values: 75, 92)

3. Agent 2:
   - Allocate items 2, 4, 5, and 1. (Values: 39, 24, 22, 7)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 1]
}
```
