Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  55  42  19  77   6  33   5
1  34  89  26  64  59  80   1   7
2  74  60  80   2  60  68  42  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent perceives they have received a fair share. One common method is to use the Envy-Free (EF) criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, a potential allocation strategy is to ensure that each agent receives items whose total value is as balanced as possible relative to their valuations. Here is a possible allocation based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 1, 4, and 5.
- **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 7.

A potential allocation is:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (decent valuation and balancing need).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (decent valuation and balancing need).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent perceives they have received:

Agent 0: 4, 6
Agent 1: 1, 3, 5
Agent 2: 0, 2, 7

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
