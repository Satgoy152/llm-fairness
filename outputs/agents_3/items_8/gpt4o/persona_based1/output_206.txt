Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  26   8  77  53   3  64  58
1  82  93  28  75  96   4   2  44
2  16  90  77  70  23  10  72  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. However, given the constraints of integer allocations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be feasible. Instead, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's perceived value from their allocation is maximized, and potential envy is minimized.

To begin, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 35 + 26 + 8 + 77 + 53 + 3 + 64 + 58 = 324
- Agent 1's total valuation: 82 + 93 + 28 + 75 + 96 + 4 + 2 + 44 = 424
- Agent 2's total valuation: 16 + 90 + 77 + 70 + 23 + 10 + 72 + 46 = 404

One approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations to minimize envy and maximize individual satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest values first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to avoid complete allocation envy.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (77), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (96), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (90), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Next, consider the remaining items and distribute them to balance perceived fairness:

- Agent 0: Consider items 6 (64) and 7 (58).
- Agent 1: Consider items 0 (82) and 2 (28).
- Agent 2: Consider items 5 (10) and 2 (77).

Final allocation based on maximizing individual satisfaction:

- Agent 0: [3, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [4, 0, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while distributing items fairly. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [4, 0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the condition of distributing all 8 items among the agents and attempts to minimize envy by maximizing the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences.
