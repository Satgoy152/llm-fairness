Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  72  30  74  56  64  52  86
1  31  17  49  90  40  77   5  29
2  90  31  45  59  72  89  44  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we must consider each agent's preferences and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-free allocation is challenging, especially with arbitrary valuations, but we can try to make the distribution as fair as possible given the constraints. 

Let's start by analyzing the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [1, 72, 30, 74, 56, 64, 52, 86]
Agent 1: [31, 17, 49, 90, 40, 77, 5, 29]
Agent 2: [90, 31, 45, 59, 72, 89, 44, 25]
```

We aim to allocate all 8 items among the 3 agents such that each agent receives some items, and the total number of items allocated equals 8. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by giving each agent the item they value the most.
2. Continue by assigning remaining items to agents such that their total valuations are as balanced as possible.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Values item 7 the highest (86), so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 3 the highest (90), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 0 the highest (90), so assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Next, allocate remaining items to balance valuations:

- **Remaining items:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

Continuing with remaining items:

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 5 (64) and item 6 (52) to Agent 0 (next highest valued items for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 4 (40) to Agent 1 (next highest valued item for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 1 (31) and item 2 (45) to Agent 2 (next highest valued items for Agent 2).

This results in the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 7, 5, 6
- **Agent 1:** Items 3, 4
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 1, 2

This allocation is an attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives while respecting their individual preferences. It may not be entirely envy-free, but it's a step towards minimizing envy.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with an emphasis on balancing each agent's valuation of their assigned items.
