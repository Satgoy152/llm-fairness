Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  27  80  38  12  59  65  91
1  46  29   5  69   8   2  55   8
2  65  31  77  93  53   1  43   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent perceives their allocation to be fair based on their valuations. One commonly used approach is to use the concept of maximin share (MMS), where each agent should receive at least as much value as they would if they divided the items themselves into equal parts and received the least valuable part.

First, let's calculate the total value for each agent and determine a fair share:

- Agent 0's total value: 60 + 27 + 80 + 38 + 12 + 59 + 65 + 91 = 432
- Agent 1's total value: 46 + 29 + 5 + 69 + 8 + 2 + 55 + 8 = 222
- Agent 2's total value: 65 + 31 + 77 + 93 + 53 + 1 + 43 + 1 = 364

Each agent should ideally receive at least:

- Agent 0's fair share: 432 / 3 = 144
- Agent 1's fair share: 222 / 3 = 74
- Agent 2's fair share: 364 / 3 = 121

Now, let's aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets close to or exceeds their fair share while accounting for integer allocation of items.

Let's consider the allocation:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (80), item 7 (91), and item 0 (60).
   - Allocate items [2, 7, 0] to Agent 0.

2. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (69), followed by item 6 (55).
   - Allocate items [3, 6] to Agent 1.

3. Allocate items to Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (93), but it is already allocated.
   - Allocate items [4, 5, 1] to Agent 2, which are the next most valuable remaining items for Agent 2.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0's total value: 80 (item 2) + 91 (item 7) + 60 (item 0) = 231
- Agent 1's total value: 69 (item 3) + 55 (item 6) = 124
- Agent 2's total value: 53 (item 4) + 1 (item 5) + 31 (item 1) = 85

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensures each agent gets items that maximize their valuation.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 1]
}
```
