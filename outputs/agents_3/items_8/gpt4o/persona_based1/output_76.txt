Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  46  74   9  53  12  79   4
1  97  64  74  75  42  90  33  75
2  74  65  58  38  38  52  64  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 64 74 75 42 90 33 75]
 [74 65 58 38 38 52 64 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that satisfies envy-freeness as much as possible. One common approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Maximum Nash Welfare" to distribute the items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [50, 46, 74, 9, 53, 12, 79, 4]
- Agent 1: [97, 64, 74, 75, 42, 90, 33, 75]
- Agent 2: [74, 65, 58, 38, 38, 52, 64, 44]

We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items according to their preferences, balancing the total perceived value each agent receives.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most.
3. **Agent 2** has several moderately high valuations but not as many extreme ones, so we should aim to balance their total value with the others.

### Steps:
- Assign items with the highest individual valuations to the respective agents.
- Balance the remaining items to ensure a fair distribution of total perceived values.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 (value 79, highest for Agent 0) and item 2 (another high value).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (value 97, highest for Agent 1) and item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1, 3, 4, and 7, as they collectively provide a balanced total value.

### Final Allocation:
Here is the distribution in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with a focus on minimizing envy among the agents.
