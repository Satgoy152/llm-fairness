Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  59  91  50  51  54  22  43
1  53  83  32   7  12   3  77  59
2   8  34  86  71  21  52  80  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item (EF1)" criterion, which ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from another agent's bundle.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-valued Items for Each Agent**: We look at the most highly valued items for each agent and aim to allocate them first if possible.

2. **Iterative Allocation**: Distribute the items iteratively, checking at each step that the allocation is as fair as possible according to the EF1 criterion.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

By analyzing the table:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (91) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (83) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 (80) highly.

Given these considerations, we can make an initial allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Next, we allocate the remaining items, balancing the total value for each agent as closely as possible:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 23 for Agent 0, which pairs well with item 2).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 59 for Agent 1, which provides a good balance with item 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 71 for Agent 2, which is significant).

Now, only items 4 and 5 remain:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 54 for Agent 0, which complements their current allocation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 12 for Agent 1, balancing their allocation).

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy among agents while ensuring each agent receives items according to their valuations.
