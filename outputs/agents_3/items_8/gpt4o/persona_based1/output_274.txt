Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  95  71  38   7   0  57   3
1   7  85  55   5  27  60  13  26
2  76  73  86  18  31  22  78  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 85 55  5 27 60 13 26]
 [76 73 86 18 31 22 78 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. A common approach to ensuring fairness is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

```
0: [4, 95, 71, 38, 7, 0, 57, 3]
1: [7, 85, 55, 5, 27, 60, 13, 26]
2: [76, 73, 86, 18, 31, 22, 78, 17]
```

Let's try to find an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations while keeping the allocation as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Initial High-Value Allocation:** Start by trying to allocate the items that have the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.
2. **Balancing:** Adjust the allocation to balance the total value each agent receives, reducing the potential for envy.

### Steps:

1. **Item 2 (86), Item 6 (78), Item 0 (76):** Assign to Agent 2 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
2. **Item 1 (95):** Assign to Agent 0 because they value it the highest.
3. **Item 5 (60):** Assign to Agent 1 because they value it the highest after Agent 2.
4. **Item 3 (38):** Assign to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than others.
5. **Item 4 (31):** Assign to Agent 2 because they value it more than others.
6. **Item 7 (26):** Assign to Agent 1 because they value it more than others.

### Final Allocation:

Now, based on these decisions, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 5, 7
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 2, 4, 6

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the perceived value for each agent while keeping the distribution as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.
