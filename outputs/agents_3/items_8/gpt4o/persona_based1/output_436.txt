Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  18  65  17  14  84  47  75
1  84  63  32  81  10   6   7  74
2  30   4  64  17  67  84  65  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible according to the valuations provided. One common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - High: Items 2 (65), 5 (84), 7 (75)
  - Medium: Items 0 (52), 6 (47)
  - Low: Items 1 (18), 3 (17), 4 (14)

- Agent 1 values:
  - High: Items 0 (84), 3 (81), 7 (74)
  - Medium: Items 1 (63), 2 (32)
  - Low: Items 4 (10), 5 (6), 6 (7)

- Agent 2 values:
  - High: Items 5 (84), 7 (90)
  - Medium: Items 2 (64), 4 (67), 6 (65)
  - Low: Items 0 (30), 1 (4), 3 (17)

We'll try to distribute the items to achieve as much fairness as possible:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2, 5, and 7. We can give Agent 0 items 5 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 3. We can give Agent 1 items 0 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 7 and 5. Since item 5 is already given to Agent 0, we give item 7 to Agent 2.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items (1, 4, 6):

- Item 1: Best allocated to Agent 1, as they value it more than other agents.
- Item 4: Best allocated to Agent 2, as they value it more than other agents.
- Item 6: Best allocated to Agent 2, as they value it more than other agents.

Finally, let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value more compared to the others, aiming for a fair distribution with respect to their valuations.
