Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  24  35  96  66  82   7  49
1  94  96  27  51  40  80  48  34
2  19  90  99  34  30  12   9  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [19 90 99 34 30 12  9 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the maximin share (MMS) concept. The MMS for an agent is the largest value that they can ensure for themselves when items are divided into bundles equal to the number of agents.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 3 + 24 + 35 + 96 + 66 + 82 + 7 + 49 = 362
- Agent 1: 94 + 96 + 27 + 51 + 40 + 80 + 48 + 34 = 470
- Agent 2: 19 + 90 + 99 + 34 + 30 + 12 + 9 + 64 = 357

The fair share for each agent is the total value divided by the number of agents:

- Fair share for Agent 0 = 362 / 3 ≈ 120.67
- Fair share for Agent 1 = 470 / 3 ≈ 156.67
- Fair share for Agent 2 = 357 / 3 ≈ 119

Now, we attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets at least their fair share value while ensuring the number of items per agent is integer, and all items are allocated.

Let's start allocating the items:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest total valuation and fair share. We'll allocate items to Agent 1 first:
   - Allocate item 1 (96), item 5 (80) which sums to 176.
   - Total: 176 (satisfies fair share of 156.67)

2. **Agent 0** has the second highest total valuation:
   - Allocate item 3 (96), item 4 (66) which sums to 162.
   - Total: 162 (satisfies fair share of 120.67)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 2 (99), item 7 (64), item 0 (19), item 6 (9) which sums to 191.
   - Total: 191 (satisfies fair share of 119)

Each agent is allocated items such that they receive at least their fair share of the total valuation.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 0, 6]
}
```
