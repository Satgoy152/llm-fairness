Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10   2  31  84  87  42  61   0
1  77  86  23   2   1  85   7  21
2  60  49  45  10   7  58  39  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we will use an approach that considers each agent's preferences and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's first examine the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [10, 2, 31, 84, 87, 42, 61, 0]
- Agent 1: [77, 86, 23, 2, 1, 85, 7, 21]
- Agent 2: [60, 49, 45, 10, 7, 58, 39, 48]

One common method for fair division is to employ a "round-robin" or "sequential picking" approach, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. This method can be adjusted to take into account the relative valuations to try and minimize envy.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 87).
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 86).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 58).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 84).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 77).
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 45).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 61).
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 21).
   - No items left for Agent 2, but they have already picked two items in line with others.

The allocations aim to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences. The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 0, 7],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
