Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  96  48  26  49  11  57  70
1  12  97  86  26  24  96  55  14
2   1  29  19  96  76  88  83  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a satisfactory share of the items based on their valuations. Our goal is to achieve a distribution that is as envy-free as possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own given their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 1 and 5 highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 3, 4, 5, and 7 highly.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign items with the highest individual valuations to the respective agents:
     - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 92).
     - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 97).
     - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 96).

3. **Continue Allocation Based on Remaining High-Value Items:**
   - Assign additional items to balance the distribution, considering remaining high-value items:
     - Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 48).
     - Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 96).
     - Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 93).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute the remaining items while considering fairness:
     - Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 57).
     - Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 76).

5. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair share based on their individual valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
