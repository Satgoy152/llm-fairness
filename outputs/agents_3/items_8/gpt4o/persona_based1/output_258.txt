Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  48  98  88  38  92  40  73
1  76  86  70  39  85  38  65  60
2  62  93  82  54  18  87  85  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 86 70 39 85 38 65 60]
 [62 93 82 54 18 87 85 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. The valuations for each agent and item are given, and we need to assign all 8 items.

Let's summarize the values for each agent:

- Agent 0: [54, 48, 98, 88, 38, 92, 40, 73]
- Agent 1: [76, 86, 70, 39, 85, 38, 65, 60]
- Agent 2: [62, 93, 82, 54, 18, 87, 85, 62]

We can use the following strategy to ensure a fair distribution of items:

1. Each agent should receive a relatively equivalent total valuation for the items they receive.
2. Try to minimize the potential for envy by maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive, given the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Choose item 2 (value: 98)
   - Choose item 5 (value: 92)
   - Total value for Agent 0: 98 + 92 = 190

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Choose item 1 (value: 86)
   - Choose item 4 (value: 85)
   - Choose item 6 (value: 65)
   - Total value for Agent 1: 86 + 85 + 65 = 236

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Choose item 0 (value: 62)
   - Choose item 3 (value: 54)
   - Choose item 7 (value: 62)
   - Total value for Agent 2: 62 + 54 + 62 = 178

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while considering their preferences. The total number of items allocated is 8. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
