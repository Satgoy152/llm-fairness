Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  31  17  88  87  31  14  96
1  54  23  70  17  70  92  51  54
2  78  84  41  62  59  37   0  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with an allocation strategy to ensure fairness and minimize envy. A common approach is to assign items in a way that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that the total value received by each agent is balanced.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 10 + 31 + 17 + 88 + 87 + 31 + 14 + 96 = 374
- Agent 1: 54 + 23 + 70 + 17 + 70 + 92 + 51 + 54 = 431
- Agent 2: 78 + 84 + 41 + 62 + 59 + 37 + 0 + 95 = 456

Now, let's distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the most, followed by item 3.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most, followed by items 2 and 4.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most, followed by items 7 and 0.

Letâ€™s try to allocate items to balance the total value received by each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items 3 and 7 to Agent 0.  
  - Valuation: 88 (for item 3) + 96 (for item 7) = 184

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.
  - Valuation: 70 (for item 2) + 70 (for item 4) + 92 (for item 5) = 232

- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0, 1, and 6 to Agent 2.
  - Valuation: 78 (for item 0) + 84 (for item 1) + 0 (for item 6) = 162

The allocations balance the total values each agent receives given their preferences. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value, while keeping the total valuations relatively balanced among the agents.
