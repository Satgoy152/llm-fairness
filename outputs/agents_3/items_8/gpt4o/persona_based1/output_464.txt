Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  43  53  40  28  38  70  34
1  46  82   2  70  72  95  74  60
2  22   5  69  99  11   3  51  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which suggests that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or another algorithm designed to minimize envy. However, given that we're working with a specific set of valuations, we can manually try to allocate items in a way that seems fair based on these values.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (70) and a relatively high valuation for item 0 (63). Assigning these two items to agent 0 seems reasonable.

2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (95) and item 1 (82). Assigning these two items to agent 1 is a good start.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99) and a relatively high valuation for item 2 (69). Assigning these two items to agent 2 is sensible.

We now have 2 items left to assign: items 4 and 7.

- **Agent 1** has a fairly high valuation for item 4 (72), which is higher than the valuations of agents 0 and 2. Therefore, we assign item 4 to agent 1.

- **Agent 0** has a relatively high valuation for item 7 (34) compared to agents 1 and 2. Thus, we assign item 7 to agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3.

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
