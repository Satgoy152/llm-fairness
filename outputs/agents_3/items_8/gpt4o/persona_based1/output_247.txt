Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  50  65  71  48  17  75  23
1  33  17  75  77  44  40  56  13
2  78   1  58  27  50  70  19  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we want to consider a distribution that minimizes envy, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation if possible. We will start by examining the valuations to see if we can allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [42, 50, 65, 71, 48, 17, 75, 23]
- Agent 1: [33, 17, 75, 77, 44, 40, 56, 13]
- Agent 2: [78, 1, 58, 27, 50, 70, 19, 56]

To aim for an envy-free allocation, we'll try to give each agent the items they value most, while ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items. We'll consider each agent's highest-value items and avoid overlap when possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value 75), item 3 second most (value 71), and item 2 third most (value 65).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 77), item 2 second most (value 75), and item 6 third most (value 56).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value 78), item 5 second most (value 70), and item 4 third most (value 50).

Based on these observations, here's a proposed allocation:

- Assign items to match high valuations and avoid overlap:
  - Agent 0: [6, 2, 1]
  - Agent 1: [3, 4]
  - Agent 2: [0, 5, 7]

This allocation respects each agent's high-value preferences and ensures that all items are allocated:

```
{
    "0": [6, 2, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This distribution is designed to minimize potential envy by ensuring that each agent receives at least some of their highest-valued items.
