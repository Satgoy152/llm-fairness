Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  89  98  91  85  40   8   1
1   6  23  21   4  40  52  68   5
2  23  67  13  18  91  75  14  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 67 13 18 91 75 14 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their individual valuations.

Here is a possible allocation that aims for fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation for items 1, 2, and 3, these should be allocated to them to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: They have a relatively high valuation for items 5 and 6. Allocating these items to Agent 1 will keep their valuation high.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 4 and item 7 highly, so those should go to them.

Let's consider the allocations based on the heuristic above:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 7

Now, let's check the total allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [5, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 4, 7]

This ensures all 8 items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
