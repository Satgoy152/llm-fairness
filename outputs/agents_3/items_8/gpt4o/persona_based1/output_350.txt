Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58   7  20   8  33   0  47  50
1  83  59  10  40  21  80  84  37
2  19  76  75  69   2   8  67  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 76 75 69  2  8 67 63]]
Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we'll aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. We'll try to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation.

First, let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: \(58 + 7 + 20 + 8 + 33 + 0 + 47 + 50 = 223\)
- Agent 1: \(83 + 59 + 10 + 40 + 21 + 80 + 84 + 37 = 414\)
- Agent 2: \(19 + 76 + 75 + 69 + 2 + 8 + 67 + 63 = 379\)

Now, let's use a heuristic approach to allocate items such that we try to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 (58) and 7 (50).
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 (83), 5 (80), and 6 (84).
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 (76), 2 (75), 3 (69), and 6 (67).

Based on this, we can start with the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that are valuable to them but not highly contested.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items where they have significantly higher valuations.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items where they have relatively higher valuations than others.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0. 
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's perceived value while distributing items fairly.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly relative to the other agents, reducing the likelihood of envy.
