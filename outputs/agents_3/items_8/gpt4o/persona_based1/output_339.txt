Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  76  41  13   9   4  69  93
1  60  40  51   3  52  66  50   0
2  17  75   4  63  69  31  78  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 75  4 63 69 31 78 17]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their own valuations.

To achieve this, we will:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items.
2. Use this information to guide the allocation, trying to give each agent items that maximize their individual value while ensuring no envy.

Let's calculate the total values each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 77 + 76 + 41 + 13 + 9 + 4 + 69 + 93 = 382
- Agent 1: 60 + 40 + 51 + 3 + 52 + 66 + 50 + 0 = 322
- Agent 2: 17 + 75 + 4 + 63 + 69 + 31 + 78 + 17 = 354

Next, we proceed with an allocation strategy to ensure envy-freeness:

1. Start by assigning each agent their most valued items.
2. Continue assigning items, balancing between maximizing individual agent satisfaction and ensuring that each agent receives approximately a fair share based on their total valuations.

Allocation Steps:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (93), so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (66), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (78), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Next, assign the remaining items, ensuring each agent is getting their fair share:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 77).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 75).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 63).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 51).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 52).

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 6]

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent is receiving a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
