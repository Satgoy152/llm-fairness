Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  68   7  60   1  76  66  13
1  34  68  51   6  36   7  70  54
2  17   4  73  76  21  32  87  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we need to allocate the items in such a way that each agent is as satisfied as possible, given their valuations. A common approach in fair division is to prioritize items based on the highest valuations, assigning each item to the agent who values it most. We also need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value, to the extent possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 5 and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 1 and 6 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 6 and 3 highly.

Now, let's attempt to allocate items:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation (76).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation (68, tied with Agent 1, but Agent 0 already has item 5).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation (87).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they have the second-highest valuation (76).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation (73).
6. Assign item 7 to Agent 2, as they have the second-highest valuation (67).
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they have the second-highest valuation (34).
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest remaining valuation (36).

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 3, 6, and 7.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the agents' valuations while distributing the items fairly among them.
