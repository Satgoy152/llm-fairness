Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  57   7  91  51  21  74  61
1  55  96  71  34  45   0  20  40
2  86  95  97  74  64  91  78  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair relative to their valuations. One way to approach this is by attempting to satisfy envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 43     | 57     | 7      | 91     | 51     | 21     | 74     | 61     |
| 1     | 55     | 96     | 71     | 34     | 45     | 0      | 20     | 40     |
| 2     | 86     | 95     | 97     | 74     | 64     | 91     | 78     | 46     |

We will allocate the items by considering the highest valuations of agents for items and ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has high valuations for several items, but especially items 2 and 0. Allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for item 2, and second highest for item 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly, and no other agent values it more than Agent 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly, and no other agent values it more than Agent 0. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 2** also values item 5 highly. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

5. **Agent 2** values item 6 second highest after Agent 0, but since Agent 2 already has high value items, we allocate item 6 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

6. **Agent 0** values item 4 next. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 1** values item 7 more than Agent 0, so allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

Now, let's review the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 5

Each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, and the total number of allocated items is 8.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
