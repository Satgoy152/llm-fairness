Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  35  97  32  37  40  25  17
1  46  97  41  47  46  54  72  13
2  16  87  58  84  16   6  91  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items among the agents such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. This process can be complex, but let's attempt a reasonable allocation by considering the highest valued items for each agent and ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (97).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (91).

Given these preferences, we can start by allocating these high-value items to each agent. Then, we will proceed to distribute the remaining items while considering the next highest valuations for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets item 6.

2. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 next, which is already allocated, so the next highest is item 5 (40).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (46) next.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 (78) next.

3. **Continue with the next highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (37) next.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (47) next.
   - Agent 2 has no more items left to choose from since they have 3 items.

4. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Remaining items 0 and 3 are allocated to agents that value them next highest or have fewer items.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0, 3],
    "2": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent some of their higher-valued items while ensuring that every item is allocated. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible in every scenario, but this allocation seeks to minimize envy by respecting high valuations as much as possible.
