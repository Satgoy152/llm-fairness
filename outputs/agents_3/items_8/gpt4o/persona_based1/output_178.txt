Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  41  87  27  90  55  34   7
1  38  11  73  50  18   9  46  90
2  93  18  40  11  59  70  36  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate the items, taking into account the preferences of each agent.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations on items 4 (90), 2 (87), and 5 (55).
- Agent 1 has high valuations on items 7 (90), 2 (73), and 3 (50).
- Agent 2 has high valuations on items 0 (93), 5 (70), and 4 (59).

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their own allocation relative to their valuations. A common approach is to initially allocate items based on the highest individual valuations and then adjust to balance and minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign the highest-valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 90)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (value 90)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 93)

2. **Continue to allocate based on the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets more items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 87)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 is already taken, so next highest is Item 3 (value 50)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 70)

3. **Distribute remaining items while balancing the total number of items:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 6, 7
   - Agent 0: Assign Item 1 (value 41)
   - Agent 1: Assign Item 6 (value 46)
   - Agent 2: Assign Item 3 (value 11)

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 2, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [7, 3, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]

This allocation balances the items among the agents based on their preferences and ensures no agent envies another's allocation given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 1],
    "1": [7, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
