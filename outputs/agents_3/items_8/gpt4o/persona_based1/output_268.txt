Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  63   7  37  38  84  10  62
1   7   4  69  58  23  85   4  59
2  57  46  78   7  47  79  97  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 46 78  7 47 79 97 50]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent feels they have received a bundle of items that they value as much as possible, while also considering the valuations of other agents. One way to approach this is by utilizing the envy-freeness concept, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring no agent envies another. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.
2. Adjust allocations to prevent envy by swapping items if needed.

Based on the table, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for items 5 and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 highly values items 6 and 0.

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 receives items: 5, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 1
- Agent 2 receives items: 6, 0, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and attempts to balance the overall perceived value across agents.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 1],
    "2": [6, 0, 4]
}
```
