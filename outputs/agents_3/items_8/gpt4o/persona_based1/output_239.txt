Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  83  27  90  43  16  87  72
1  94  54  79  52  17  35  19  88
2   3  81  78  30  97   3  45   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 0 83 27 90 43 16 87 72]
 [94 54 79 52 17 35 19 88]
 [ 3 81 78 30 97  3 45  0]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall utility while attempting to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations from the table, we'll go through a process to allocate items to agents to maximize their satisfaction and minimize envy.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We can allocate items that have the highest relative value for Agent 0 compared to other agents.
   - Item 3: Value 90 (highest among all agents)
   - Item 1: Value 83 (also high value for Agent 0)
   - Item 6: Value 87 (highest among all agents)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that provide the highest satisfaction for Agent 1 compared to others.
   - Item 0: Value 94 (highest among all agents)
   - Item 7: Value 88 (highest among all agents)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate remaining items.
   - Item 4: Value 97 (highest among all agents)
   - Item 2: Value 78 (relatively high for Agent 2)
   - Item 5: Value 3 (shared low interest, but left over)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [4, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
