Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  81  92  56  91  75  41   6
1  16  57  57   4  15  80  53  79
2  91  20  27  79  88  95   2   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt a round-robin allocation based on the agents' preferences.

Let's first examine the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 52 + 81 + 92 + 56 + 91 + 75 + 41 + 6 = 494
- Agent 1's total valuation: 16 + 57 + 57 + 4 + 15 + 80 + 53 + 79 = 361
- Agent 2's total valuation: 91 + 20 + 27 + 79 + 88 + 95 + 2 + 1 = 403

Given the valuations, we can start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent in a round-robin manner:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest-valued items: 2 (92), 4 (91)
   - Allocation: [2, 4]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest-valued items: 5 (80), 7 (79)
   - Allocation: [5, 7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest-valued items: 5 (95), 0 (91)
   - Note: Item 5 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we choose the next highest available.
   - Allocation: [0]

Next, we continue allocating the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Next highest available: 3 (56)
  - Allocation: [2, 4, 3]

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Next highest available: 6 (53)
  - Allocation: [5, 7, 6]

- **Agent 2**:
  - Next highest available: 1 (20)
  - Allocation: [0, 1]

Now, all items have been allocated, and each agent has a number of items that aligns with their highest preferences as much as possible. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 3],
    "1": [5, 7, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be as envy-free as feasible given the constraints and preferences.
