Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  20  52  47  75  83  20  99
1   0  55  33  99   6  22  99  51
2  51  92  70  55  66  26  14  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate items to agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one in which no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 4 + 20 + 52 + 47 + 75 + 83 + 20 + 99 = 400
   - Agent 1: 0 + 55 + 33 + 99 + 6 + 22 + 99 + 51 = 365
   - Agent 2: 51 + 92 + 70 + 55 + 66 + 26 + 14 + 40 = 414

2. **Calculate Proportional Fair Share:**
   - Since there are 8 items, each agent should ideally get a total value that is at least their proportional fair share, which is the sum of their valuations divided by 3.

3. **Allocating Items:**
   - Allocate items to agents to maximize their utility, aiming to ensure no agent envies another agent's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 7, so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1, so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate the remaining items by comparing the remaining values and assigning them to maximize individual agent utility while preventing envy.

### Execution of Allocation:

1. **Assign Items to Agent 0:**
   - Items: 7 (99 value), 4 (75 value), 5 (83 value)
   - Total value = 99 + 75 + 83 = 257

2. **Assign Items to Agent 1:**
   - Items: 3 (99 value), 6 (99 value)
   - Total value = 99 + 99 = 198

3. **Assign Items to Agent 2:**
   - Items: 1 (92 value), 2 (70 value), 0 (51 value)
   - Total value = 92 + 70 + 51 = 213

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible under the constraints, distributing items to maximize individual satisfaction and attempting to minimize envy. Each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value according to their valuations.
