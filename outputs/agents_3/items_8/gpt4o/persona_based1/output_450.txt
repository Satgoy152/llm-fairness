Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  78  86  76  97  95  12  63
1  78  74  38  42  36  46  37   5
2  12   9  17  78  11  32  41  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that is as close to envy-free as possible, considering that each agent has an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed.

Let's review the valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: [85, 78, 86, 76, 97, 95, 12, 63]
- Agent 1: [78, 74, 38, 42, 36, 46, 37, 5]
- Agent 2: [12, 9, 17, 78, 11, 32, 41, 72]

A common approach is to start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most and then adjust to ensure a fair distribution. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Allocate items based on highest valuations:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (85 is the highest value)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (78 is the highest value)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (86 is the highest value)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (78 is the highest value)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (97 is the highest value)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (95 is the highest value)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (41 is the highest value)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 (72 is the highest value)

2. Verify distribution:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
   - Agent 1: []
   - Agent 2: [3, 6, 7]

3. Adjust to ensure fair distribution:
   - Move item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to give them at least one item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and aims to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valuation preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
