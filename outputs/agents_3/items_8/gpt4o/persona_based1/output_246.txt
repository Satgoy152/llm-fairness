Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  31  57  60  92  72   8  57
1  18  37  79  57   5  60  35  95
2  53   1  93  24   6   7  51  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that considers each agent's preferences and ensures that no agent envies another's allocation. This is known as an envy-free allocation. Given the table of valuations, we can proceed with finding a fair division using a method like the adjusted winner procedure or other approximation techniques, considering each agent's preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to a possible envy-free allocation:

1. **List the Total Value Each Agent Assigns to All Items:**
   - Agent 0: 77 + 31 + 57 + 60 + 92 + 72 + 8 + 57 = 454
   - Agent 1: 18 + 37 + 79 + 57 + 5 + 60 + 35 + 95 = 386
   - Agent 2: 53 + 1 + 93 + 24 + 6 + 7 + 51 + 39 = 274

2. **Find a Fair Allocation:**
   - We need to allocate each item such that the perceived value distribution among the agents is balanced. This means aiming to equalize the total value of items each agent receives, based on their valuations.

3. **Initial Allocation by Valuation:**
   - Start by allocating the highest value items to each agent based on their individual preferences.

4. **Iterative Adjustment:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent feels they are getting a fair share compared to others.

Let's proceed with a hypothetical allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Items: 0, 4, 5
  - Total Value: 77 + 92 + 72 = 241

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: 3, 7
  - Total Value: 57 + 95 = 152

- **Agent 2:**
  - Items: 2, 6, 1
  - Total Value: 93 + 51 + 1 = 145

This allocation aims to respect each agent's highest preferences while maintaining overall fairness. The sum of values for each agent is not equal, but this is a common challenge in fair division, especially with discrete items.

Now, here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation is subject to further adjustments based on refined fairness criteria, but serves as a balanced starting point.
