Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  10  34  64  49  22  65  35
1  67  36  64   1  93  44  54  68
2  38  43  48  81   5  61  34  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a collection of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, given their own valuations. The goal is to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving an envy-free allocation:

1. **Assess Initial Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values items 6 and 3 highly (65, 64).
   - Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 0 (93, 67).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 and 5 highly (81, 61).

2. **Prioritize High-Value Allocations:**
   - Give agent 1 item 4 (value 93) and item 0 (value 67), which they value highest.
   - Give agent 2 item 3 (value 81), which they value highest.
   - Give agent 0 item 6 (value 65), which they value highest.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Now, look at the remaining items: 1, 2, 5, 7.
   - Consider the next highest values for each agent:
     - Agent 0 values item 2 (34) next.
     - Agent 1 values item 7 (68) next.
     - Agent 2 values item 5 (61) next.

4. **Complete Allocation:**
   - Give agent 0 item 2.
   - Give agent 1 item 7.
   - Give agent 2 item 5.
   - Remaining item is 1, which can be given to agent 0, who values it more than others.

5. **Final Check:**
   - Verify that each agent's allocation does not cause significant envy, focusing on their highest valued items being allocated to them.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 1],
    "1": [4, 0, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences and minimize envy as much as possible based on the given valuations.
