Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  76   2  78  32  96  13  83
1  40  31  34  74  10  28  97  29
2   0  93  84  72  95  41  44  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 31 34 74 10 28 97 29]
 [ 0 93 84 72 95 41 44 77]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach helps in ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Given the valuations, we will aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another's allocation. Here is a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Identify High Value Items**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (96).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (95).

2. **Initial Allocation of High Value Items**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Consider the next highest valued unallocated items for each agent, ensuring that each agent's total value is maximized.

4. **Refinement**:
   - Verify that the allocation is fair by ensuring no agent envies another by comparing total valuations.

Here is a possible allocation that satisfies the fair division criteria:

- Agent 0 gets items: [1, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items: [3, 6]
- Agent 2 gets items: [0, 2, 4, 7]

The allocations ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, and attempts to balance the total value received by each.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
