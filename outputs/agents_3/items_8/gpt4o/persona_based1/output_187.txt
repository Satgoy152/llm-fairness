Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  48  41  63  25  21  14  81
1  83  54  28  71  92  93   6  45
2  50  54  10  48  55  32  51   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 54 10 48 55 32 51  0]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

Let's first calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 80 + 48 + 41 + 63 + 25 + 21 + 14 + 81 = 373
- Agent 1: 83 + 54 + 28 + 71 + 92 + 93 + 6 + 45 = 472
- Agent 2: 50 + 54 + 10 + 48 + 55 + 32 + 51 + 0 = 300

Next, we will attempt to allocate items to balance these valuations.

**Allocation Process:**

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent one by one, ensuring no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

2. Continue allocating items while keeping an eye on the cumulative valuation for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [0, 7] (80, 81) = 161
- **Agent 1** gets items: [4, 5, 3] (92, 93, 71) = 256
- **Agent 2** gets items: [1, 2, 6] (54, 10, 51) = 115

This allocation gives the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 161
- Agent 1: 256
- Agent 2: 115

While this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, it reasonably divides the items given the constraints and differences in valuations.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
