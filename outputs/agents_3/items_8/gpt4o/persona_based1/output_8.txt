Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  31  17  96  21  59  93  36
1  25  49   2  21   1   9  19  84
2  78  43  35  42  57  45  96  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations of the agents for the items, we can try to distribute the items in a way that balances the overall satisfaction of each agent. Here is one possible approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Evaluate preferences**: Calculate the total value each agent has for all items to understand their relative preferences.
2. **Initial allocation based on highest valued items**: Allocate items that are most valued by each agent, ensuring that no single agent receives all the high-value items.
3. **Iterate and adjust**: Swap or redistribute items to balance the allocations if necessary.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given values:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 7.
- Agent 2 highly values items 0 and 6.

By considering these preferences, we perform an allocation that tries to balance the overall satisfaction:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value: 96).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest value: 96).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value: 49).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (second highest value: 84).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest value: 57).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value: 78).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second highest value: 59).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value: 17).

This allocation aims for balance and attempts to respect each agent's highest preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items that they value relatively highly.
