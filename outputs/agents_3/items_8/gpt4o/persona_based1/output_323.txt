Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  22  41  41  64  35   2  85
1  54   2  60  85  47   8  62  76
2  30  74  56  17   1  89  77  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 22 41 41 64 35  2 85]
 [54  2 60 85 47  8 62 76]
 [30 74 56 17  1 89 77 59]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. However, given the constraints of integer allocations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible. Instead, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the circumstances.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [72, 22, 41, 41, 64, 35,  2, 85]
Agent 1: [54,  2, 60, 85, 47,  8, 62, 76]
Agent 2: [30, 74, 56, 17,  1, 89, 77, 59]
```

We will try to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Highest Valuation Preference**: Begin by allocating items based on each agent's highest valuation that is not already taken.
2. **Balance**: Adjust the allocations to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 7 (85) and item 0 (72).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 (85) and item 7 (76) highly, but item 7 is taken, so item 3 is a priority.
- **Agent 2** values item 5 (89) and item 6 (77) highly.

#### Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 7 (85), Item 0 (72)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (85)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (89), Item 6 (77)

#### Remaining Items and Further Allocation:

The remaining items are 1, 2, 4. We allocate these to balance the total valuation across agents.

- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (47) and Item 2 (60) as these give reasonable values.
- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (22) to balance Agent 0's allocation.

### Final Allocation:

After balancing the allocations, we have:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 7, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4, 2]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 6]

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 2],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

The allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible.
