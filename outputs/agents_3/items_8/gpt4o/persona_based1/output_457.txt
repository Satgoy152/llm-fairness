Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  20  73  50   2  66  65  35
1  12  14  81  67  88  81  34  87
2  61  39  64  30  73  34  99  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness and efficiency, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. We want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their preferences.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Initial Assignment:** Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Balancing:** Ensure each agent receives an approximately equal share of the total value. This may require some adjustments.

3. **Envy Reduction:** Check if any agent envies another's allocation. If so, try to swap items to reduce or eliminate envy.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0's highest values:** Item 2 (73), Item 6 (65)
- **Agent 1's highest values:** Item 4 (88), Item 7 (87)
- **Agent 2's highest values:** Item 6 (99), Item 7 (92)

To avoid contention and maximize overall satisfaction, we can initially allocate:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5

This covers six items. Now, let's allocate the remaining items 1 and 3.

- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 14, and Agent 2 at 39. Assign it to Agent 2 to maximize satisfaction.

- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 67, and Agent 2 at 30. Assign it to Agent 1 to maximize satisfaction.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6 (Total valuation: 73 + 65 = 138)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7, 3 (Total valuation: 88 + 87 + 67 = 242)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5, 1 (Total valuation: 61 + 34 + 39 = 134)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while aiming for fairness and minimizing envy based on valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 3],
    "2": [0, 5, 1]
}
```
