Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80   1  73  55  74  66  32  12
1  98  84  45  74  79  44  95  16
2  34  85  10  12  28  91  64  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuation Items**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 80, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuation Items**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 98, but since item 0 is already allocated, we assign item 6 (valued at 95) to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2's Highest Valuation Items**: Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 91, so assign item 5 to agent 2.

Now that each agent has received one of their highest-valued items, we continue with the next highest valued items:

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Item 4 is valued at 79 by agent 1, so assign item 4 to agent 1.
   - Item 1 is valued at 85 by agent 2, so assign item 1 to agent 2.
   - Item 2 is valued at 73 by agent 0, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
   - Item 3 is valued at 74 by agent 1, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - Item 7 is valued at 61 by agent 2, so assign item 7 to agent 2.

After this allocation, each agent has a number of items and no more items remain unallocated. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This ensures that each agent receives items, and the distribution attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations.
