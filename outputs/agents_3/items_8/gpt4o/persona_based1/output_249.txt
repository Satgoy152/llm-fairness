Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  30  43  38  53  40  97  81
1  63  93  89  24  47  81  92  87
2  74  72  90  58  96  92  94  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 93 89 24 47 81 92 87]
 [74 72 90 58 96 92 94 36]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent feels another has received a more valuable share.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [75, 30, 43, 38, 53, 40, 97, 81]
- Agent 1 values: [63, 93, 89, 24, 47, 81, 92, 87]
- Agent 2 values: [74, 72, 90, 58, 96, 92, 94, 36]

The goal is to allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We will consider a few steps to ensure fairness:

1. Prioritize high-value items for each agent.
2. Attempt to balance the overall value each agent receives.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

After analyzing the valuations and following the steps above, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 3, 4, 6

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total value of 75 + 81 = 156
- Agent 1 a total value of 93 + 89 + 81 = 263
- Agent 2 a total value of 58 + 96 + 94 = 248

While not perfectly balanced, this allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
