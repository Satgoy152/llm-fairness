Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  37  62  78  42   8  53  23
1  39  48  23  89  63  60  83  36
2  42  95  54  88   8  45  27  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. A common approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" algorithm or similar fair division methods, but for simplicity, we'll use a direct approach here to ensure fairness and balance.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is balanced as much as possible:

### Agents' Total Value Preferences:
- Agent 0: [20, 37, 62, 78, 42, 8, 53, 23] → Total Value: 323
- Agent 1: [39, 48, 23, 89, 63, 60, 83, 36] → Total Value: 441
- Agent 2: [42, 95, 54, 88, 8, 45, 27, 16] → Total Value: 375

### Allocation Strategy:
We'll try assigning the items based on maximizing each agent's happiness while keeping the total values reasonably balanced.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**
1. Start by allocating high-value items to agents who value them the most.
2. Aim for each agent to have a close sum of valuations.

**Allocations:**
- Agent 0 gets items that maximize their total value close to the others.
- Agent 1 gets items that maximize their total value close to the others.
- Agent 2 gets items that maximize their total value close to the others.

We can achieve a fair distribution as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 4, 6]
  - Values: 20, 42, 53 → Total: 115

- Agent 1: [3, 5]
  - Values: 89, 60 → Total: 149

- Agent 2: [1, 2, 7]
  - Values: 95, 54, 16 → Total: 165

This distribution aims to balance the total values while ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and provides a reasonably fair distribution based on the given valuations.
