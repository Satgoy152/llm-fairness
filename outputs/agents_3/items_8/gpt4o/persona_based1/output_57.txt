Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  38  78  53  36  47  46   2
1  66  70  40  54  43  28  78  44
2  52  29  63  99  89  77  30   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that tries to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. This is not always possible to achieve perfectly, but we can attempt to balance the allocations as equitably as possible given the constraints. Considering the valuations given, here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. Among these, items 0 and 2 have particularly high values, so assigning these two items to agent 0 should help to meet their valuation preferences.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high valuations for items 1, 0, and 6. Since item 0 is already allocated to agent 0, we can allocate items 1 and 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5. We will allocate items 3, 4, and 5 to agent 2. 

This leaves items 7 to be allocated. Given the low values for item 7 across the board, it can be allocated to any agent without significantly affecting fairness.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 3, 4, 5, and 7.

This allocation considers the agents' preferences and attempts to balance the overall valuation each agent receives.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, given the constraints of the problem.
