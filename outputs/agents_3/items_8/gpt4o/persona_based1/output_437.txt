Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  86  64  61  63  99  63  23
1  91  81  87  60  42   1  20  84
2  73  58  34  38  76  47  59  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 58 34 38 76 47 59 46]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we aim to make the allocation envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free division ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on the valuations provided.

First, let's compute the total value each agent assigns to all items and then proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0: 13 + 86 + 64 + 61 + 63 + 99 + 63 + 23 = 472  
Agent 1: 91 + 81 + 87 + 60 + 42 + 1 + 20 + 84 = 466  
Agent 2: 73 + 58 + 34 + 38 + 76 + 47 + 59 + 46 = 431  

We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total value is approximately proportional to their total valuation, ensuring fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest total valuation, so we try to give them the items they value the most.
   - Highest values for Agent 0: Item 5 (99), Item 1 (86), Item 2 (64)
   - Allocate: [5, 1, 2]

2. **Agent 1's allocation:**
   - Next, we allocate based on Agent 1's preferences.
   - Highest remaining values for Agent 1: Item 0 (91), Item 2 (87), Item 7 (84)
   - Allocate: [0, 7, 3]

3. **Agent 2's allocation:**
   - Finally, allocate the remaining items to Agent 2.
   - Highest remaining values for Agent 2: Item 4 (76), Item 6 (59)
   - Allocate: [4, 6]

Now, let's ensure that each agent is getting their respective share. Each agent should have some items, and the total number of items allocated to all agents should be exactly 8.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 2],
    "1": [0, 7, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
