Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  22  66  86  98   0  17  78
1  31  59  39  80  81  80  26   3
2  85   3  29  81  31  75  57  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and striving for envy-freeness, we will aim for an allocation where each agent receives items in a manner that minimizes envy. 

Here is one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Each agent has items that they value highly. We can start by ensuring each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

2. **Fair Allocation:** Distribute remaining items to ensure each agent has a fair total valuation of items if possible.

Here is a possible allocation considering the above approach:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 4 the highest (98), followed by item 3 (86).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 1 the highest (59), followed by item 3 (80).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 0 the highest (85), followed by item 5 (75).

Given these preferences, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [3, 7]: These are among the highest-valued items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** gets items [1, 4]: These are valuable to Agent 1 and provide a good total valuation.
- **Agent 2** gets items [0, 2, 5, 6]: These include high-value items for Agent 2 and give a balanced allocation.

Let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value and tries to maintain a sense of fairness based on their valuations.
