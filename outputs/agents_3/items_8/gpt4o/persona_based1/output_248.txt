Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  37   0  51  14  14  24  25
1  57  36  55  57  73  69  61  22
2  64  53  80  97  30  21  51  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the "round-robin" method, which is a common approach for such problems. This method aims to provide each agent with their highest valued remaining item in turns. Here's how it can be applied:

1. **Initialize**: Start with empty allocations for each agent.
2. **Determine Priority**: Use a priority system based on the sum of valuations or rotate turns.
3. **Allocate Items**: In each round, allow each agent to choose their highest valued unallocated item.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - All agents have empty allocations: 
     - Agent 0: []
     - Agent 1: []
     - Agent 2: []

2. **Allocate Items**: Go through several rounds until all items are allocated.

**Round 1**:
- Agent 0 picks item 0 (value = 77).
- Agent 1 picks item 4 (value = 73).
- Agent 2 picks item 3 (value = 97).

**Round 2**:
- Agent 0 picks item 1 (value = 37).
- Agent 1 picks item 5 (value = 69).
- Agent 2 picks item 2 (value = 80).

**Round 3**:
- Agent 0 picks item 7 (value = 25).
- Agent 1 picks item 6 (value = 61).

After these rounds, all items are allocated. The final allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 2]

Now, presenting the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, attempting to minimize envy by giving priority to higher valuations in a round-robin manner.
