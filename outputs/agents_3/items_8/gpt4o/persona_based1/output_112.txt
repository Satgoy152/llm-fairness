Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  7  20  21  62   0  20  66  55
1  2  99  19   3  17  19  40  43
2  3  44  69  94  35  21  50  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent ends up with a fair share of the items without envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes fairness. One approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) concept, which ensures that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

Let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Start by identifying which items have the highest valuations for each agent and attempt to allocate those items to those agents if possible, ensuring each agent receives items with significant value to them.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 6 (66), item 3 (62), and item 7 (55).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (99).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (94), item 7 (89), and item 2 (69).

3. **Make Allocations:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it is highly valued by them.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value for them, and assign item 3 to Agent 2 since they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2 since it is also highly valued by Agent 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is more valuable to them than to others.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is not highly valuable but relatively higher than for others.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it complements their allocation and has some value.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 and Agent 2 have little value for it.

The allocations attempt to ensure that agents receive items they highly value, minimizing envy. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the preferences of the agents as much as possible given the constraints of the problem.
