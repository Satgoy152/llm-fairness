Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19   6  77  55   3  11  88   7
1  37  92  54  34   8  30  33  59
2  82  33  95  51  76  79  48  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 92 54 34  8 30 33 59]
 [82 33 95 51 76 79 48 31]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. We also aim to avoid envy, where possible, meaning each agent should prefer their own allocation over another agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19   6  77  55   3  11  88   7
1  37  92  54  34   8  30  33  59
2  82  33  95  51  76  79  48  31
```

Let's proceed with an allocation that aims for envy-freeness and fairness. One common method for fairly dividing items among agents is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking the most valuable item available to them. However, given the complexity of this problem and the limited number of agents and items, let's manually inspect the matrix to assign items in a way that each agent receives a near-equal value based on their own preferences.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest preference: Item 6 (88)
   - Second preference: Item 2 (77)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest preference: Item 1 (92)
   - Second preference: Item 7 (59)
   - Third preference: Item 0 (37)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest preference: Item 2 (95) already taken by Agent 0, so next best.
   - Second preference: Item 0 (82)
   - Third preference: Item 5 (79)
   - Fourth preference: Item 4 (76)

By balancing the allocations and considering the highest-valued items left for each agent, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 6, 2 (total valuation of 165)
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 7, 3 (total valuation of 185)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 5, 4 (total valuation of 237)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 7, 3],
    "2": [0, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent according to their own valuations. Note that perfect envy-freeness is challenging due to differing preferences and a small number of items, but this allocation strives to minimize envy and maximize perceived fairness.
