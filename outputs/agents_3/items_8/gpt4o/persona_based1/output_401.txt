Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  94  96  61  39  92  68  39
1  45  88  66  71  38  28  78  97
2  84  76  51  62  96  66  56  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that tries to balance the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items.

Let's consider each agent's total valuation for all items and attempt to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. This approach doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but aims to minimize envy.

Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 83 + 94 + 96 + 61 + 39 + 92 + 68 + 39 = 572
- Agent 1: 45 + 88 + 66 + 71 + 38 + 28 + 78 + 97 = 511
- Agent 2: 84 + 76 + 51 + 62 + 96 + 66 + 56 + 14 = 505

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest total valuation, so they should receive high-valued items that are unique to them.
2. Agent 1 and Agent 2 should receive items that maximize their total valuation without creating significant envy.

We can proceed as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 5 (Total valuation for Agent 0: 83 + 94 + 92 = 269)
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 7 (Total valuation for Agent 1: 66 + 71 + 97 = 234)
- Agent 2 receives items: 4, 6 (Total valuation for Agent 2: 96 + 56 = 152)

Let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5] = 269
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 7] = 234
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6] = 152

This distribution aims to balance the perceived value among agents while staying within the constraints.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
