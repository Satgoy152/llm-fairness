Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  96  54  98   6  68  32  58
1  13  69  73  19   1  39  82  14
2  62  75  83  90  43  37  86  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, we consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their preferences. This often involves maximizing the minimum value assigned to any agent or ensuring that no agent would prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent.

Here's a step-by-step guideline to achieve this allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Total = 70 + 96 + 54 + 98 + 6 + 68 + 32 + 58 = 482
   - Agent 1: Total = 13 + 69 + 73 + 19 + 1 + 39 + 82 + 14 = 310
   - Agent 2: Total = 62 + 75 + 83 + 90 + 43 + 37 + 86 + 16 = 492

2. **Determine Fair Share:**
   - Each agent should ideally get items whose total valuation is around one-third of the total sum of item valuations.

3. **Greedy Allocation to Maximize Minimum Satisfaction:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate additional items by considering the current total valuation each agent has and attempting to balance these.

Here is one possible fair and envy-free allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [3, 1]  
  - Total valuation = 98 (item 3) + 96 (item 1) = 194
- **Agent 1** gets items: [6, 2, 5]  
  - Total valuation = 82 (item 6) + 73 (item 2) + 39 (item 5) = 194
- **Agent 2** gets items: [0, 4, 7]  
  - Total valuation = 62 (item 0) + 43 (item 4) + 16 (item 7) = 121

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their total value, reducing envy. Note that there's flexibility in achieving an envy-free solution, and multiple allocations may work.

Finally, the JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
