Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  83  48  40  61  68  72   5
1  67  24  97  58  34  77  72  87
2  53  37  81  83   6   6   6  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 83 48 40 61 68 72  5]
 [67 24 97 58 34 77 72 87]
 [53 37 81 83  6  6  6 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we can try to allocate the items to minimize envy and ensure every agent has a reasonable share of the total value.

The valuations matrix is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  83  48  40  61  68  72   5
1  67  24  97  58  34  77  72  87
2  53  37  81  83   6   6   6  31
```

Let's analyze the data to find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (83), Item 6 (72), Item 5 (68)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 7 (87), Item 5 (77)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (83), Item 2 (81), Item 7 (31)

Considering these preferences, let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items 1, 6
- **Agent 1:** Assign items 2, 7
- **Agent 2:** Assign items 3, 0, 4, 5

This allocation tries to match each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed:

- Agent 0 receives items they value highly (1, 6).
- Agent 1 receives their top-preferred items (2, 7).
- Agent 2 gets a mix that includes their highly valued item (3) and other remaining items.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 0, 4, 5]
}
```
