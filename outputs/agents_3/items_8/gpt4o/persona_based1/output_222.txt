Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  98  70  56   0  81  64  49
1  47  50  92  36  23   0  35  46
2  48  84  57  91  60  19  20  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness (or at least minimizing envy), we can utilize a common approach in fair division problems known as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar heuristic methods that aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step outline to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values each agent assigns to all items.

   - Agent 0: \( 89 + 98 + 70 + 56 + 0 + 81 + 64 + 49 = 507 \)
   - Agent 1: \( 47 + 50 + 92 + 36 + 23 + 0 + 35 + 46 = 329 \)
   - Agent 2: \( 48 + 84 + 57 + 91 + 60 + 19 + 20 + 68 = 447 \)

2. **Initial Allocation**: Distribute items to agents based on the highest individual valuations to ensure each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Swap items between agents to balance the total value each receives and reduce envy.

**Allocation Process:**

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items 1 (98) and 0 (89).
- **Agent 1**: Prefers items 2 (92).
- **Agent 2**: Prefers items 3 (91) and 7 (68).

Assign initial high-value items:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 7.

**Remaining items**: 0, 4, 5, 6

Assign remaining items by balancing the total value:

- Agent 0: Has item 1 (98), add item 0 (89), total = 187
- Agent 1: Has item 2 (92), add items 4 (23) and 6 (35), total = 150
- Agent 2: Has items 3 (91) and 7 (68), add item 5 (19), total = 178

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 7, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value and is a reasonable solution given the provided data.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 7, 5]
}
```
