Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  13  37  71  37  79  67  77
1  18  89  85  81  76  93  32  88
2  84  64  39  87  52  42  21  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 64 39 87 52 42 21 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for all items. The goal is to maximize satisfaction while ensuring fairness. One approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner Procedure" or "Envy-Free Matchings." Here, we'll aim for a simple allocation that ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [86, 13, 37, 71, 37, 79, 67, 77]
- Agent 1: [18, 89, 85, 81, 76, 93, 32, 88]
- Agent 2: [84, 64, 39, 87, 52, 42, 21, 19]

Let's allocate items to agents to ensure envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (86), Item 5 (79), Item 7 (77)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 5, 7

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (89), Item 5 (93), Item 3 (81), Item 7 (88)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 3

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 3 (87), Item 4 (52)
   - Allocate: Items 2, 4, 6

We aim to balance the allocations so that no agent envies another based on their valuations. Let's ensure all items are accounted for:

- Total items: 8
- Allocated:
  - Agent 0: [0, 5, 7] (3 items)
  - Agent 1: [1, 3] (2 items)
  - Agent 2: [2, 4, 6] (3 items)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
