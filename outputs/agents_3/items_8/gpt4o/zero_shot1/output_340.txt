Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62   0  21  22  77  78  84  54
1  38  98  55   4  69  63  56  18
2  95  75  99   0   5  43  49  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value achieved by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a balanced share of items. Here's one potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuation for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Do the same, ensuring not to overlap with previously allocated items.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate remaining items to maximize their value.

Let's work through these steps:

- **Agent 0** prefers: Item 6 (value 84), Item 5 (value 78)
- **Agent 1** prefers: Item 1 (value 98), Item 2 (value 55)
- **Agent 2** prefers: Item 2 (value 99), Item 0 (value 95)

Revisiting to ensure unique allocation:

1. Allocate Item 6 and Item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate Item 1 and Item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, distribute the remaining items (3 and 7) to agents based on their subsequent preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 22)
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (value 57)

Here is a balanced allocation that ensures each agent gets a fair share:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned items, and all 8 items are allocated.
