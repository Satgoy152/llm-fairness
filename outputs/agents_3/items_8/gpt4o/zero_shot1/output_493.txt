Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  25  21  88  92  52  72  93
1  24  25  95  70  94  84  89  90
2  65  54  39  12  47   6  33  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive 3 items, and the other two will receive 2 items each. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items:**
   - Look for items with the highest value for each agent to ensure they receive items they value highly.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Begin by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring no conflicts (i.e., no two agents receive the same item).

3. **Adjust and Balance:**
   - Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives the correct number of items, balancing the total value each agent receives.

**Agent-Item Valuation Highlights:**
- Agent 0 values item 7 (93) and item 4 (92) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 2 (95) and item 4 (94) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 7 (94) highly.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Assign items based on high valuations while meeting the condition of distributing 8 items in total.

Here's the fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [3, 5] (Values: 88, 52)
- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 6, 4] (Values: 95, 89, 94)
- **Agent 2:** Items [0, 1, 7] (Values: 65, 54, 94)

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives high-value items for them.
- Agent 1 gets two of their highest valued items.
- Agent 2 receives three items, including one of their highest-value items.

**JSON Output:**
```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 6, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```
