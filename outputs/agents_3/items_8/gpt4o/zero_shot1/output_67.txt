Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  72  86  87  21  22  23  35
1  75   5  27   7  60  46   5  23
2  32  11  24  46  69  10  29  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to each item. Let's go through the items and allocate them to the agents:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values at 50
   - Agent 1 values at 75
   - Agent 2 values at 32
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values at 72
   - Agent 1 values at 5
   - Agent 2 values at 11
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values at 86
   - Agent 1 values at 27
   - Agent 2 values at 24
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values at 87
   - Agent 1 values at 7
   - Agent 2 values at 46
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values at 21
   - Agent 1 values at 60
   - Agent 2 values at 69
   - Allocate to Agent 2

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values at 22
   - Agent 1 values at 46
   - Agent 2 values at 10
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values at 23
   - Agent 1 values at 5
   - Agent 2 values at 29
   - Allocate to Agent 2

8. Item 7:
   - Agent 0 values at 35
   - Agent 1 values at 23
   - Agent 2 values at 58
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
