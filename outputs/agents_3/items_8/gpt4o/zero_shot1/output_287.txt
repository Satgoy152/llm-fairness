Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  83  50  69  30  23  98  53
1  80  35  25  75  19  97  91  10
2  28  52   5  66  78  37  30  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction. One approach is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) method, which aims to balance the product of the agents' utilities. However, for simplicity, I will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets roughly equal total value, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's start by calculating a fair distribution manually:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 highly (98). Assign item 6 first. They also value item 0 (90) next. Assign item 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 highly (97). Assign item 5. They also value item 3 (75) next. Assign item 3.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 4 highly (78). Assign item 4. They also value item 1 (52) next. Assign item 1.

4. **Remaining Items**: Items 2 and 7 are left.

   - **Agent 0**: Assign item 7 (53), as agent 0's next highest value.
   - **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (25), as it's the next available, and agent 1 has already received significant value with previous items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
