Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  95  23  62  64  92  82   8
1  20  88   9  53   9  54  24  82
2  13   3   0  37  88  77  33  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. A simple approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

Let's look at a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most.

Considering these preferences, and aiming for a fair distribution, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's format the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each item to the agent who values it highly, while ensuring all 8 items are allocated across the agents.
