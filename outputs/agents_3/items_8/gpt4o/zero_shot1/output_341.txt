Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  33  87  74  86  75  95   4
1  11  15  52  75  52  93  16  23
2  46  81  52   4  91  40  76  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8. Let's evaluate each agent's valuations and allocate items based on maximizing their satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Highest values are for items 6 (95), 2 (87), 4 (86), 3 (74), 5 (75).

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Highest values are for items 5 (93), 3 (75), 2 (52, shared), 4 (52, shared).

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - Highest values are for items 4 (91), 1 (81), 6 (76), 0 (46).

Considering these valuations, we will aim to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences, while ensuring every item is allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 6, 2
  - This gives them high-value items (95 and 87).

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 5, 3, 0
  - This gives them high-value items (93 and 75), and item 0 which is less competitive.

- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 4, 1, 7
  - This gives them high-value items (91 and 81), and item 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly while distributing all 8 items:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [5, 3, 0],
    "2": [4, 1, 7]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the values each agent receives and allocate all items fairly.
