Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  63  12  27  95  26   0  22
1  31  97  72  47   0  16  46   8
2  58  26  34  15  25  79  71  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that maximizes each agent's total value. We will assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's go through the items and assign them:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 4: Value 95 (Highest value among all items for Agent 0)
   - Item 1: Value 63 (Next highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 3: Value 27 (Next highest value for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2: Value 72 (Highest value among all items for Agent 1)
   - Item 0: Value 31 (Next highest value for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 5: Value 79 (Highest value among all items for Agent 2)
   - Item 6: Value 71 (Next highest value for Agent 2)
   - Item 7: Value 73 (Next highest value for Agent 2)

Now, let's ensure that the total number of allocated items is 8. Items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: [4, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 0]
- Agent 2: [5, 6, 7]

The allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
