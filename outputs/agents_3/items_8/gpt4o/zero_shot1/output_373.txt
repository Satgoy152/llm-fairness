Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  31  12  90  55  29  14  68
1  60  60  52  12  27  10  12  81
2  27  92  69  64  31  51  44  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 90
  - Item 4: 55
  - Item 5: 29
  - Item 6: 14
  - Item 7: 68

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 27
  - Item 5: 10
  - Item 6: 12
  - Item 7: 81

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 69
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 31
  - Item 5: 51
  - Item 6: 44
  - Item 7: 35

A possible allocation strategy is to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's an allocation that attempts to do this:

- Assign Item 3 and Item 7 to Agent 0 (values: 90 and 68).
- Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1 (values: 60 and 52).
- Assign Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6 to Agent 2 (values: 92, 31, 51, and 44).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some items and the distribution tries to maximize the individual satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
