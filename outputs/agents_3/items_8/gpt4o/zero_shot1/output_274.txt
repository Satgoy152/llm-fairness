Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  41  23  64  70  58  33  85
1  74  95  23  77  54  35  81  79
2  54   4  24  81   7  25  44  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets some items. We can consider various strategies, such as maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives or balancing the total number of items each agent gets. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation across agents.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [65, 41, 23, 64, 70, 58, 33, 85]
- Agent 1: [74, 95, 23, 77, 54, 35, 81, 79]
- Agent 2: [54,  4, 24, 81,  7, 25, 44, 66]

Based on the highest valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.

Now, we distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 74, which is the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 23, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 70, which is the highest.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 58, which is the highest.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most, maximizing the overall satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation allows each agent to receive items according to their highest valuation, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given table.
