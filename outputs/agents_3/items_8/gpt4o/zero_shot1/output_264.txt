Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  35  50  61  41  93  36  91
1  55  35  57   6  28  88  71  19
2  99  57  35  47  93  73  57  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List all items with their valuations for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: (0, 40), (1, 35), (2, 50), (3, 61), (4, 41), (5, 93), (6, 36), (7, 91)
   - Agent 1: (0, 55), (1, 35), (2, 57), (3, 6),  (4, 28), (5, 88), (6, 71), (7, 19)
   - Agent 2: (0, 99), (1, 57), (2, 35), (3, 47), (4, 93), (5, 73), (6, 57), (7, 14)

2. **Consider a fair allocation strategy**: 
   - We need to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

3. **Allocate items to agents**: 
   - We can start by assigning each agent the item(s) where they have the highest relative valuation compared to others.

4. **Assignment**:
   - Assign items to agents based on maximizing each agent's preferences while keeping the allocation fair and balanced.

After evaluating the valuations and ensuring a fair distribution, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 7, where they have high valuations.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, maximizing their preference for that item.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, where they have relatively high valuations compared to others.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, taking into account the preferences of each agent.
