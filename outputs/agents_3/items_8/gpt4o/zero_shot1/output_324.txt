Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  46  95  66  47  72  13   6
1  23   1  35  60  31  92  84  37
2  22   9  30  35  15  89  49  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22  9 30 35 15 89 49 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing the individual agent's value while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (95), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (92), so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (89) but since it's already taken, we look for the next highest value for Agent 2, which is item 6 (49), so we assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Continuing in a similar manner while ensuring fairness:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 66), as this is the next highest value not claimed by an agent with a higher priority.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 37), as Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 46), as Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 15), ensuring Agent 2 also gets a fair share.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 39), as this is the remaining item with the highest valuation for Agent 0.

This leaves us with the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives some items based on their valuation.
