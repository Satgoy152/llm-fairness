Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  84   7  75  85  73  55  27
1  85  89  25  49   1  35  65  37
2  63  82  19  87   8  83  38  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations given by each agent to each item and try to distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible. I'll use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this.

First, we could attempt to assign the items such that each agent's total valuation is approximately equal. This approach might involve giving each agent a chance to bid or pick items based on their highest valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [55, 84, 7, 75, 85, 73, 55, 27]
- Agent 1: [85, 89, 25, 49, 1, 35, 65, 37]
- Agent 2: [63, 82, 19, 87, 8, 83, 38, 23]

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy:
1. Assign each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Repeat the process while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total number of items, which is 8 in total.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (valuation of 89). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (valuation of 85). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (valuation of 87). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 5 the next highest (valuation of 73). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 0 next (valuation of 85). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 7 next (valuation of 23). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
7. Agent 0 values item 6 next (valuation of 55). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. Finally, Agent 2 values item 2 next (valuation of 19). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed between the agents and attempts to balance the valuations.
