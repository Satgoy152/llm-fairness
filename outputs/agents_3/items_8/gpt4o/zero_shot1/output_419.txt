Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  81  35  74   8  98  67  64
1  99  81  40  68  96  73   2  83
2  92  55  64  65  71  97  49   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute the items in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's total value.

Let's break down each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 99 + 81 + 35 + 74 + 8 + 98 + 67 + 64 = 526
- Agent 1: 99 + 81 + 40 + 68 + 96 + 73 + 2 + 83 = 542
- Agent 2: 92 + 55 + 64 + 65 + 71 + 97 + 49 + 1 = 494

Next, we allocate items by considering where each item gives the highest value to an agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 and 1 both value it at 99, but Agent 2 values it at 92. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 and 1 both value it at 81, but Agent 2 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it highest at 64. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 68, Agent 2 at 65. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest at 97. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it highest at 67. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it highest at 83. Allocate to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and all items are distributed while maximizing individual agent valuation where possible.
