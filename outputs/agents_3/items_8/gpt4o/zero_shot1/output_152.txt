Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  64  21  35  92  90  37  62
1  37  85   4  70  41  38  50  13
2  92  88  73   4  51  96  90  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 88 73  4 51 96 90 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate potential allocations that maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (92), Item 5 (90), Item 0 (81)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (85), Item 3 (70)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (96), Item 0 (92), Item 6 (90)

We want to ensure each agent gets a fair share, considering their highest preferences and avoiding conflicts:

- Agent 0 could get Item 4 (92) and Item 5 (90).
- Agent 1 could get Item 1 (85) and Item 3 (70).
- Agent 2 could get Item 0 (92), Item 6 (90), Item 2 (73), and Item 7 (82).

This allocation gives a fair balance based on the highest valuations for each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share of the highest-valued items according to their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.
