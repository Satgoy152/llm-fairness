Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  61  89  19  13   5  17   6
1  16   8  86   7  51  80  51  64
2  15  59  35  95  40  68  59  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here, we can use a balanced approach to distribute the items based on the valuations provided.

Let's examine the values and allocate the items:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent and proceed to balance the allocation.

- Agent 0 has the highest values for items 2, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest values for items 5, 2, and 7.
- Agent 2 has the highest values for items 3, 5, and 1.

Allocate based on the highest values:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the highest value (89).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is the highest value (80).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is the highest value (95).

Remaining items: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (61), since it's the second-highest value remaining.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (64), as it is the second-highest value remaining.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (59), as it is the highest value for Agent 2 remaining.

Remaining items: 0, 4

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (12), as Agent 0 has 12, which is better than others.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (51), as Agent 1 values it the most.

Now, each agent has been allocated items, and all items have been distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 0],
    "1": [5, 7, 4],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
