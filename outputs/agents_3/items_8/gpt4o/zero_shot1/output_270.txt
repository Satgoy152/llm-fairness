Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15   3  50  38  83  56  65  74
1   7  91  85   7  48  13  55  85
2  10  50   6   2   7  21  77  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 50  6  2  7 21 77 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to distribute the items to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One common approach is to use a greedy allocation method, considering the highest valuations first and attempting to balance the distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (valuation: 91).
2. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (valuation: 86).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (valuation: 83).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (valuation: 85).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (valuation: 77).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (valuation: 38).
7. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (valuation: 15).
8. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (valuation: 21).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and balances the allocation based on each agent's valuation.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
