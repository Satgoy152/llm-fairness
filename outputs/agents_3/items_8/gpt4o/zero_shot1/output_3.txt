Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  24  38  27  21  39  62  54
1  29  34  54  75   8  28   6  58
2  15  90  75  43  37   0  50  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our aim is to distribute the items in a way that respects these valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 and a good valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 and good valuations for items 2 and 7.

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Agent 0 gets items 0 and 6.
2. Agent 1 gets items 2, 3, and 5.
3. Agent 2 gets items 1, 4, and 7.

This allocation respects the high valuations of each agent and ensures all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
