Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  32  97   7  71  67  96  55
1  96  85  57  55  12  39   3  50
2  52  10   2   2   7   2  54  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. One approach is to go through the items one by one and assign each to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure a balanced distribution.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Consider each item individually and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Keep track of the number of items each agent has received.
3. As there are 8 items and 3 agents, aim to distribute the items as evenly as possible. Ideally, two agents will receive 3 items each, and one agent will receive 2 items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 7.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 71.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 55.

Now let's ensure a fair distribution. We notice that Agent 0 is receiving too many items. We need to balance this:

- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 55, which is higher than Agent 2's 2).
- Reassign Item 4 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it at 7, which is the same as Agent 0's but Agent 0 already has many items).

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 7

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly among the agents, respecting their valuations.
