Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  48  16  17  75  52  57  85
1  13  59  19  84  53  60  81  82
2  71  15  29  17  34  28  71  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 59 19 84 53 60 81 82]
 [71 15 29 17 34 28 71 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive if they were assigned the items that maximize their individual preferences.
2. Distribute the items to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and the distribution is fair in terms of value.

After analyzing the table, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [4, 7]
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 5, 6]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 1, 2]

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
