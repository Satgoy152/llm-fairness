Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  44  20  48   1  50  97  55
1  93  33  19  31  35   1  22  38
2  71  15  13  54  83  14  29   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 15 13 54 83 14 29  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total value, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (97), so we assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (93), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (83), so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Next, we consider the remaining unassigned items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

5. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 5 (50), so we assign item 5 to agent 0.
6. Agent 2 values item 3 next highest (54), so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
7. Agent 0 values item 3 next highest (48), but it is already taken. The next highest available is item 7 (55), so we assign item 7 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 values item 1 next highest (33), so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
9. Finally, item 2 is left, which agent 0 values at 20, agent 1 at 19, and agent 2 at 13. We assign item 2 to agent 0, who values it the most among the available choices.

Here is the allocation in json format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
