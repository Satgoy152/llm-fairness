Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  53  77  10  53  26  41   9
1  60  74  68  98  11  86  51  53
2  23  57  90  74   4  85  78   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering each agent's valuation, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with high value to them, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Using a greedy approach, we allocate items to agents based on their highest value preferences:

- Agent 0 values items 2, 1, and 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values items 3, 5, and 1 the most.
- Agent 2 values items 2, 5, and 6 the most.

Given these preferences, we aim to ensure each agent gets a reasonably high value in their allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items with highest valuations to different agents, balancing the allocation so that each agent can get their preferred items without overlap, as much as possible.

#### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 1] (valuations 77, 53)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5] (valuations 98, 86)
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6, 4, 7] (valuations 23, 78, 4, 2)

Here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their preferences and all items are allocated.
