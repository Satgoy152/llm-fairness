Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  29  47  53   3   7  33  31
1  15  93  34  35  92  25   8  44
2  96  78  40  68  53  92  22  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0's highest value items are: 0 (71), 3 (53), 2 (47).
2. Agent 1's highest value items are: 1 (93), 4 (92), 2 (34).
3. Agent 2's highest value items are: 0 (96), 5 (92), 3 (68).

One possible allocation strategy could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because they value it the most.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it the most.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because they value it highly, and itâ€™s the highest remaining for Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it's their next highest value.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because they value it the most after item 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 because they value it the most after items 0 and 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 because it's next highest for Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 because they have space left and value it more than Agent 0.

Based on this approach, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the given valuations.
