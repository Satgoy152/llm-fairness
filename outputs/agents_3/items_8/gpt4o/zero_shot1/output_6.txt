Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  21  52  93  39  15  22  21
1  56  96  26  28   0  51  83   2
2  62  98  71  94   6  75  93  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent. This can be done by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and distributing them accordingly, ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal share of total value.

Let's examine the highest values and distribute the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (90), 3 (93), and 2 (52).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (96), 5 (51), and 6 (83).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 (98), 3 (94), and 6 (93).

To balance the distribution, we can proceed as follows:

1. Item 0 is best valued by Agent 0.
2. Item 1 is best valued by Agent 2.
3. Item 2 is best valued by Agent 0.
4. Item 3 is best valued by Agent 2.
5. Item 4 can go to Agent 0 as Agent 0 has a somewhat higher valuation compared to others.
6. Item 5 can go to Agent 1.
7. Item 6 can go to Agent 2.
8. Item 7 can go to Agent 1 as Agent 1 has a need for more items.

Following this distribution, each agent should receive a fair number of items with respect to what they value most:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items in such a way as to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their specific valuations.
