Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  82  62  96  80   9  73  83
1  92  49  64  79  13  67  47  12
2  24  92  97  46   2  17  75  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent is assigned an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one approach is to allocate 2 or 3 items to each agent, ensuring all 8 items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (96), 1 (82), 7 (83)
   - Allocated items: 3, 7

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (92), 3 (79), 2 (64)
   - Allocated items: 0, 2, 5

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 2 (97), 1 (92)
   - Allocated items: 1, 6, 4

Now let's check the allocations to ensure all items are assigned and each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [3, 7] 
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 6, 4]

This ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 4]
}
```
