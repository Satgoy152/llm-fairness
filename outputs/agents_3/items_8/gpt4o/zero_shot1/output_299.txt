Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  83  11  13   1  90   4  11
1  90  64   5  32  23  90  58   0
2  93  88  18  99   2  27  24  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One approach is to iterate through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items. Given that there are 8 items to allocate among 3 agents, one possible fair distribution could be to give 3 items to two agents and 2 items to one agent.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 88.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 11.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 23.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 90. Allocate to Agent 0 (since Agent 2 already has 3 items).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 58.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 39.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 2 items (2, 5)
- Agent 1: 2 items (4, 6)
- Agent 2: 4 items (0, 1, 3, 7)

However, to ensure fairness in terms of the number of items, we need to adjust:

1. Reassign Item 7 from Agent 2 to Agent 1, balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: 2 items (2, 5)
- Agent 1: 3 items (4, 6, 7)
- Agent 2: 3 items (0, 1, 3)

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
