Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   4  25  50   9  94   4   7
1  44  11  93  84  38  85   5  48
2  88   8  70   5  41  45  30  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that are relatively more valuable to Agent 0 compared to others. This includes item 3, which has a value of 50 for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that have high value for Agent 1. Item 2 has a very high value (93) for Agent 1, so it should be given to them. Similarly, item 1 has a value of 11, which is highest for Agent 1 among all agents.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items that have high value for Agent 2. Item 0 has a value of 88 for Agent 2, and item 5 has a value of 45, both of which are relatively higher compared to other agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 4] (values: 50, 9)
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 1, 7] (values: 93, 11, 48)
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 5, 6] (values: 88, 45, 30)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with considerable value to them, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 1, 7],
    "2": [0, 5, 6]
}
```
