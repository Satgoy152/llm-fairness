Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   0  27   3  60  94  14  64
1  72  95  98  74  17  18  83  62
2  26  21  37  91  72  22  29  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the overall satisfaction or value that each agent receives based on their provided valuations. Since each agent must receive an integer number of items and there are 8 items in total, we will distribute these items in a manner that reflects the valuations as closely as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (94), 4 (60), 7 (64)
   - Total items: 3

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (98), 1 (95), 6 (83)
   - Total items: 3

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (91), 0 (26)
   - Total items: 2

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 1, 6],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
