Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  56  43  75  93   7   9  44
1   5  40  61   7  91   8  67  48
2  78  27  48  85  94  35  32  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Start by listing the valuations for each item by each agent.
2. Attempt to assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure that each agent receives some items, or at least try to balance the distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Items favored by Agent 0: Items 3 (75), 4 (93)
- Items favored by Agent 1: Item 2 (61), 4 (91)
- Items favored by Agent 2: Items 0 (78), 3 (85), 4 (94), 7 (88)

Considering the highest value for every item while distributing the items, we can make the following allocations:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (78)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (56)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (61)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (85)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (94)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (7)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (67)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 (88)

This allocation ensures that Agent 2 gets more items due to their higher valuations, while Agents 0 and 1 also receive items based on relative valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 4, 7]
}
```

This distribution maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.
