Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  21  37  26   7   5  39  43
1  60  21  23  70  82  11  57  25
2  31  10  20  53  92  31  90   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If two agents have the same value, assign based on the remaining capacity or other items already allocated to ensure balance.

2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated matches the number of items available (8 items in this case).

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 21.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 37.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 70.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 31.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 43.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and the total number of items allocated is 8. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair number of items relative to their preferences and valuations.
