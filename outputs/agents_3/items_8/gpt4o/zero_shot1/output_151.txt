Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  84  56  43  53  76  92  43
1  76  13  23  62  17  40  46  51
2  70  15  85  69  68  33  95  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives approximately equal value from the items they get. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Value:** First, calculate the total value of all items for each agent to understand their preferences. 

2. **Assign Items:** Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most, followed by items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, followed by items 3 and 7.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, followed by items 6 and 3.

Based on these valuations, we can allocate items to agents:

- **Agent 0:** Items 6, 1
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 3, 7
- **Agent 2:** Items 2, 5, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, while the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 4]
}
```
