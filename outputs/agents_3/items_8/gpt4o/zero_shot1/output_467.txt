Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  33  92  43  82  87  58   8
1  18  26  76  77  82  48  80  50
2  74   9  56  53   7  99   7  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 26 76 77 82 48 80 50]
 [74  9 56 53  7 99  7 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated.

One approach to solve this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most and assign the item to that agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Verify that all items are allocated.

Let's apply this strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 74, which is the highest.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 33, which is the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, which is the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 77, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 82. Assign it to Agent 1 to balance allocations.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 99, which is the highest.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 80, which is the highest.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 50, which is the highest.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
