Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  25  43  44  70  89   3  44
1  88  34   4   9   6  86  79  94
2  56  68  49  24  98  21  41  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 34  4  9  6 86 79 94]
 [56 68 49 24 98 21 41 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Let's analyze the valuations to make an efficient allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (value 89)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (value 70)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (value 44)
   - Allocate items: 5, 4, 3

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 88)
   - Second highest: Item 7 (value 94)
   - Allocate items: 0, 7

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (value 98) [already allocated]
   - Second highest: Item 1 (value 68)
   - Third highest: Item 7 (value 69) [already allocated]
   - Fourth highest: Item 2 (value 49)
   - Allocate items: 1, 2, 6

Now let's check the allocations. Agent 0 has 3 items, Agent 1 has 2 items, and Agent 2 has 3 items, totaling 8 items, which satisfies the condition.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
