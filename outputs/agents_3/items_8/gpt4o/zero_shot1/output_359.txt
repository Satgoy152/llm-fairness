Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  37  86  67  89  43  22  89
1  62  38  81  69  99  21  84  63
2  14  77  70  32  18  53  90  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 37 86 67 89 43 22 89]
 [62 38 81 69 99 21 84 63]
 [14 77 70 32 18 53 90 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is one way to allocate items:

- Agent 0 values: [99, 37, 86, 67, 89, 43, 22, 89]
- Agent 1 values: [62, 38, 81, 69, 99, 21, 84, 63]
- Agent 2 values: [14, 77, 70, 32, 18, 53, 90, 42]

Items can be allocated as follows to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring fairness:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 99)
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value = 77)
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 86)
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value = 69)
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 99)
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (value = 53)
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value = 90)
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 89)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations.
