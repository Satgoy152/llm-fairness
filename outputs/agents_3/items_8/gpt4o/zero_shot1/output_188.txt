Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   9   0  23   2   0  22  77
1  72  98  43   5  14  52  56  73
2  19  74  38  62   0   4  74  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 98 43  5 14 52 56 73]
 [19 74 38 62  0  4 74 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (91) and item 7 (77), so we can allocate these to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 places the highest value on item 1 (98) and also values item 6 (56) and item 5 (52) significantly, so we can allocate these to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 places high value on item 2 (38), item 3 (62), and item 4 (0 is low, but it needs to be allocated), so we can allocate these to Agent 2.

Let's check the allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 7.
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 5, 6.
- Agent 2 receives items: 2, 3, 4.

This allocation gives each agent items, respects their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
