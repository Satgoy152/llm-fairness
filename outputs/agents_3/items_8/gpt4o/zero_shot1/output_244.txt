Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  21  69  89  35  56  80  22
1  94   1   0  96  16  82  60   9
2  66  68  17  71  82  94  44  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one approach to achieve this:

First, let's list the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate items based on maximizing the total value:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Items: 3 (89), 0 (86), 6 (80), 2 (69)
  
- Agent 1 values:
  - Items: 3 (96), 0 (94), 5 (82), 6 (60)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Items: 5 (94), 4 (82), 3 (71), 1 (68)

We can aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for any agent)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value not yet allocated)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest for Agent 2)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (remaining item)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent gets from the items they receive.
