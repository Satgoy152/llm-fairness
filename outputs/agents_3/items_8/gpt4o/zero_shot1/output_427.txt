Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  90  29  94  99  23  27  66
1  42  34  84  47  75  20  86  17
2  38  99  20  93   1  75  21  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 90 29 94 99 23 27 66]
 [42 34 84 47 75 20 86 17]
 [38 99 20 93  1 75 21 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim to balance the allocations based on the valuations presented in the table.

Let's analyze the values and try to allocate items accordingly:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 3 and 4. Let's allocate these to agent 0.
   - Item 0 has a high value for agent 0, so let's allocate it as well.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 2 and 6. Let's allocate these to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 1 and 7. Let's allocate these to agent 2.
   - Item 5 also has a relatively high value for agent 2 compared to the others.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the agents' preferences and distributes the items fairly among them.
