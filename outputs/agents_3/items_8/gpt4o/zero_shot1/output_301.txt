Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81   6  93  93  56  88  49  34
1  81  79   1  37  77  44  78  84
2  49  53  62  23  41  69  72  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to fair allocation is ensuring each agent receives items corresponding to their preferences while trying to maintain a balance in overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's high-value items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (93), Item 3 (93), Item 5 (88)
   - Allocate: Items 2, 3, and 5

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (81), Item 1 (79), Item 7 (84)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 1, and 7

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (72), Item 7 (94)
   - Allocate: Items 4 and 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value while distributing the items fairly across the agents. Note that we're trying to ensure a balanced distribution, considering each agent's preferences and the total number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
