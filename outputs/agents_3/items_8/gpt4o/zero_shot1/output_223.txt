Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  81  86  85  81  94   0  88
1  22   8  31  85   1  86  99  21
2  58  33  62  72  15  21  45   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive, considering their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: High valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Agent 1: High valuations for items 3, 5, 6
- Agent 2: Moderate valuations across most items

A possible fair allocation strategy is to ensure each agent gets a high-value item according to their preferences while distributing the rest to balance the total value across agents.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1 gets items 3, 5, 6
- Agent 2 gets items 4, 7

These allocations aim to respect the relative valuations each agent has for certain items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```
