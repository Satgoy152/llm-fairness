Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  96  89  30  87  73  61   1
1  15   4  27  40  91   3  12  13
2  33  99  72  55  90  85  97  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we will consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We have 8 items and 3 agents. To start, we can attempt to allocate approximately 8 / 3 â‰ˆ 2.67 items per agent, which means two agents would get 3 items each and one agent would get 2 items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest values: 96 (item 1), 89 (item 2), 87 (item 4)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest values: 91 (item 4), 40 (item 3), 27 (item 2)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest values: 99 (item 1), 97 (item 6), 90 (item 4)

To ensure a fair allocation, we can try the following approach:

1. Assign items with the highest valuations to each agent, while balancing the number of items:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 5, 7]

Now, let's check if this allocation uses all 8 items:

Agent 0 has items: 1, 2, 4
Agent 1 has items: 3, 0
Agent 2 has items: 6, 5, 7

This accounts for all 8 items being allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [6, 5, 7]
}
```
