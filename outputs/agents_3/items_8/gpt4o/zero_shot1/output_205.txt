Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  97  20  97  91  61  33   8
1  98  20  43   2  80  44  32  25
2  71  89  92  25  70  39  84  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 20 43  2 80 44 32 25]
 [71 89 92 25 70 39 84 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item values: [13, 97, 20, 97, 91, 61, 33, 8]

- Agent 1:
  - Item values: [98, 20, 43, 2, 80, 44, 32, 25]

- Agent 2:
  - Item values: [71, 89, 92, 25, 70, 39, 84, 82]

A fair allocation will attempt to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is relatively balanced. We can do this by analyzing the values and ensuring each agent ends up with a reasonable sum of valuations. 

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 1, 3, 5 (Values: 97, 97, 61)

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 0, 4 (Values: 98, 80)

- Agent 2:
  - Items: 2, 6, 7 (Values: 92, 84, 82)

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences.
