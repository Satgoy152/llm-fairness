Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  27  80  59  62  72  56  32
1   1   2   5  28  14  59   5  49
2  14  12  33  54   7  63  49  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to use the following method:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, prioritizing the agent who values the item the most, and ensuring each agent gets a proportional number of items.

Let's apply this method to the given data:

### Step 1: Total Valuation for Each Agent
- Agent 0: 64 + 27 + 80 + 59 + 62 + 72 + 56 + 32 = 452
- Agent 1: 1 + 2 + 5 + 28 + 14 + 59 + 5 + 49 = 163
- Agent 2: 14 + 12 + 33 + 54 + 7 + 63 + 49 + 98 = 330

### Step 2: Allocate Items
We will allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring a fair distribution.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (64).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (27).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (59).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (62).
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (63).
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (49).
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (98).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives a fair proportion:
- Agent 0 has 5 items.
- Agent 1 has 0 items, which is not fair. Let's redistribute by assigning items valued by Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has 3 items.

To balance, let's give Agent 1 some items:

1. Transfer Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
2. Transfer Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Revised Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6, 7]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations.
