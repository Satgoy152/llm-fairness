Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  45  83  25  97  67  40  71
1  19  19  98  45  17  18  97  11
2  32   4  84  29  35  25  13  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes fairness based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets approximately an equal number of items, as much as possible considering there are 8 items and 3 agents.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 2 (83), Item 7 (71)
   - Allocate: Items 2, 4, and 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (98), Item 6 (97), Item 3 (45)
   - Allocate: Items 3 and 6

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (84), Item 3 (29), Item 7 (11)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 1, and 5

Let's ensure that all items are allocated and no item is double-allocated:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: 2, 4, 7
- Items allocated to Agent 1: 3, 6
- Items allocated to Agent 2: 0, 1, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated without duplication.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
