Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  77  47  92  40  89   6  84
1  84  87  22  33  58  34  67  51
2  49  70  29  27  96  81  77  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. We'll proceed by looking to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is reasonably balanced.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value: 92)
   - Next highest value item: Item 5 (value: 89)
   - Total value: 181

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value: 87)
   - Next highest value item: Item 0 (value: 84)
   - Total value: 171

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value: 96)
   - Next highest value item: Item 6 (value: 77)
   - Total value: 173

Lastly, let's distribute the remaining items fairly:

- Agent 0 gets Item 7 (value: 84)
- Agent 1 gets Item 2 (value: 22)
- Agent 2 gets Item 3 (value: 27)

After this, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
