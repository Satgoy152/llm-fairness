Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  83  24   6  26  17   0  58
1  52  68  19  16  53  30  39  14
2  60  30  90  41  20  23   6  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 68 19 16 53 30 39 14]
 [60 30 90 41 20 23  6 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

Agent 0:
- Values: [4, 83, 24, 6, 26, 17, 0, 58]
- Total value if assigned: 218

Agent 1:
- Values: [52, 68, 19, 16, 53, 30, 39, 14]
- Total value if assigned: 291

Agent 2:
- Values: [60, 30, 90, 41, 20, 23, 6, 32]
- Total value if assigned: 302

Let's allocate items by maximizing the value for each agent:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 83).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 90).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 52).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 53).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 41).
6. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 58).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 30).
8. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 6).

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
