Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  29  86  44  66  89   5  34
1  97  59  20  82  58   6  51  90
2  96  30  61  32   2  41  29  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents, taking into consideration their valuations. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation per item, ensuring that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 97
   - Agent 2 values it at 96
   - Assign to Agent 1 (97 is the highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 30
   - Assign to Agent 1 (59 is the highest valuation)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Agent 2 values it at 61
   - Assign to Agent 0 (86 is the highest valuation)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 32
   - Assign to Agent 1 (82 is the highest valuation)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 2
   - Assign to Agent 0 (66 is the highest valuation)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Assign to Agent 0 (89 is the highest valuation)

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 51
   - Agent 2 values it at 29
   - Assign to Agent 1 (51 is the highest valuation)

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 68
   - Assign to Agent 1 (90 is the highest valuation)

After assigning each item to the agent with the highest valuation, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, within the constraints provided.
