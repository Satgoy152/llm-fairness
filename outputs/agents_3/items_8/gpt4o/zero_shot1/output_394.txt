Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  99  30  59  21  82  20  49
1  66  32  15  99  37  70  61  75
2  43  69  84  49  32   8  76   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can try to distribute items so that each agent receives approximately the same total value.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 3 and decent valuations for items 6, 7.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2, 6 and a moderate valuation for item 1.

A possible allocation strategy could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 6, and 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4.

Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items while attempting to balance the total valuations each agent receives.
