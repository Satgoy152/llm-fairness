Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  17  58  46  62   0  75  99
1  81  89   3  67  94  79  45  95
2  40  90  19  71  11  37  46  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 71.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 79.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.

Based on this greedy allocation, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
