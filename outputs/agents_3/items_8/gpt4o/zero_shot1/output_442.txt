Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  57  58  81  64  32  18  77
1  29  57  49  52   2   3  58  50
2  80  93  25  72  92  65   9   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. We'll consider the valuations provided and attempt to assign items such that the distribution is balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Highest value items: 3 (81), 7 (77), 4 (64)

Agent 1:
- Highest value items: 0 (29), 2 (49), 1 (57)

Agent 2:
- Highest value items: 1 (93), 4 (92), 0 (80)

We will aim for a balanced distribution where each agent gets approximately the same number of items and maximizes their total valuation.

Allocation:
1. Assign the highest value item for each agent first.
2. Distribute remaining items to optimize total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 81)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 93)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 49)
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 80)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 92)
6. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 77)
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 65)
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 58)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items with consideration for their valuations.
