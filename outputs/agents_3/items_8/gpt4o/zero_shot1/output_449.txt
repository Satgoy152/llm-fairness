Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  82  79  99  40   0  46  34
1  46  86  72  24   8  56  68  80
2  15  43  89  93  86  99   2   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A commonly used approach is to apply a form of the Hungarian algorithm or any other optimization method to achieve a balanced allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [87, 82, 79, 99, 40, 0, 46, 34]
- Agent 1: [46, 86, 72, 24, 8, 56, 68, 80]
- Agent 2: [15, 43, 89, 93, 86, 99, 2, 4]

The goal is to allocate the items in a way that is fair, which often means maximizing the minimum value received by any agent or balancing the total values received by each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation that attempts to balance the values:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to agents that value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Continue allocating items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Allocating the items:

- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (value 99).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 2 (value 99).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 (value 86).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 2 (value 89).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 1 (value 68).
- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (value 87).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 2 (value 86).
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 1 (value 80).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
