Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  43  79  54  87  39  45  98
1  39   7  20  36  41  58   1  57
2  43  24  46  13  53  52  76  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent. The goal is to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction or utility of each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, we can try to allocate items in a way that each agent gets roughly equal value or satisfaction. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, 4, and 7, we can allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has relatively higher values for items 3, 5, and 7. However, item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0. We can allocate items 1, 5, and 6 to Agent 1, as items 1 and 6 have the least value for the other agents.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 can be allocated the remaining items. We can give items 3 and 6 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values item 6 highly, and item 3 is not highly valued by the other agents.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Agent 1: 1, 5
- Agent 2: 3, 6

However, upon counting, we see that this allocation does not result in each agent getting an integer number of items. Let's revise:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated items 0, 2, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated items 1, 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocated items 3, 4, 6.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
