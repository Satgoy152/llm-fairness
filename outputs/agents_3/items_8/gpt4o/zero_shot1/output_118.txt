Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  77  60  37  43  98  77  46
1  66  76  81  89  22  62  89  85
2  99  14  34  61  60   4  80  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 4 77 60 37 43 98 77 46]
 [66 76 81 89 22 62 89 85]
 [99 14 34 61 60  4 80 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing total valuation, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it most. Let's do that step by step:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most and allocate the item to them.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Confirm that all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method to the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 99 (highest).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 77 (highest).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 81 (highest).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 43 (highest).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 98 (highest).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 85 (highest).

Now, let's distribute these items among the agents:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: [0]

Finally, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": [0]
}
```
