Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  86  68  19  98  54  73  73
1  19  14  39  78  88  19  52  66
2  56   0  21   4  51  71  76  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item. However, to ensure fairness, we should also consider the overall distribution of items among agents.

Let's follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **List each agent's highest-valued items**:
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 4, 1, and 0.
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 4, 3, and 7.
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 6, 5, and 0.

2. **Prioritize items with the highest valuations and assign them to the corresponding agents, ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items**.

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 0
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 7
   - Agent 2: Items 5, 6, 1, 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least 2 items, and the total valuation is relatively balanced.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 6, 1, 2]
}
```
