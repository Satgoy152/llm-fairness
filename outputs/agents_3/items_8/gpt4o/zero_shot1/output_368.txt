Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  19  46  25  10  57  55  52
1  50  79  65  53  22  26  71   4
2  58  23  41   3  54  99  13  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's review the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [22, 19, 46, 25, 10, 57, 55, 52]
Agent 1: [50, 79, 65, 53, 22, 26, 71, 4]
Agent 2: [58, 23, 41, 3, 54, 99, 13, 40]
```

We can use a simple approach to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there are conflicts (i.e., one agent is assigned too many items), adjust the allocation to balance the number of items each agent gets.

Let's begin by allocating each item to the agent with the highest value for that item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (58)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (79)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (65)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (53)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (54)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (99)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (71)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (52)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 4 items
- Agent 2: 3 items

To balance this, we could adjust by moving items between agents while considering the total value:

- Agent 1 could pass item 6 (valued at 71 by Agent 1, but only 13 by Agent 2) to Agent 0 (valued at 55).

Revising the allocation, we get:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (58)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (79)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (65)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (53)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (54)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (99)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (55)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (52)

This revised allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 3 items

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
