Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  55  48   8  79  71   5   7
1  52  73  56  90  83  82  93  75
2   6  75  92  12  91  77  72  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. We'll use the concept of maximizing the sum of an agent's assigned items' values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the agents' top preferences:

- Agent 0: Highest values are for items 4 (79), 5 (71), and 1 (55).
- Agent 1: Highest values are for items 6 (93), 3 (90), and 5 (82).
- Agent 2: Highest values are for items 2 (92), 4 (91), and 7 (90).

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total value, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0:
   - Assign items with high values: 4 (79), 1 (55)

2. Agent 1:
   - Assign items with high values: 6 (93), 3 (90)

3. Agent 2:
   - Assign items with high values: 2 (92), 7 (90)

We still have items 0 and 5 unallocated:

- Item 0 (56) has a high value for Agent 0.
- Item 5 (82) has a high value for Agent 1.

Based on the remaining values, we can allocate these as follows to balance the distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that maximize their preferences and all items are allocated.
