Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  36  82  42  40  97  93  12
1  74  15  53  29  48  14  36  81
2  87  49  35  62  91  46  88  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 36 82 42 40 97 93 12]
 [74 15 53 29 48 14 36 81]
 [87 49 35 62 91 46 88 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 14, 36, 82, 42, 40, 97, 93, 12
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** 74, 15, 53, 29, 48, 14, 36, 81
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** 87, 49, 35, 62, 91, 46, 88, 46

### Allocation Strategy

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (87)
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (49)
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (82)
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (62)
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (91)
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (88)
- **Item 7:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (81)

### Fair Allocation

Based on the highest valuations, each agent should receive a fair share of items:

- Agent 0: Item 2, Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 0, Item 1, Item 3, Item 4, Item 6

### JSON Output

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuation, and each agent receives a fair share of items.
