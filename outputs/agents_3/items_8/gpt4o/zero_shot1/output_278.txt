Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  77  39  79  69   9  40  36
1  90  32  83  64  27  58  31  31
2  12  29  18  15  65  10  96  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will use a greedy approach, considering the highest valuations first.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. Look at the highest valuations across all agents and items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on these valuations, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets a reasonable share.

Starting with the highest valuations:

- Agent 2 values item 6 at 96.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 90.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 83.
- Agent 0 values item 3 at 79.
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 77.
- Agent 2 values item 7 at 68.
- Agent 2 values item 4 at 65.
- Agent 1 values item 5 at 58.

Allocating the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 2 gets items 6, 7, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 4]
}
```
