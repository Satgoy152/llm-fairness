Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  57  84  82  45  17   3  57
1  41   6  49  48  99  12  88  83
2  65  79  90   5  68  43  15  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0, so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is the next highest for Agent 0, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 receives items: [2, 3]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Item 6 is the next highest for Agent 1, so assign item 6 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 receives items: [4, 6]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 2, so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Item 0 is the next highest for Agent 2, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Item 7 is the next highest for Agent 2, so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
   - Item 5 is also assigned to Agent 2 to ensure all items are allocated.
   - Agent 2 receives items: [0, 1, 5, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
