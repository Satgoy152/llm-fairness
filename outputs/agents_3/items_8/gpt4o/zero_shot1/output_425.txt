Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  24  15  44  79  22  67  32
1  24  17  51  60  84  17  17  17
2  81  13  12  16  84  45  29  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. The goal is to achieve a balanced distribution that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high value for items 4, 6, and 3.
- Agent 1 has high value for items 4 and 3.
- Agent 2 has high value for items 0 and 4.

To ensure fairness, we will try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's propose the following allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value it highly, but Agent 1 values item 3 as well, allowing us to distribute more valuable items overall.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 for the same reason.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it highly and no other agent values it as much.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly and it allows Agent 0 to have a valuable item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than the other agents.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a relatively higher valuation compared to Agent 1 for that item.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as it balances out the number of items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as this allows for allocation of all items fairly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items while maximizing the total valuation based on their preferences.
