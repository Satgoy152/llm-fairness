Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  45  68   7   8  63   5   6
1  21  54  20  80  41  70  14  39
2  38  24  73   7  96  66  43  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Let's do the allocation step-by-step:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (68), Item 1 (45), Item 5 (63)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 first, as it has the highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (80), Item 5 (70), Item 1 (54)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (96), Item 7 (82), Item 6 (43)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for Agent 2.

4. **Continue Allocation**:
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1, as it's the second highest value item for Agent 1 and still available.
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2, as it's the second highest value item for Agent 2 and still available.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it's the next highest value item for Agent 0 and still available.

5. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 6 are left. Allocate them such that valuations are kept fair.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2, as it has a higher valuation than the remaining items.
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1, as it has a higher valuation than the remaining options.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [4, 7, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items with the highest possible value to them, given the constraints, and all items are allocated fairly.
