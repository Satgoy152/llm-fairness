Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  41   9  75  82  46  75  10
1  46  86  70  41  34  88   3  60
2  31  21   7  45  51  65  68  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to distribute them in a manner that optimizes the overall satisfaction for each agent. We will aim to balance the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly (82) and item 3 (75).
   - Allocate item 4 and item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (88) and item 1 (86).
   - Allocate item 5 and item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 7 highly (93).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items (0, 2, 6):**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 (75) and item 0 (22).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (46) and item 6 (3).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 (68) and item 0 (31).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (68), item 0 to Agent 1 (46), and item 2 to Agent 0 (9).

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, with each agent receiving items that offer them a relatively high total value.
