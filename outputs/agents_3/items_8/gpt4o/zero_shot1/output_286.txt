Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  12  47  53  48  75  43  96
1  49   1  92  56  84   9  47  27
2  88  76  16  50  35  82  67  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations for the items. Ideally, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:  
   - Highest valued items: 7 (96), 5 (75), 0 (64)
   
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:  
   - Highest valued items: 2 (92), 4 (84), 3 (56)
   
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:  
   - Highest valued items: 0 (88), 7 (81), 5 (82)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: We'll allocate items 7, 5, and 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: We'll allocate items 2, 4, and 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: We'll allocate items 6 and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 0],
    "1": [2, 4, 3],
    "2": [6, 1]
}
```
