Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  56  56  26  62  40  40  88
1  91  10  85  18  20  44  46  80
2  67  40   6  93  94  90  84  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 10 85 18 20 44 46 80]
 [67 40  6 93 94 90 84 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent might receive for each item.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the sum of values is maximized while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

The valuations given are:

```
Agent 0: [31, 56, 56, 26, 62, 40, 40, 88]
Agent 1: [91, 10, 85, 18, 20, 44, 46, 80]
Agent 2: [67, 40, 6, 93, 94, 90, 84, 25]
```

A possible allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated is:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [1, 2], since these items provide relatively high value for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [0, 7], as they provide high value for this agent.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [3, 4, 5, 6], which are highly valued by this agent.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents and each agent receives items that provide them with the highest possible value.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
