Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  21  54  35  25  71  46   4
1  35  96  59  84  46  63  64  38
2  13  43  82  33  28  52  59  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 8 items and 3 agents, some agents may receive more than others).

Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: 
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (77)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (96)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (82)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (84)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (46)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (71)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (64)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (39)

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 5 (valuations 77, 71)
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 6 (valuations 96, 84, 46, 64)
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 7 (valuations 82, 39)

3. **Review to ensure an optimal distribution**:
   - Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 148.
   - Agent 1 receives items with a total valuation of 290.
   - Agent 2 receives items with a total valuation of 121.

This distribution ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly while maintaining fairness across the allocation.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```
