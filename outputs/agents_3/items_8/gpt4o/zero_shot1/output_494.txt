Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  46  30  18   6  88   8  84
1  40  96  44  64  14  20  13  17
2   6  38  71  50  32  21  35  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This often involves assigning items to the agent who values them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the highest value for each item among the agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item and adjust allocations if necessary.

Following this approach:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (36)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (71)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (64)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (32)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (88)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (35)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (84)

Now, distribute the items fairly ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4, 6]

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
