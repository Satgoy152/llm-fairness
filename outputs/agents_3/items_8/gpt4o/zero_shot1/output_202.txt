Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7   4  47  38  61  86   2  76
1  65  24  60  22   3  81  70  60
2  80   8   2  68  82  66  36  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7  4 47 38 61 86  2 76]
 [65 24 60 22  3 81 70 60]
 [80  8  2 68 82 66 36 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 86).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 65).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 82).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 38).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 60).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 8).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value 70).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 42).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [4, 1, 7]
}
```
