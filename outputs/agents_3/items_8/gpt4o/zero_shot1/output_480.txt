Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  10  90  46  90  71  43  90
1  46  97   2   5  17  51  80  48
2  57  44  54  77  23  10  89  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 97  2  5 17 51 80 48]
 [57 44 54 77 23 10 89 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring an integer number of items is allocated to each agent. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [80, 10, 90, 46, 90, 71, 43, 90]
- Agent 1: [46, 97, 2, 5, 17, 51, 80, 48]
- Agent 2: [57, 44, 54, 77, 23, 10, 89, 60]

We aim to distribute the items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their values, taking into account the total value an agent can achieve.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring each agent gets a fair share overall.

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 90)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 90)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 90)

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 97)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 80)

- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 77)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 57)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 10)

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 4, 7] with total value 270
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 6] with total value 177
- Agent 2 receives items [3, 0, 5] with total value 144

This is one possible fair allocation. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 0, 5]
}
```
