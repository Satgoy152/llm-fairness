Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   6   6  85  98  97  21  81
1  80  92  53  83  89  40  69  64
2  61  22  21  53  44  16   0  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations:** 
   - Agent 0: [99, 6, 6, 85, 98, 97, 21, 81]
   - Agent 1: [80, 92, 53, 83, 89, 40, 69, 64]
   - Agent 2: [61, 22, 21, 53, 44, 16, 0, 70]

2. **Determine the value for each item for each agent** and identify which agent values each item the most:
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (99)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (92)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (53)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (85)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (98)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (97)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 1 (69)
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 0 (81)

3. **Assign items optimally to agents:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 4, 5, 7.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 6.
   - Agent 2 does not receive any items because their valuations are the lowest for all items.

4. **Check the total number of items allocated:** The allocation must sum to 8 items, which it does in this case (5 items to Agent 0 and 3 items to Agent 1).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": []
}
```
