Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  98  85  47  23  87  15  93
1  55  64  12  81   4  35  96  78
2  33  28  64   5  15  31  27  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to consider the agents' valuations of the items and aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can begin by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, then adjust to ensure each agent receives items.

Let's calculate the highest value each agent ascribes to any item and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: 
   - Item 1: 98
   - Item 7: 93
   - Item 2: 85
   - Item 5: 87

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**:
   - Item 6: 96
   - Item 3: 81
   - Item 0: 55
   - Item 7: 78

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**:
   - Item 2: 64
   - Item 7: 41
   - Item 5: 31
   - Item 0: 33

Let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and all items are distributed:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 (55) values it more than Agent 0 (39) and Agent 2 (33).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 (98) values it more than Agent 1 (64) and Agent 2 (28).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 (85) values it more than Agent 1 (12) and Agent 2 (64).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 (81) values it more than Agent 0 (47) and Agent 2 (5).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 (23) values it more than Agent 1 (4) and Agent 2 (15).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 (87) values it more than Agent 1 (35) and Agent 2 (31).
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 (96) values it more than Agent 0 (15) and Agent 2 (27).
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 (93) values it more than Agent 1 (78) and Agent 2 (41).

Given this allocation, we can summarize it in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": []
}
```

All 8 items are allocated among the agents, ensuring fairness based on their highest valuations.
