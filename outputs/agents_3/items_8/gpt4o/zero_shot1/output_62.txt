Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  54   0  90  91  23  38  47
1  91  59  49  67  96  46  95  25
2  87   5   7  66  61  20  45  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, while ensuring all items are allocated. One possible way to approach this is to assign items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start with assigning the highest value items to each agent, ensuring no agent receives more than one item initially.
2. Continue to assign remaining items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (90) and item 4 (91).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (91) and item 6 (95).
- Agent 2 has relatively high valuations for other unassigned items such as item 7 (48).

Following this logic, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, and 7

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
