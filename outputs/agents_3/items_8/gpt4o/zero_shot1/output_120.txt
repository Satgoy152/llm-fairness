Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  30  46  48  59  25  60   6
1  49  67  69  56  73   9  84  80
2  52  39  96  28  18  76  15  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, one approach is to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent has an integer number of items. This can be approached by allocating items in a way that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. Let's allocate the items:

### Step 1: Determine Total Value for Each Agent
Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:
- Agent 0: 38 + 30 + 46 + 48 + 59 + 25 + 60 + 6 = 312
- Agent 1: 49 + 67 + 69 + 56 + 73 + 9 + 84 + 80 = 487
- Agent 2: 52 + 39 + 96 + 28 + 18 + 76 + 15 + 48 = 372

### Step 2: Allocate Items
We need to allocate 8 items among 3 agents. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations while attempting to distribute items fairly:

1. **Agent 1 (Highest Total Valuation):**
   - Items with highest values: 6 (84), 4 (73), 7 (80)
   - Allocated items: [6, 4, 7]

2. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with highest values: 2 (96), 5 (76)
   - Allocated items: [2, 5]

3. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with highest values: 0 (38), 3 (48)
   - Allocated items: [0, 3]

### Remaining Items
Remaining items to allocate: 1

- Highest remaining value for agent 1: Item 3 is already allocated, next highest is 1 (67)
- Allocated to Agent 1: [1]

### Final Allocation
The final allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 4, 7, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share of items based on their valuations and all items are allocated.
