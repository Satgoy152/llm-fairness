Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  96  28  35  72  75  60  57
1  80  21   0   2  36   5  92  21
2  26   7   8  43  30  10  23   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common method for fair allocation is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. With three agents and eight items, each agent should ideally receive around 2-3 items.

Let's proceed with an allocation that aims to maximize total valuation while keeping the distribution balanced:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 5 (75), Item 4 (72)
   - Allocate: Item 1, Item 4

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 6 (92), Item 0 (80)
   - Allocate: Item 0, Item 6

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (43), Item 2 (8)
   - Allocate: Item 3, Item 2

This initial allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 2.

We still need to allocate items 5 and 7. Based on remaining valuations:
- Item 5: Agent 0 (75), Agent 1 (5), Agent 2 (10) -> Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 7: Agent 0 (57), Agent 1 (21), Agent 2 (9) -> Allocate to Agent 0

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness by considering both the total number of items and the valuations of the agents.
