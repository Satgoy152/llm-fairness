Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  22  70  81  57  39  58  72
1  95  83  46  14  79  69  86  43
2  54  35  22  14  79  75  96   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least a few items. Here's how we can do it:

1. Create a list of all items and their values for each agent.
2. Sort the list of items based on the highest valuation by any agent.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
4. Ensure all items are allocated by iterating through the items and assigning them to agents based on the highest remaining value.

Based on the table provided:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 32 | 22 | 70 | 81 | 57 | 39 | 58 | 72 |
| 1            | 95 | 83 | 46 | 14 | 79 | 69 | 86 | 43 |
| 2            | 54 | 35 | 22 | 14 | 79 | 75 | 96 |  0 |

Following the approach:

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 1.
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 1.
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 0.
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 0.
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 1.
6. Item 5 is most valued by agent 2.
7. Item 6 is most valued by agent 2.
8. Item 7 is most valued by agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and the maximum possible value is achieved for each agent. However, we need to ensure a fair distribution, and each agent gets a reasonable number of items. 

Allocating the items this way:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 3, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 4
- Agent 2 gets items: 5, 6

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
