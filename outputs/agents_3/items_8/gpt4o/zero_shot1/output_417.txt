Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  31  26  44  69  63  67  99
1  34  71  79  65  25  91  73   2
2  59  37  60  58  42  37  32  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. We also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Highest: Item 7 (99)
  - Second highest: Item 4 (69)
  - Third highest: Item 6 (67)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Highest: Item 5 (91)
  - Second highest: Item 2 (79)
  - Third highest: Item 1 (71)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Highest: Item 7 (97)
  - Second highest: Item 2 (60)
  - Third highest: Item 3 (58)

We need to balance these valuations to ensure each agent is fairly satisfied. Let's allocate based on the highest available value for each agent, while ensuring each item is allocated:

1. Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 99).
2. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (value = 91).
3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 58).

Now, we have allocated 3 items. The remaining items are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. We will allocate these items to balance the satisfaction across agents:

4. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 67).
5. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 69).

This covers all of Agent 0's three highest value items. With Agent 0 satisfied, we allocate the rest:

6. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 79).
7. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 71).
8. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 59).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 4],
    "1": [5, 2, 1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
