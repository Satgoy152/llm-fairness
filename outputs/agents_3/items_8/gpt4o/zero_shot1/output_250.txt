Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56   1  28  28  63  71  92  26
1  13  70  25  66  81  50  89  37
2  19  22  82  49  16  26  66  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 70 25 66 81 50 89 37]
 [19 22 82 49 16 26 66 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. We have 8 items and 3 agents, so ideally, each agent should get approximately 2-3 items. Let's proceed with a simple approach for allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 92.
   - Next highest is item 5 with a valuation of 71.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 81.
   - Next highest is item 1 with a valuation of 70.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 82.
   - Next highest is item 3 with a valuation of 49.

After this initial allocation, the remaining unallocated items are 0 and 7. We will distribute these to the agents based on maximizing their remaining valuations:

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 56.
  - Agent 1 values it at 13.
  - Agent 2 values it at 19.
  - Allocate to Agent 0.

- **Item 7:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 26.
  - Agent 1 values it at 37.
  - Agent 2 values it at 55.
  - Allocate to Agent 2.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
