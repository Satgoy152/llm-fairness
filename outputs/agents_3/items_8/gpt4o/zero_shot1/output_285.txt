Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  13  14  50  66  71   8  48
1   3  97  75  67  84  23  32  95
2  58  36  89  47  18  80  34   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 36 89 47 18 80 34  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items. There are 8 items and 3 agents, so ideally, each agent should receive approximately 2-3 items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 38, 13, 14, 50, 66, 71, 8, 48
- Agent 1: 3, 97, 75, 67, 84, 23, 32, 95
- Agent 2: 58, 36, 89, 47, 18, 80, 34, 3

Based on these valuations, let's make a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 5 (71) and 4 (66).
2. **Agent 1** has very high valuations for items 1 (97) and 7 (95).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 (89) and 5 (80).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 should get items 5 and 4, as they provide high value to them.
- Agent 1 should get items 1 and 7, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Agent 2 should get item 2 and 6, as these provide higher value to them.

Now, we have 2 items remaining (0 and 3). Let's allocate them:

- Item 0 has a higher value for Agent 2 (58) compared to the other agents.
- Item 3 has a decent value for Agent 1 (67).

Let's allocate these remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
