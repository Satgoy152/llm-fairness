Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  16  49  28  91  49  11  98
1  99  79  62  45  89  61  96  51
2  76  36  42  18  48  50  56  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 16 49 28 91 49 11 98]
 [99 79 62 45 89 61 96 51]
 [76 36 42 18 48 50 56 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Given the valuations, we can utilize a greedy algorithm to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or valuation sum.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

```
Agent 0: [45, 16, 49, 28, 91, 49, 11, 98]
Agent 1: [99, 79, 62, 45, 89, 61, 96, 51]
Agent 2: [76, 36, 42, 18, 48, 50, 56, 25]
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Assign the items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item to ensure maximum satisfaction.

2. Ensure each agent gets at least 2 items since there are 3 agents and 8 items.

### Allocation Process:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 79.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 49.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 28.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 50.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above analysis and ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.
