Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  70   6  69  96   6  89  64
1  28  89  15  25   8  14  19  63
2  18   5  56  12   7  69  22   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. Given the valuations in the table, a possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given values:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values this the most (50).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values this the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values this the most (56).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values this the most (69).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values this the most (96).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values this the most (69).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values this the most (89).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values this the most (64).

Now, let's distribute the items ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Ideally, if any agent does not receive an item, check for items with the next highest valuation and reallocate as needed.

After reviewing, we can adjust the allocation slightly to ensure fairness:

- Give item 7 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0, as Agent 1 does not have an item yet.

Following this approach, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and each item is allocated to one of the agents.
