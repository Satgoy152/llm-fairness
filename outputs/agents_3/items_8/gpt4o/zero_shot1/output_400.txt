Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  32  85  77   9  75  40  41
1  60  17  62  47  91  54  60  11
2  65  98  91  67  42  54  55  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 32 85 77  9 75 40 41]
 [60 17 62 47 91 54 60 11]
 [65 98 91 67 42 54 55 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. We'll consider both the values and the number of items each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 0, 3, 7
   - Values: 81, 77, 41
   - Total Value: 199

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: 4, 6
   - Values: 91, 60
   - Total Value: 151

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items: 1, 2, 5
   - Values: 98, 91, 54
   - Total Value: 243

This allocation considers the values each agent assigns to the items and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
