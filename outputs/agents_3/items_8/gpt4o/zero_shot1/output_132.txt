Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  36  33  79   5  80  61  35
1  18  30  80  57  12  47  28  40
2  91   6   4  33  68  13  77   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [91  6  4 33 68 13 77  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here’s how we can proceed:

1. Create a list of all items along with the valuations by each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on valuations.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Valuation by agents: [7, 18, 91] → Assign to agent 2
- Item 1: Valuation by agents: [36, 30, 6] → Assign to agent 0
- Item 2: Valuation by agents: [33, 80, 4] → Assign to agent 1
- Item 3: Valuation by agents: [79, 57, 33] → Assign to agent 0
- Item 4: Valuation by agents: [5, 12, 68] → Assign to agent 2
- Item 5: Valuation by agents: [80, 47, 13] → Assign to agent 0
- Item 6: Valuation by agents: [61, 28, 77] → Assign to agent 2
- Item 7: Valuation by agents: [35, 40, 0] → Assign to agent 1

After assigning based on the highest valuations, we have:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 6

Thus, the final allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
