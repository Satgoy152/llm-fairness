Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  62  49  24  45  57  24  20
1   0  92  99  41  47  91   2  45
2  81  52  98  22  70  64   1  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 92 99 41 47 91  2 45]
 [81 52 98 22 70 64  1 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent gets from their allocated items. We can use a simple greedy approach to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with highest values.
   - Item 1: Value 62
   - Item 5: Value 57
   - Item 4: Value 45

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with highest values.
   - Item 2: Value 99
   - Item 6: Value 2
   - Item 7: Value 45

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with highest values.
   - Item 0: Value 81
   - Item 3: Value 22

Now, let's ensure each item is only allocated once and all 8 items are allocated. We can adjust a bit to balance if necessary:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 5, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 7
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 3, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items, and each item is allocated.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
