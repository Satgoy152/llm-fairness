Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  56  39  70  76  60  60  52
1  88  63  82   0  79  68  84  44
2  21  88  24  37  53  52  44  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. This is a form of the assignment problem, which can be solved using techniques like the Hungarian algorithm. However, given the limited size, we can manually inspect and allocate items to agents to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (70) and 4 (76).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (88) and 6 (84).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (88) and 7 (71).

Now, let's ensure all 8 items are allocated:
- Remaining items: 2, 5

Distribute the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:
- Agent 0 values item 5 at 60.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 82.

Thus, the allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 2],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items such that their total value is maximized based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed.
