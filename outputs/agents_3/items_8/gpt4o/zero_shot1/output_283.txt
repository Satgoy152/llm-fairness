Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  76  39  37   7  44  18  26
1  74  56  35  58  17  47  76  44
2  53  67   6  17  53  73  52  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a reasonably balanced set of items. We will consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute items so that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 7, 5, and 1.

To allocate fairly, we can start by assigning items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 78), item 6 to Agent 1 (value 76), and item 7 to Agent 2 (value 88).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 67) since Agent 0 already has one of their top items.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 58) and item 5 to Agent 2 (value 73).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 39) and item 4 to Agent 1 (value 17).

This way, each agent ends up with a balanced share of the items based on their valuations.

Based on this allocation, here is the JSON output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
