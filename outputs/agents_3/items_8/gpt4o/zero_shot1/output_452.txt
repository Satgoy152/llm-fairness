Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  32  62   9  72  63  26  78
1  99  73  66  22  19  46  78  33
2   4  36  90  35   1  66  69  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from the items assigned to them while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider each agent's valuations for the items and distribute them such that the overall satisfaction is balanced.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Should receive items that they value highly compared to the other agents to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Similar to Agent 0, we will allocate items to Agent 1 that they value more highly than the other agents.
3. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate items to Agent 2 based on their relative valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items: 0 (64), 4 (72), and 7 (78).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items: 0 (99), 6 (78), and 2 (66).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items: 5 (66), 2 (90), and 7 (72).

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the valuations:

1. Assign items 7 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. Assign items 0, 1, and 6 to Agent 1.
3. Assign items 2, 3, and 5 to Agent 2.

The allocations result in fairly balanced distributions based on the highest preferences and also maximize the agents' total satisfaction for their allocations.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a favorable set of items based on their valuations.
