Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  32  26  67  59  48  97  29
1  57  60  52  54  82   0  56  37
2  74  22  30  47  14  39  90  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. 

Let's evaluate the valuations for the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Items and valuations: {0: 3, 1: 32, 2: 26, 3: 67, 4: 59, 5: 48, 6: 97, 7: 29}

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Items and valuations: {0: 57, 1: 60, 2: 52, 3: 54, 4: 82, 5: 0, 6: 56, 7: 37}

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Items and valuations: {0: 74, 1: 22, 2: 30, 3: 47, 4: 14, 5: 39, 6: 90, 7: 47}

To allocate the items, we will try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (74)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (60)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (52)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (67)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (82)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (48)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (47)

Now, let's distribute these items to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```
