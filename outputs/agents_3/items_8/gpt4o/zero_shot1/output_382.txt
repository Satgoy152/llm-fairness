Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  91  84  50  99  34  20  81
1  70  13  82  48   2  34  75  86
2  52  30  95  86  34  54  45  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 91 84 50 99 34 20 81]
 [70 13 82 48  2 34 75 86]
 [52 30 95 86 34 54 45 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 99 (Item 4), 91 (Items 0 and 1)
   - Agent 1: 86 (Item 7), 82 (Item 2)
   - Agent 2: 95 (Item 2), 86 (Item 3)

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (highest valuation 99)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (highest valuation 86)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (highest valuation 95)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - After allocating the top choices, we have Items 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 remaining.
   - Agent 0 can benefit from Items 0 and 1 (both valued at 91).
   - Agent 1 can take Item 6 (value 75).
   - Agent 2 can take Item 3 (value 86).
   - Lastly, Item 5 can be allocated to Agent 2 (value 54).

By following the above steps, we ensure a fair allocation while maximizing each agent's total valuation.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 1],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
