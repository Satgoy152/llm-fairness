Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   4  12  15  32  83  36  67
1  77  50  48  14  41  15  58  43
2  71  13  61  85  74  37  98  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 50 48 14 41 15 58 43]
 [71 13 61 85 74 37 98 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

```
Agent 0: [4, 4, 12, 15, 32, 83, 36, 67]
Agent 1: [77, 50, 48, 14, 41, 15, 58, 43]
Agent 2: [71, 13, 61, 85, 74, 37, 98, 18]
```

We will try to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives some items. Keeping in mind that each agent should ideally receive an integer number of items, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [4, 4, 12, 15, 32, 83, 36, 67]
   - Highest valued items: 5 (83), 7 (67)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [77, 50, 48, 14, 41, 15, 58, 43]
   - Highest valued items: 0 (77), 1 (50), 6 (58)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [71, 13, 61, 85, 74, 37, 98, 18]
   - Highest valued items: 2 (61), 3 (85), 4 (74)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3, 4]

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's total valuation given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
