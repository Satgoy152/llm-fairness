Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  29  38  97  13   4  98   3
1  98  84  85  37   7   7   4  95
2  55  25  56  91  16  50  72  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive 3 items and the others 2 items each).

Let's consider the strategy of maximizing the sum of each agent's allocated item values:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0: Item 6 (98), Item 3 (97), Item 2 (38)
   - Allocate items 6 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1: Item 0 (98), Item 2 (85), Item 7 (95)
   - Allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2: Item 3 (91), Item 6 (72), Item 7 (76)
   - Allocate items 3, 5, and 2 to Agent 2.

After this initial allocation, ensure each agent receives a fair number of items while maximizing their total value. Adjust as necessary:

- Reallocate item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 1 has enough high-value items).
- Reallocate item 3 to Agent 0 and item 2 to Agent 2.

Now the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 4, 1

Finally, ensure a fair allocation by redistributing to balance the numbers:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 4, 5

This results in the following JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, with each agent receiving a comparable share of total valuation based on their preferences.
