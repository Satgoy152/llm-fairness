Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  10  82  27  17  21  16  37
1  90  20  81  64   8  72  60  39
2   3  63  83  31  55  31  24   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. One possible approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation by assigning items based on the highest value each agent places on them, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with the highest valuations for Agent 0: Item 2 (82), Item 0 (27)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with the highest valuations for Agent 1: Item 0 (90), Item 2 (81), Item 5 (72)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with the highest valuations for Agent 2: Item 2 (83), Item 1 (63), Item 4 (55)

Now let's distribute these items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 90)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 83)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation: 72)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation: 63)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (third highest valuation: 55)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 64)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (value: 60)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (value: 37)

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.
