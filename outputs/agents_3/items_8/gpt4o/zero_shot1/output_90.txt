Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  97  12  55  44  81  16  59
1  69   7   8   9  39  53  96  40
2  52  74  32  25  14  71  65  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 97 12 55 44 81 16 59]
 [69  7  8  9 39 53 96 40]
 [52 74 32 25 14 71 65 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [11, 97, 12, 55, 44, 81, 16, 59]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [69, 7, 8, 9, 39, 53, 96, 40]
- **Agent 2's valuations**: [52, 74, 32, 25, 14, 71, 65, 12]

To allocate items, let's start by assigning items to agents where they have the highest valuations compared to other agents:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 97, which is the highest valuation for any item by any agent, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is the highest remaining valuation, assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 69, which is the highest remaining valuation, assign item 0 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 81, which is the next highest remaining valuation, assign item 5 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 32, which is the highest remaining valuation by Agent 2, assign item 2 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 39, which is higher than the other agents, assign item 4 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 55, which is higher than the other agents, assign item 3 to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 59, which is higher than the other agents, assign item 7 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 3, 7],
    "1": [6, 0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
