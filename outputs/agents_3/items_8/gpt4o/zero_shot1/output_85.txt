Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  65  27  29  65  87  51  48
1   4  21  82  30  38  11  79  81
2  54  82  89  10  53  11  23  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. A possible approach is to use a method like the "maximum sum allocation" or "envy-free allocation," ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is balanced.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the valuations:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**  
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 0, 1, and 4 (all valued at 65).
   - Agent 1: Highest value is item 2 (valued at 82).
   - Agent 2: Highest value is item 2 (valued at 89).

2. **Allocate Unique High-Value Items:**
   - Give item 2 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (89).
   - Give item 0 to Agent 0, as it is one of the highest valued for them (65).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Valuation:**
   - Give item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 65).
   - Give item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 30).
   - Give item 4 to Agent 0 (valued at 65).
   - Give item 5 to Agent 0 (valued at 87).
   - Give item 6 to Agent 1 (valued at 79).
   - Give item 7 to Agent 1 (valued at 81).

4. **Check Total Allocations:**  
   - Agent 0 has items 0, 1, 4, 5.
   - Agent 1 has items 3, 6, 7.
   - Agent 2 has item 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on each agent's valuations, maximizing overall value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [2]
}
```
