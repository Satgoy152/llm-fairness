Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  19  11  19  65  16  41  26
1  17  52  85  53  45  93  70  49
2  28  21  76   4  98  51  19  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify which agent values each item the most and allocate the item to that agent if that agent has not already reached their maximum fair share (in this case, approximately 8 items divided by 3 agents, which is around 2-3 items per agent).

2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

3. Adjust as necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (75), Item 4 (65)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (85), Item 5 (93), Item 6 (70)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (21), Item 3 (4), Item 7 (81)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.
