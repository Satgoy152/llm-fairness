Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  47  69  96   9  80  83  29
1  44  82  33  94  55  74  92  66
2   1  52  51  90  26  11  96  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 52 51 90 26 11 96 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 3 agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least a fair share of the items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, on average, each agent should receive about \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \) items, which means two agents should get 3 items each, and one agent should get 2 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for this agent, such as items 3 and 6, where the valuations are 96 and 83 respectively. As a third item, item 5 with a valuation of 80 can be selected.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, items 1, 5, and 6 have high values for this agent, but since item 5 and 6 are already allocated to agent 0, we look for other high-value items for agent 1. Items 3, 0, and 7 with valuations of 94, 44, and 66 can be allocated to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 6 and 3 highly, but those are already allocated. Items 7, 4, and 2 are relatively high-value for agent 2 with valuations of 90, 26, and 51, respectively. However, item 7 is already taken, so we allocate items 2, 1, and 4.

After reviewing the values and allocations, the optimal allocation based on the maximum total valuation each agent can get is:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 5, and 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, and 4

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable distribution of high-value items according to their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
