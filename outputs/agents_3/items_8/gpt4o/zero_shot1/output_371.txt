Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  74  22  74  68  88  67   9
1  48  92  82  20  50  87  56  21
2  97  20  47  40  31  94  47  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least some items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (97).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (82).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (74).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (68).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (67).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (39).

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items 3, 4, 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 5, 7.

This allocation respects each agent's highest valuation for specific items and distributes the items fairly among the agents.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5, 7]
}
```
