Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  20  54  28  50  36  97  87
1  82  82  82  97  10  66  98  30
2  79  19  61  36  84  40  16  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 82 82 97 10 66 98 30]
 [79 19 61 36 84 40 16 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's consider a strategy where we allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 also has a high valuation for item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
4. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
5. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
6. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 0.
7. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
8. Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the three agents while attempting to respect their preferences as reflected in their valuations.
