Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  32  48  93  19  99  56  29
1  98  32   8   9  71   7  21  93
2  97  68  67  84  30  16  85  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 32  8  9 71  7 21 93]
 [97 68 67 84 30 16 85 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. A simple way to approach this is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and trying to distribute them evenly.

Let's evaluate the highest values each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (99), followed by item 3 (93).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (98), followed by item 7 (93).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (97), followed by item 3 (84).

A potential fair distribution could be:
- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 7.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Now let's express this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 3 agents.
