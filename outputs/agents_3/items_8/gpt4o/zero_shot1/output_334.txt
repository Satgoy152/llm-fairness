Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  89  50  38  51  13  88  89
1  25  98   0  26  55  22  47  57
2  32  29  17  96  21  74  17  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their valuations. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share, considering each agent's highest valued items first.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 3.

Based on these observations, we can try to distribute the items as follows:

- Assign items 0, 6, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 2, and 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent items that have high values for them while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
