Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  73  14  10  16   2  41  95
1  60  79   6  43  69  12  98  74
2  36   2  46  12  37  79  90  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can aim for maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 7 (95), 1 (73), and 0 (52).
   - Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 6 (98), 1 (79), and 0 (60).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 6 (90), 5 (79), and 2 (46).

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, while ensuring that no item is assigned more than once.
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for that item.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for that item.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it has one of the highest valuations for that item.
   - Continue assigning remaining items to optimize the total valuation for each agent.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 7 with valuations of 73 and 95, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, and 6 with valuations of 60, 43, and 98.
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 4, and 5 with valuations of 46, 37, and 79. 

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.
