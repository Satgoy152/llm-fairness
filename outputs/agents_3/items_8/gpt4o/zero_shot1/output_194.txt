Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  59  65  23  24  41  91  22
1  41  27  46  51  65  20  53  98
2  88  82  96  97   3  80  25  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 highly (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 7 highly (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (97).

2. **Distribute high-value items first**: Assign these items to the respective agents.

3. **Assign remaining items by maximizing individual agent values while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items**.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Has item 6.
- Agent 1: Has item 7.
- Agent 2: Has item 3.

Remaining items are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5.

- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest remaining value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.
