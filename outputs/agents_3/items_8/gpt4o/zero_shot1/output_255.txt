Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  97  18  78  73  60  62  13
1  13  10  12  51  96  75   0  87
2   7  58  59  24  83  99  67  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, we will aim to distribute the items as evenly as possible, with one agent getting 2 items and the other two agents each getting 3 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Values:**
   - For each agent, calculate the total value they would receive if they got all the items. This helps to understand the valuation preferences of each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences.

3. **Balance the Allocation:**
   - Adjust the allocation to ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items, attempting to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's the allocation process:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valuation items: 1 (97), 0 (95), 3 (78)
  - Allocate items [1, 0, 3] to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valuation items: 4 (96), 7 (87), 5 (75)
  - Allocate items [4, 7, 5] to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Remaining items: 2 (59), 6 (67)
  - Allocate items [2, 6] to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with Agent 0 and Agent 1 receiving 3 items each, and Agent 2 receiving 2 items, thus distributing all 8 items fairly among the agents.
