Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  86   6  58   4  74  69   5
1   5  61  92  14  22  89  39  65
2   0  13  84  71  47  14  48  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents by assigning items according to their valuations. A simple way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 0
   - Assign to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Assign to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 2 values it at 84
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 71
   - Assign to Agent 2

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - Assign to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 89
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - Assign to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Assign to Agent 0

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 65
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Assign to Agent 1

With these assignments, we ensure that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
