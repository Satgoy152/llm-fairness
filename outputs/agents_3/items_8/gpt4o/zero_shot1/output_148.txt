Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  63  68  70   5  96   4   6
1  21  14  57  87  63  16  65  41
2  35  76  56  50  66  40   6  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets high-valued items according to their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value items 5 and 3 highly (96 and 70 respectively).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (87) and item 2 (57).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (76) and item 4 (66).

Given that there are 3 agents and 8 items, a fair allocation might involve each agent getting approximately 2-3 items.

Here's a tentative allocation strategy:
- Allocate high-value items according to each agent's preference.
- Ensure each agent receives at least 2 items.
- Adjust for any imbalances to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: [0 (35), 5 (96)] - High preference
- **Agent 1**: [2 (57), 3 (87)] - High preference
- **Agent 2**: [1 (76), 4 (66)] - High preference

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We still have items 6 and 7 to allocate:
- **Agent 0**: Get item 6 (4) - balancing allocations
- **Agent 2**: Get item 7 (30) - balancing allocations

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share of items based on their valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
