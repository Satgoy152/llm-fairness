Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7   8  28  36  32  97  36  40
1  65  28  50  47  15  95  38  79
2  69  58  88  92  85  84  52  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7  8 28 36 32 97 36 40]
 [65 28 50 47 15 95 38 79]
 [69 58 88 92 85 84 52 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [7, 8, 28, 36, 32, 97, 36, 40]
- Agent 1: [65, 28, 50, 47, 15, 95, 38, 79]
- Agent 2: [69, 58, 88, 92, 85, 84, 52, 78]

One potential strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them the most. However, we must ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (69)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (58)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (88)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (92)
5. Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (85)
6. Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
7. Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (38)
8. Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (79)

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. We can reassign item 0 from Agent 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 does not have any items yet, and Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 0.

Reassign item 6 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation, as Agent 1 has items 7 and 6.

Now, all agents have at least one item, and the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 3, 4

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
