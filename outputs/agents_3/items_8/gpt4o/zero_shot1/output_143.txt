Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  53  60  61  68   8  86  28
1  85  46  55  75  31  19  16  50
2   2  52  96  33  51  65   6   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Since we have three agents and eight items, a possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 based on their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items that Agent 2 values highly, given the constraints.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valued items based on Agent 0's preferences are items 6 (86), 4 (68), and 3 (61).
- **Agent 1:** Highest valued items based on Agent 1's preferences are items 0 (85), 3 (75), and 2 (55).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valued items based on Agent 2's preferences are items 2 (96), 5 (65), and 1 (52).

Now, let's assign items to each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least two items (since 8 items/3 agents = 2.67, rounding down):

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 86).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 68).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 85).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 75).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 96).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 65).

Now we have two items left (items 1 and 7) to allocate:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 53).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 50).

Thus, each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed, maximizing the value received by each agent given their preferences.
