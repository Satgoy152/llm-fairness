Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  74   2  86  83  50  84   3
1  52  68  34  37  36  81  36  39
2  70  83   9  67  31   3  68  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least some items, and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying which agent values each item the most, and prioritize those allocations.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 70.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 83.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 34.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

After reviewing the allocations and ensuring each agent gets a fair share, the final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total valuation is maximized according to the agents' highest preferences per item.
