Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  12  71  23  67  55   7  14
1  57  10  21  62  78   3  47  42
2  71   1  85   1  90  86  39   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest values: Item 2 (71), Item 4 (67), Item 5 (55)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest values: Item 4 (78), Item 3 (62), Item 0 (57)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest values: Item 4 (90), Item 2 (85), Item 5 (86)

To distribute the items fairly, we can proceed as follows:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2 (value 71)
   - Agent 1 gets Item 4 (value 78)
   - Agent 2 gets Item 5 (value 86)

2. Allocate remaining items to balance the distribution and maximize overall satisfaction:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 57)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 12)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 62)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 39)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (value 14)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair number of items with consideration to their valuations.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 7],
    "1": [4, 0, 3],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
