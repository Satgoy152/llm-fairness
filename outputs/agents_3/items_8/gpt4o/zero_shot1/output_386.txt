Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  42  85  80  36   8   7  97
1  57  98  70  68  24  72  80  24
2  14  90  81  11  57  80  56  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will consider the highest valuations for each item and distribute them accordingly, ensuring a balanced approach if possible.

Let's evaluate each agent's preferences and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:**
   - Item 7: 97
   - Item 2: 85
   - Item 3: 80

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:**
   - Item 1: 98
   - Item 6: 80
   - Item 2: 70 (second highest)

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations:**
   - Item 1: 90 (second highest)
   - Item 5: 80
   - Item 2: 81

Now, let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 7 (97)
  - Item 2 (85)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 1 (98)
  - Item 6 (80)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 5 (80)
  - Item 2 (81) - Note: This item is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 2, so it's best to allocate it to Agent 2 who has fewer high-value options.

Now, we still have items 0, 3, 4 to allocate. Let's distribute them considering remaining high values:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 3 (80)
  - Item 0 (69)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 4 (57)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
