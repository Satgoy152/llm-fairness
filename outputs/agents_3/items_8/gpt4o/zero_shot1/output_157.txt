Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  94  64  38  13  56  16  29
1   1  72  74  36  84  39  35  55
2   8  48  64   1  56  74  28  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach to this problem is the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs, but for simplicity, I'll aim for a fair and balanced distribution based on the given valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value items 0 and 1 the most, at 69 and 94 respectively.
2. **Agent 1** values items 4 and 2 highly, at 84 and 74 respectively.
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 and 7 highly, at 74 and 75 respectively.

Now, let's assign the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest remaining value for them.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high value for it (35).

Given these considerations, here's a fair allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable value based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
