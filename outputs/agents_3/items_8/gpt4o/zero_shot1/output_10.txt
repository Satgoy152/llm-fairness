Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  49  74  72  33  46  25  63
1  89  50  55  89  44  40  23  54
2   9  94  27  85  14  57  24  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Let's consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Here's one possible allocation:
- Agent 0 seems to value item 0 quite highly (97), so it makes sense for them to receive it.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (89), so they can have that item.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (94), so they can receive that item.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items in a way that balances out the total number of items each agent receives.

Considering the next highest values:
- Agent 0 can also receive item 2 (74).
- Agent 1 can take item 7 (54).
- Agent 2 can take item 5 (57).

For the remaining items:
- Agent 0 could take item 4 (33).
- Agent 1 can take item 6 (23).

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations. Now let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 7, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their preferences.
