Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  94  96  89   9  40  75  35
1  88  11  75  62  83  60  43   6
2  95  42  60  89   6  17  10  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use an approach that considers the overall highest value for each item, assigning it to the agent who values it most. We will ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 95 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 2 values it at 89 (tie)
   - Agent 1 values it at 62
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (arbitrarily breaking the tie in favor of Agent 0)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 83 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 60 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 2 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now we have allocated all items. Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 4, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 7

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```
