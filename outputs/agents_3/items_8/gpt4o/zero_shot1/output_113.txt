Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  25  85  37   7  25  28  69
1  92  40  90  50  46  97  47   9
2  14  53  47  44  91  48  49  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for item 2 (85) and item 7 (69).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for item 5 (97), item 0 (92), and item 2 (90).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for item 4 (91) and item 1 (53).

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation while Ensuring Fairness**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 97).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 92).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 85) since Agent 1 already has two high-value items.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 91).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 69).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 53).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 50) as it provides a reasonable value and balances the number of items.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 49) to provide a fair item count and good value.

3. **Check Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [5, 0, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items [4, 1, 6]

4. **Confirm Total Item Count**: The total count is 8, which matches the number of available items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5, 0, 3],
    "2": [4, 1, 6]
}
```
