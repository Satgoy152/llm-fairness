Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  94  97  27  21  19   0   9
1  55  66  77  62  88  54  72  61
2  49  90  57  12  86   9  47  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 90 57 12 86  9 47 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Assign high-value items:** Start by looking for items where one agent has a significantly higher valuation than the others and assign those items to that agent.
2. **Balance the total value:** Try to ensure that the total value assigned to each agent is relatively balanced.

Let's examine the table and make allocations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: Value 5 (not a high value compared to others)
  - Item 1: Value 94 (highest for agent 0, but agent 2 values it at 90)
  - Item 2: Value 97 (highest value across all agents, assign to agent 0)
  - Item 3: Value 27 (lower value for agent 0)
  - Item 4: Value 21 (lower value for agent 0)
  - Item 5: Value 19 (lower value for agent 0)
  - Item 6: Value 0 (agent 0 has no value)
  - Item 7: Value 9 (lower value for agent 0)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: Value 55 (highest value for agent 1)
  - Item 1: Value 66 (lower than agent 0's 94 and agent 2's 90)
  - Item 2: Value 77 (lower than agent 0's 97)
  - Item 3: Value 62 (highest for agent 1)
  - Item 4: Value 88 (highest value across all agents, assign to agent 1)
  - Item 5: Value 54 (highest for agent 1)
  - Item 6: Value 72 (highest for agent 1)
  - Item 7: Value 61 (lower value for agent 1)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0: Value 49 (lower than agent 1's 55)
  - Item 1: Value 90 (close to agent 0's 94, assigning to agent 2 to balance)
  - Item 2: Value 57 (lower than agent 0's 97)
  - Item 3: Value 12 (lower than agent 1's 62)
  - Item 4: Value 86 (close to agent 1's 88, but assigned to agent 1 for balance)
  - Item 5: Value 9 (lower than agent 1's 54)
  - Item 6: Value 47 (lower than agent 1's 72)
  - Item 7: Value 94 (highest for agent 2, assign to agent 2)

Based on this analysis, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize individual valuations while trying to distribute the total value fairly among the agents.
