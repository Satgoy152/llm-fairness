Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  8  82  58  14  47  81  76  84
1  5   0  46  62  21  61  45   7
2  9  13  91   7  90   6  70  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 82 58 14 47 81 76 84]
 [ 5  0 46 62 21 61 45  7]
 [ 9 13 91  7 90  6 70 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 8 + 82 + 58 + 14 + 47 + 81 + 76 + 84 = 450
   - Agent 1: 5 + 0 + 46 + 62 + 21 + 61 + 45 + 7 = 247
   - Agent 2: 9 + 13 + 91 + 7 + 90 + 6 + 70 + 51 = 337

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 7 most at 84.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 most at 62.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 most at 91.

3. **Allocate Items to Ensure Fairness**:
   - Allocate items by considering the highest valuations first and ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

4. **Assign Items**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 1, 5, 6 (highest values: 82, 81, 76)
   - Agent 1: Allocate items 3, 4 (highest values: 62, 21)
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 0, 2, 7 (highest values: 9, 91, 51)

5. **Verify Total Allocation**:
   - Total items allocated: 3 (Agent 0) + 2 (Agent 1) + 3 (Agent 2) = 8 items

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```
