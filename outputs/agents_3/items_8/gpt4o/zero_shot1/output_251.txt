Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  18   9  27  46  66  72  30
1  65  24  45  89  57  39  64  21
2  79  19  59  86  62  59  26  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. In this scenario, with 8 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive about 2 or 3 items.

Let's consider the values each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 5, 18, 9, 27, 46, 66, 72, 30
- Agent 1's valuations: 65, 24, 45, 89, 57, 39, 64, 21
- Agent 2's valuations: 79, 19, 59, 86, 62, 59, 26, 14

A possible strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives 2 or 3 items. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 72), item 5 to Agent 0 (value 66), and item 4 to Agent 0 (value 46).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89), item 0 to Agent 1 (value 65), and item 2 to Agent 1 (value 45).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 19) and item 7 to Agent 2 (value 14).

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while distributing the items evenly.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```
