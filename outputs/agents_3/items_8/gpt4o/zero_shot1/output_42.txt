Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  26  69  77   2  44  82  89
1  83  10  46  81  52  51   0  49
2  95  74   7  17  42  97  10  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Let's consider the values each agent has for the items and try to distribute them optimally.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - 0: 20
   - 1: 26
   - 2: 69
   - 3: 77
   - 4: 2
   - 5: 44
   - 6: 82
   - 7: 89

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - 0: 83
   - 1: 10
   - 2: 46
   - 3: 81
   - 4: 52
   - 5: 51
   - 6: 0
   - 7: 49

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - 0: 95
   - 1: 74
   - 2: 7
   - 3: 17
   - 4: 42
   - 5: 97
   - 6: 10
   - 7: 10

Let's maximize the value for each agent:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it highest (95).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it highest (74).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it highest (69).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it highest (77).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it highest (52).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they value it highest (97).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as they value it highest (82).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as they value it highest (89).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total value each agent receives is maximized based on their valuations.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
