Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66   7  46  57  35   0  84  13
1  74  89  84  92  15  88  28  48
2  32  58  49  67  75  70  27  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll take a systematic approach to ensure fairness and optimal allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (Value: 84)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (Value: 66)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (Value: 92)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (Value: 89)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (Value: 88)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (Value: 81)
   - Next highest: Item 4 (Value: 75)

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: [6, 0]
- Agent 1: [3, 1, 5]
- Agent 2: [7, 4]

Now let's verify that all 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0 has 2 items: [6, 0]
- Agent 1 has 3 items: [3, 1, 5]
- Agent 2 has 2 items: [7, 4]

The total is 7 items, which means one item is missing. Let's check the remaining items:

Remaining item for allocation: Item 2

Since Agent 0 has fewer items, let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 to balance the distribution.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [6, 0, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 1, 5]
- Agent 2: [7, 4]

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1, 5],
    "2": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair distribution of high-value items.
