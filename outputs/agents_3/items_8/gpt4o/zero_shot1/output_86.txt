Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  62  79  96  96  45  48  45
1  84  11  44  75  37   4  73  76
2   3  88  85  55  61  38  63  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 11 44 75 37  4 73 76]
 [ 3 88 85 55 61 38 63 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. We can use a method such as maximizing the minimum of the sums of allocated valuations for each agent.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

   - Agent 0: 91 + 62 + 79 + 96 + 96 + 45 + 48 + 45 = 562
   - Agent 1: 84 + 11 + 44 + 75 + 37 + 4 + 73 + 76 = 404
   - Agent 2: 3 + 88 + 85 + 55 + 61 + 38 + 63 + 43 = 436

2. Allocate items to maximize fairness, aiming to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

After considering the valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4 (Total value: 91 + 96 + 96 = 283)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6, 7 (Total value: 11 + 73 + 76 = 160)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5 (Total value: 85 + 38 = 123)

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

The allocations in the specified JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
