Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  35  41   0  62  89  41  65
1  20  49  13   1  81  76  86  32
2  76  19   5  33  92  13  57  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76 19  5 33 92 13 57 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [31, 35, 41, 0, 62, 89, 41, 65]
Agent 1: [20, 49, 13, 1, 81, 76, 86, 32]
Agent 2: [76, 19, 5, 33, 92, 13, 57, 71]
```

One possible approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring that no agent receives more items than others unnecessarily. We could aim to balance the number of items each agent receives as well, given there are 3 agents and 8 items.

1. **Assign the highest-valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 89)
   - Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 86)
   - Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 92)

2. **Continue assigning items to balance the allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 65)
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 49)
   - Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 76)

3. **Assign the remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 41)
   - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 1)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least two items.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 2],
    "1": [6, 1, 3],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is fairly based on the given valuations.
