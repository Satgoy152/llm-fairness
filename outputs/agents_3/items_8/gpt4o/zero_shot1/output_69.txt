Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  49   5  90  57  32  27  83
1  30  41  80  50  56  59  22  69
2  76  55  64  41  51  13   8  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute all 8 items among the 3 agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are:
     - Item 3 (90)
     - Item 7 (83)
   - Allocate Items 3 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - With Items 3 and 7 already allocated, the next highest value items for Agent 1 are:
     - Item 2 (80)
     - Item 5 (59)
   - Allocate Items 2 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining items for Agent 2 are:
     - Item 0 (76)
     - Item 6 (8)
   - Allocate Items 0 and 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1 and 4 are left. To balance the items fairly:
     - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (55 is a higher value for Agent 2 than others).
     - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (56 is a reasonable value for Agent 1).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 4],
    "2": [0, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, ensuring all 8 items are distributed.
