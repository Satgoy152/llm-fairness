Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34   8  34  72  50  75  69  56
1  48   9  46  87  99   0  41  50
2  66  84  66  81  90  57  90  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should strive to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are 75 (item 5), 72 (item 3), 69 (item 6).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are 99 (item 4), 87 (item 3), 50 (item 7).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are 90 (item 4), 90 (item 6), 84 (item 1).

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Satisfaction:**
   - Assign items that have the highest unique value for each agent first.

3. **Iterate to Balance:**
   - After initial assignments, iterate and adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their total valuation.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - As per the valuation matrix:
     - Agent 0 receives items with high value unique to them or not highly valued by others.
     - Agent 1 receives items with high value unique to them or not highly valued by others.
     - Agent 2 receives items with high value unique to them or not highly valued by others.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly, and no other agent values it as highly, so Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most compared to the other agents, so Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most compared to the other agents, so Agent 2 gets item 6.
- The remaining items are allocated based on the next highest values for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution.

After considering the above steps, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the total value for each agent.
