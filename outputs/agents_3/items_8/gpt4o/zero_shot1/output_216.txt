Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  91  16  47  70  37  61  72
1  84  39  95  34  73  48  89  28
2   9  54  46  13  64   3  63  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations. One approach is to use an algorithm like the "maximum Nash welfare" allocation, which tries to maximize the product of the values (or utilities) that each agent receives. However, in this case, a simpler heuristic approach can be used to ensure a reasonably fair distribution.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [89, 91, 16, 47, 70, 37, 61, 72]
Agent 1: [84, 39, 95, 34, 73, 48, 89, 28]
Agent 2: [9, 54, 46, 13, 64, 3, 63, 39]
```

Let's start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 (89)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (91)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 (95)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (47)
5. Item 4: Agent 1 (73)
6. Item 5: Agent 1 (48)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (61)
8. Item 7: Agent 0 (72)

After this initial assignment, Agent 0 has 5 items, Agent 1 has 3 items, and Agent 2 has 0 items. To be fair, we should try to ensure each agent gets at least one item. 

Let's re-evaluate the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0
2. Item 1: Agent 0
3. Item 2: Agent 1
4. Item 3: Agent 2 (instead of Agent 0, to give Agent 2 an item)
5. Item 4: Agent 1
6. Item 5: Agent 2 (instead of Agent 1, to balance the allocation)
7. Item 6: Agent 0
8. Item 7: Agent 0

Now, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5]

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
