Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  56  16  54  56  26  94  48
1  12  16  66  40  34  67   4  24
2   6  28  24  48  34   4  59  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 2-3 items.

Let's examine the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 6 (94), Item 1 (56), Item 4 (56)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 2 (66), Item 5 (67), Item 3 (40)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Item 6 (59), Item 3 (48), Item 7 (47)

We will start by assigning the items based on the highest valuations:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 94)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 66)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (value 48)

This covers three items. Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 56)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 67)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (value 47)

Now, we have allocated six items. We need to allocate the remaining two items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 41)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 34)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 0],
    "1": [2, 5, 4],
    "2": [3, 7]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items, and all 8 items have been distributed among the agents.
