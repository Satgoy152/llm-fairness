Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  80  84  43  22  45  46  19
1  10  81  89  71  48  79  25  98
2  42  80  59  57  55   9  64  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation by attempting to give them the items they value the most. Here's one way to achieve this by analyzing the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (84), Item 0 (82), Item 1 (80)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (98), Item 2 (89), Item 1 (81)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (64), Item 1 (80), Item 4 (55)

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Assign Item 0 (82) and Item 1 (80) since these are some of the highest valuations for Agent 0 and are relatively less valued by other agents compared to their top choices.

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Assign Item 7 (98) and Item 2 (89) as they are the highest valued items by Agent 1 and also higher than other agents' valuations of these items.

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Assign Item 6 (64), Item 4 (55), and Item 3 (57) as these items have relatively high valuations for Agent 2 and are less contested by Agent 0 and Agent 1.

- **Remaining Item**: 
  - Item 5 (45) can be assigned to Agent 0 as it has a moderate valuation and balances the number of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly while fairly distributing the total number of items among the agents.
