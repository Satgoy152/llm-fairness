Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  79  85  70  85  22  53  93
1  74  67  81  46  35   0  23  78
2  58  82  96  37  47  36  15   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 82 96 37 47 36 15  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by ensuring each agent receives a similar total valuation of items. One reasonable method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on maximizing their valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **List all items in order of their highest valuation by any agent.**
2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.**

Let's go through this:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (94).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (82).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (96).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (70).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (85).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (22).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (53).
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (93).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Has items [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] initially.
- **Agent 1**: Currently has no items; we will assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Has items [1, 2].

Adjust the allocation to ensure fairness:

- Move item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 4, 5, 6, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [3]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2]

This results in the following JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
