Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  76  29  43  15   0  38  35
1   2   3   6  42  89  36  42  17
2  97   2  34  93  57  68  13  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and each item is allocated to one agent.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - High values: 61 (item 0), 76 (item 1), 43 (item 3)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - High values: 89 (item 4), 42 (item 3), 42 (item 6)

- **Agent 2**:
  - High values: 97 (item 0), 93 (item 3), 84 (item 7)

Given the above, we can attempt a fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's high values while ensuring each item is allocated once.

Proposed allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 7

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 6, which collectively have high values for them.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 5, with item 4 being particularly valuable.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 3, and 7, all of which have high values for them.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
