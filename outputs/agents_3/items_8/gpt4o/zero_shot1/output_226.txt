Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  57  46  25  31  25   9  98
1  95  16  97  17  48  13  77   9
2  71   3  51  71  14  57  24  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets around the same number of items. Here's a potential approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Determine the total valuation each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Item Assignment**: Assign items to agents in such a way that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total valuation.

3. **Ensure Fairness**: Each agent should receive approximately 2-3 items since there are 8 items and 3 agents.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 66 + 57 + 46 + 25 + 31 + 25 + 9 + 98 = 357
- Agent 1: 95 + 16 + 97 + 17 + 48 + 13 + 77 + 9 = 372
- Agent 2: 71 + 3 + 51 + 71 + 14 + 57 + 24 + 94 = 385

Now, let's allocate items to agents while maintaining fairness:

- Agent 0: Assign items that maximize their valuation. Let's start with item 7 (98), item 0 (66), item 1 (57).
- Agent 1: Assign items 2 (97), item 6 (77), item 4 (48).
- Agent 2: Assign items 3 (71) and item 5 (57).

After allocating, check to ensure all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair number of items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items while trying to respect their valuations as much as possible.
