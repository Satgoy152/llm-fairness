Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  31  38  41  17  30  60  99
1  64  34  10  74  39  35  49  47
2  36  86  11  29  38  17  96  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. We can use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, giving preference to the agent who values the item the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate total valuations for each agent

- Agent 0: 77 + 31 + 38 + 41 + 17 + 30 + 60 + 99 = 393
- Agent 1: 64 + 34 + 10 + 74 + 39 + 35 + 49 + 47 = 352
- Agent 2: 36 + 86 + 11 + 29 + 38 + 17 + 96 + 52 = 365

### Step 2: Allocate items to agents

We'll allocate items based on which agent values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (77), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (86), allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (38), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (74), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (39), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (30), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (96), allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (99), allocate to Agent 0.

### Resulting allocation

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6

### JSON format

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
