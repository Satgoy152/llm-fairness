Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  47  53  60  21  49  72  71
1  81  12  56  68   3  14  86  80
2  25  80  38  51   4  29  58  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the table to find a suitable allocation:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 4
- Item 1: 47
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 60
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 49
- Item 6: 72
- Item 7: 71

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 12
- Item 2: 56
- Item 3: 68
- Item 4: 3
- Item 5: 14
- Item 6: 86
- Item 7: 80

Agent 2 values:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 80
- Item 2: 38
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 4
- Item 5: 29
- Item 6: 58
- Item 7: 80

To maximize fairness, we can initially aim to distribute the highest valued items for each agent:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 6 and 7.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 6.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 7.

Let's proceed with the allocation:
- Give Agent 0: Items 6 and 7
- Give Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
- Give Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 4, and 5

This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives based on their preferences. 

Now, let's present the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
