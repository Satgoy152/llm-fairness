Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  92  11  17  50  82  60  32
1  45  50  98  53  15  77  75  32
2   0  37  88   5  64  14  96  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A fair allocation doesn't necessarily mean equal, but rather that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation as much as possible under the given constraints.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by considering which items Agent 0 values most. The highest valuations are for items 1 (92), 5 (82), and 6 (60).

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 (98) the most, followed by item 6 (75) and item 5 (77). Since item 6 is also highly valued by Agent 0, let's initially allocate item 5 to Agent 1 and leave item 6 for Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 6 (96) and item 7 (95). Since item 6 is preferred by both Agents 0 and 2, we will allocate item 6 to Agent 2 and attempt to balance the remaining allocations.

4. **Revisiting Agent 0**: Given the allocation of item 6 to Agent 2, we assign item 1 (92) and item 3 (17) to Agent 0.

5. **Revisiting Agent 1**: Agent 1 receives item 2 (98) and item 5 (77), leaving us with items 0, 4, and 7.

6. **Revisiting Agent 2**: Give item 7 (95) also to Agent 2, as it is highly valued. 

7. **Final Allocation**: Allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent gets roughly an equal share or as fairly as possible.

After considering the valuations and optimal distribution, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly while also ensuring all items are distributed. The allocations ensure fairness based on the agent's preferences and the constraint of distributing all items.
