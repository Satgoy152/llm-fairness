Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  33  67  76   1  62  83  92
1  30  23  19  62  65  15  34  24
2  70  27  73   8  39  61   0   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 27 73  8 39 61  0  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we can use a strategy that tries to give each agent the items they value the most. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values the highest: Item 7 (92), Item 6 (83), Item 3 (76)
   - Allocate: Item 7 and Item 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values the highest: Item 4 (65), Item 3 (62)
   - Allocate: Item 4 and Item 3

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values the highest: Item 2 (73), Item 0 (70), Item 5 (61)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 0, and Item 5

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:
- Items allocated so far: [7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 0, 5]
- Remaining item: Item 1

Allocate the remaining item:
- Item 1 can be given to Agent 0, who values it at 33, which is the greatest value among the agents for this item.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [7, 6, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 0, 5]

Presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 0, 5]
}
```
