Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  34   4  40  95  28  52  77
1  68  92  73  46  32  81  45   2
2  44  63  42  52  84  21  54  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by examining the highest valuation each agent has for the items and allocate those items.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items unless there is a significantly better allocation.

Here's how the allocation might look:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (95), so let's assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (92), so let's assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most (96), so let's assign item 7 to agent 2.

Now, let's continue allocating the remaining items while considering the highest remaining valuations:

- Agent 0 also has high valuations for item 3 (40) and item 7 (77), but item 7 is already allocated, so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has item 5 (81) as the next highest valuation, so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has item 6 (54) as the next highest valuation, so we assign item 6 to agent 2.

Three items remain: 0, 2, and 5.

- Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 0 (68), so we assign it to agent 1.
- Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 5 (28), but item 5 is already allocated, so the next is item 2 (4). However, item 2 has a low valuation across the board.
- Agent 2 has item 6 (54) already allocated but item 2 (42) is also high, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.

Finally, only item 5 remains, and since it is already assigned, we distribute it to agent 1, who does not need it again.

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
