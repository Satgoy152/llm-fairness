Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  29  45  44  37  29  83  29
1   9  10  15  74  77  18  90  88
2  36  67  40  41  42  23   4  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 29 45 44 37 29 83 29]
 [ 9 10 15 74 77 18 90 88]
 [36 67 40 41 42 23  4 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will consider each agent's preferences and values for each item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that each agent's total value of received items is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 seems to value items 0 and 6 highly (77 and 83).
- Agent 1 values items 6 and 7 highly (90 and 88).
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (67).

Considering these observations, we can create an initial allocation based on the highest value preferences:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 6).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for item 0).
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (second highest value for item 7).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 1).

Now, allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 4, 5):

- Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation.
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation.
- Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation.
- Item 5: Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6, 7],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and utilizes the available items efficiently based on their valuations.
