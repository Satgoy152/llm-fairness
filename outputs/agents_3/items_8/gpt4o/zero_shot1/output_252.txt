Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39   2  60  77  91  55   0  85
1  22  72  65  86  60  49  93  98
2  57  89  87  39  16  86  58  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 89 87 39 16 86 58 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's go through the process:

1. **List the values for each item and agent:**

   - Items valued by Agent 0: [39, 2, 60, 77, 91, 55, 0, 85]
   - Items valued by Agent 1: [22, 72, 65, 86, 60, 49, 93, 98]
   - Items valued by Agent 2: [57, 89, 87, 39, 16, 86, 58, 70]

2. **Allocate items to maximize total value for each agent while ensuring fairness:**

   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Highest value items: 4 (91), 3 (77), 7 (85)
     - Allocate items 4, 3, and 7 to Agent 0

   - **Agent 1**:
     - Highest value items: 7 (98), 6 (93), 1 (72)
     - Allocate items 7, 6, and 1 to Agent 1

   - **Agent 2**:
     - Highest value items: 1 (89), 2 (87), 5 (86)
     - Allocate items 1, 2, and 5 to Agent 2

3. **Adjust allocations to ensure only 8 items are allocated:**

   We need to adjust the allocations to ensure only 8 items total are allocated. Let's balance the allocation:

   - Remove overlap and ensure each agent gets a fair share:
     - Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2]
     - Agent 1 gets items: [6, 7]
     - Agent 2 gets items: [1, 3, 4, 5]

   Splitting the items fairly and ensuring all items are allocated without any overlap, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the total value for each agent as best as possible.
