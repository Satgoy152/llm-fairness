Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  49   0  26   8  66  17   2
1   2  26  37  52  36  25   9  62
2  29  23  78  23   9  94  59  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [67, 49, 0, 26, 8, 66, 17, 2]
   - Agent 1: [2, 26, 37, 52, 36, 25, 9, 62]
   - Agent 2: [29, 23, 78, 23, 9, 94, 59, 62]

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 5 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 and 7 highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 2 and 5 highly.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Prioritize allocating items to agents who value them the most.
   - Ensure each agent gets a fair share of items.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign items based on the highest value for each item across all agents:
     - Item 0 -> Agent 0 (67)
     - Item 1 -> Agent 0 (49)
     - Item 2 -> Agent 2 (78)
     - Item 3 -> Agent 1 (52)
     - Item 4 -> Agent 1 (36)
     - Item 5 -> Agent 2 (94)
     - Item 6 -> Agent 2 (59)
     - Item 7 -> Agent 1 (62)

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations while all items are distributed.
