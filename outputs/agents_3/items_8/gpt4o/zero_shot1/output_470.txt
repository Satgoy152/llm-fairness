Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  85   8  44  34  72  57  51
1  88  82  63  55  25  78  95  11
2   3  36  82  25  52  32  42   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. This will give us an idea of how much each agent values the items overall.
2. Allocate items to agents based on a combination of maximizing individual item values and ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's calculate the total value each agent gives to all items:

- Agent 0: 69 + 85 + 8 + 44 + 34 + 72 + 57 + 51 = 420
- Agent 1: 88 + 82 + 63 + 55 + 25 + 78 + 95 + 11 = 497
- Agent 2: 3 + 36 + 82 + 25 + 52 + 32 + 42 + 7 = 279

Next, we will allocate the items while keeping in mind to provide each agent with a fair share of the total value:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Choose items with values: 85, 72, 69
   - Agent 1: Choose items with values: 95, 88, 82
   - Agent 2: Choose items with values: 82, 52, 42

2. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Agent 0: [1, 5, 0]
   - Agent 1: [6, 3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [2, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a share of items based on their valuation. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 0],
    "1": [6, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.
