Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  92  35  56  53  62   6  25
1  75  63  28  18   4  46  84  65
2  11  54   9  47  35  93  75  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 54  9 47 35 93 75 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and ensure that the distribution is balanced. We can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items. Here's one such allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1.
- Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2 highly values items 5 and 6.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent, ensuring no overlap.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuations as much as possible.

Based on the table provided, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations. The total number of items allocated is 8, as required.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
