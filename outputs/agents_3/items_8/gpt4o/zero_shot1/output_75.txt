Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  45  41  59   2  26  18  78
1  89  22  98  26  34  95  54   7
2  23   5  40  12  50  33  86  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives for the items they are assigned. The goal is to ensure each agent gets a reasonable number of items based on their preferences as indicated by their valuations. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values for Agent 0: Item 0 (94), Item 7 (78).
   - Allocate Items: 0, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values for Agent 1: Item 2 (98), Item 5 (95).
   - Allocate Items: 2, 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values for Agent 2: Item 6 (86), Item 4 (50).
   - Allocate Items: 4, 6

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items in a way that maintains fairness:

- Remaining items: 1, 3

Let's distribute these two items by considering the next highest values for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (45), Item 3 (59)
  - Allocate Item 3

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1 (22)
  - Allocate Item 1

This ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 3],
    "1": [2, 5, 1],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
