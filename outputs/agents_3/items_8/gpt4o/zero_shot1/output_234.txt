Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  75  70  63  55   5  95  61
1  29  97  57   6  58  69  58  34
2  17   2  54  12  42  81  88   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17  2 54 12 42 81 88  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we want to aim for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the valuations, we can follow a strategy to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5 and 6.

Considering the above, let's try a distribution while ensuring no conflicts and maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (88).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (88).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (97).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (81).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (70).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (58).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (63).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (34).

Now, let's verify that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on valuations and gives each agent a reasonable share.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
