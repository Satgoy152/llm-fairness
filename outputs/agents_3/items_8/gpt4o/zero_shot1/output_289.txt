Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  33   9  34  29  11   4  62
1  75  37  36  60  91  12  89  59
2  95  39  83  11  28  82  12  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations table, we can use a simple approach to allocate the items by selecting the highest value item for each agent in turn until all items are allocated.

Let's follow this approach:

1. Assign items to each agent based on their highest valuations, one at a time, while ensuring that each item is only assigned once.

2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 95.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 91.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the second most at 83.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the third most at 89.
- Agent 0 values item 7 the fourth most at 62.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the fifth most at 60.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the sixth most at 82.
- Agent 0 values item 1 the seventh most at 33.

Now, check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair number of items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 6, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
