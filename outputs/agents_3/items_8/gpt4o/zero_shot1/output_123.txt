Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  32  80  21  70  44  87  75
1  92   1  54  99  59  37  34  47
2  68  97  72  72  79  62  85  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92  1 54 99 59 37 34 47]
 [68 97 72 72 79 62 85 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2) based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's start by looking at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 32, 80, 21, 70, 44, 87, 75]
- Agent 1: [92, 1, 54, 99, 59, 37, 34, 47]
- Agent 2: [68, 97, 72, 72, 79, 62, 85, 90]

We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least two items (since there are 8 items in total and 3 agents).

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99) and item 0 (92). Give these to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (97) and item 7 (90). Give these to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (87) and item 2 (80). Give these to Agent 0.
4. For the remaining items 4 and 5, consider the next highest valuations across the agents:
   - Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (70), followed by Agent 2 (79).
   - Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (62), followed by Agent 0 (44).

To balance the distribution:
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (79).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (44).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.
