Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  86   3  50  25  21   7  11
1  44  88  19   5   9  42  25   7
2  38  58  25  43  67  90  54  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations table and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One potential approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents and items are nodes, and edges have weights corresponding to the valuations. However, as we have only a small number of items and agents, we can manually inspect the valuations and allocate items to ensure a reasonable distribution.

Let's examine the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  86   3  50  25  21   7  11
1  44  88  19   5   9  42  25   7
2  38  58  25  43  67  90  54  57
```

We can proceed by trying to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1, but since it's already allocated, we'll consider item 0 for them.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.

Let's proceed with allocation based on preferences:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Now we're left with items 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. We can distribute these items by considering remaining high valuations and ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 50).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (valued at 9).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (valued at 54).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (valued at 57).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 has items 5, 6, and 7.

We have one more item left, item 2. We can assign it to Agent 0, as they have the least number of items currently.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, and all eight items are distributed.
