Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  36  73  90  33  13  74  92
1  16  56  77   2  39  83  58  13
2  46  25  15  38  89  94  85  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple approach that aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent receives some items and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

Let's first assess the valuations for each agent and try to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives a fair share:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [47, 36, 73, 90, 33, 13, 74, 92]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [16, 56, 77, 2, 39, 83, 58, 13]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [46, 25, 15, 38, 89, 94, 85, 59]

We want to ensure that each agent gets some items and that all items are distributed. Let's assign the items in a way that attempts to maximize the satisfaction (valuation) for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Choose items with high valuations for Agent 0.
  - Items 3 (90) and 7 (92) are the highest, so allocate these to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: Choose items with high valuations for Agent 1.
  - Items 5 (83) and 2 (77) are the highest, so allocate these to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Choose items with high valuations for Agent 2.
  - Items 4 (89) and 5 (94) would be ideal, but item 5 is already taken, so choose items 4 (89) and 6 (85) instead for Agent 2.

This leaves two more items (0, 1) to be allocated. We need to ensure that all agents have a roughly equal number of items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest value for them.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as it balances the distribution and gives them another item they value reasonably well.

Thus, the final allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
