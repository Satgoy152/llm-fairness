Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  27  34  46  13  85   5  60
1  30  63  75  82  39  59  86  28
2   3  32  94  14  46  68  85  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a method that tries to distribute items to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 30 (agent 0) + 30 (agent 1) + 3 (agent 2) = 63
   - Item 1: 27 (agent 0) + 63 (agent 1) + 32 (agent 2) = 122
   - Item 2: 34 (agent 0) + 75 (agent 1) + 94 (agent 2) = 203
   - Item 3: 46 (agent 0) + 82 (agent 1) + 14 (agent 2) = 142
   - Item 4: 13 (agent 0) + 39 (agent 1) + 46 (agent 2) = 98
   - Item 5: 85 (agent 0) + 59 (agent 1) + 68 (agent 2) = 212
   - Item 6: 5 (agent 0) + 86 (agent 1) + 85 (agent 2) = 176
   - Item 7: 60 (agent 0) + 28 (agent 1) + 86 (agent 2) = 174

2. **Allocate Items to Agents Based on Their Valuations:**
   - Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no more than three, since there are 8 items and 3 agents.

3. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Value for items [5, 7] is (85, 60) = 145
   - Agent 1: Value for items [1, 3, 6] is (63, 82, 86) = 231
   - Agent 2: Value for items [2, 4, 0] is (94, 46, 3) = 143

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 0]
}
```
