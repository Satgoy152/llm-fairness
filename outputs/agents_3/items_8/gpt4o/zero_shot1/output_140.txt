Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  57   8  31  87  50  84  10
1  92  36  84  14  43  18   2  11
2  34  20  79  99  42   6  39  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their valuations, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 1.
2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 0 and a relatively high valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 3 and a moderate valuation for item 2.

A fair allocation might look like this:

- Assign items to each agent based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 4, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 5, 7]

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation respects the constraint that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
