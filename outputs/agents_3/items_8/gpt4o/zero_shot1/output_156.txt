Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34   8  26  27  77  73  29  40
1  11  85  85  19  44  58  12  56
2  18  17  11  42  52   0  47  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction. Each agent should have a reasonable distribution of high-value items as per their individual preferences, ensuring no one agent is excessively favored.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 (77) and 5 (73).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (85) and 2 (85).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (52) but agent 0 already has a higher valuation for that item, so we try to find the next best options for agent 2.

Considering these factors, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 4 and 5, as they are the highest valued by this agent.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 1 and 2, as they are the highest valued by this agent.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 3, 6, and 7. Items 3 and 6 have reasonable valuations, and item 7 is neutral, ensuring fairness in distribution.

Now, let's see if we have allocated all 8 items:

- Agent 0: 2 items (4 and 5)
- Agent 1: 2 items (1 and 2)
- Agent 2: 3 items (3, 6, and 7)

We have accounted for 7 items. To allocate the remaining item 0, we can give it to Agent 0, who has a moderate valuation for it (34), which is higher than the others.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6, 7

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
