Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  12  93  90  85  19  35  26
1  13  24  61  58  52  93  18  57
2  92  14  22   0  12  26   1  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to do this is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's start by evaluating the total valuations for each agent and attempt to allocate items based on maximizing these valuations.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item per Agent

- Agent 0: [42, 12, 93, 90, 85, 19, 35, 26]
- Agent 1: [13, 24, 61, 58, 52, 93, 18, 57]
- Agent 2: [92, 14, 22, 0, 12, 26, 1, 80]

### Step 2: Determine Initial Highest Value Allocations

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (93), Item 3 (90), Item 4 (85)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 2 (61), Item 3 (58)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (92), Item 7 (80), Item 5 (26)

### Step 3: Fair Allocation Based on High Value Priority

We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair allocation. Let's allocate the items by choosing the highest valued items for each agent in a way that balances the total number of items allocated.

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Allocate items: [2, 3, 4]

- **Agent 1**:
  - Allocate items: [5, 1]

- **Agent 2**:
  - Allocate items: [0, 7, 6]

### Step 4: Check Total Allocations and Adjust 

Ensure that a total of 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: 3 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 3 items

This makes a total of 8 items allocated, which satisfies the condition.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [0, 7, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
