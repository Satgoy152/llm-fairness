Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  22  69  32  20  56  45  72
1  31  54  31  29   2  72  16   4
2  87  89  50  44  56  73   3  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 54 31 29  2 72 16  4]
 [87 89 50 44 56 73  3 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied, considering the constraints.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [36, 22, 69, 32, 20, 56, 45, 72]
- Agent 1: [31, 54, 31, 29, 2, 72, 16, 4]
- Agent 2: [87, 89, 50, 44, 56, 73, 3, 48]

A potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 (value 87)
2. Item 1: Agent 2 (value 89)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 (value 69)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (value 32)
5. Item 4: Agent 2 (value 56)
6. Item 5: Agent 1 (value 72)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (value 45)
8. Item 7: Agent 0 (value 72)

Checking the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3, 6, 7] with values [69, 32, 45, 72].
- Agent 1 gets item [5] with value [72].
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 1, 4] with values [87, 89, 56].

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
