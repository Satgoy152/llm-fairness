Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  50  64  64  75  11  23  99
1  46  18  18  72  62  15  39  65
2  77  91  55  11  34  86  27  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. One approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes total utility while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 4 and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 1 and 5.

We'll start by giving each agent their highest valued item and then distribute the remaining items while considering their next highest preferences.

1. **Allocate each agent their highest valued item**:
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (99)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (46)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (91)

2. **Distribute remaining items**:
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 4 (75)
   - Agent 1: Next highest is item 3 (72)
   - Agent 2: Next highest is item 5 (86)

3. **Allocate remaining items based on remaining values to balance**:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (64)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (39)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (not possible as it is already allocated, so item 0 and 1 agent gets their next high value item which is item 6)

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
