Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  13  14  61  53  95  99  12
1  38  61  33  88  88  99  36  41
2  60  35  73  62  75  32   2  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 6 (99), 5 (95), 3 (61)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (99), 3 (88), 4 (88)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (73), 4 (75), 0 (60)

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total value:

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 6 (99), item 5 (95)
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 3 (88), item 4 (88)
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 2 (73), item 0 (60), item 1 (35), item 7 (71)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 7]
}
```
