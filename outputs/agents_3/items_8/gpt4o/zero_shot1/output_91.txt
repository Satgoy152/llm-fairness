Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  68  57  30  95  67  68  90
1  71   9  14  10  17  97  72  30
2  79  99  16  70  61  17  90  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71  9 14 10 17 97 72 30]
 [79 99 16 70 61 17 90 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to give each agent items that maximize their total value while ensuring each agent gets approximately the same number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent if they received all items:**
   - Agent 0: 93 + 68 + 57 + 30 + 95 + 67 + 68 + 90 = 568
   - Agent 1: 71 + 9 + 14 + 10 + 17 + 97 + 72 + 30 = 320
   - Agent 2: 79 + 99 + 16 + 70 + 61 + 17 + 90 + 88 = 520

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value within fairness constraints:**

   - **Agent 0:**
     - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 0 (93), 7 (90)
     - Allocate items 0, 4, and 7 to Agent 0

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Highest valued items: 5 (97), 6 (72)
     - Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 1

   - **Agent 2:**
     - Highest valued items: 1 (99), 3 (70), 2 (16)
     - Allocate items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 2

3. **Check total allocation:**
   - Agent 0: 3 items (0, 4, 7)
   - Agent 1: 2 items (5, 6)
   - Agent 2: 3 items (1, 2, 3)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
