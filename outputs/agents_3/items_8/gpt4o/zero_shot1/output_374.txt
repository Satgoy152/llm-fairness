Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58   8  81  93  39  74  55  69
1  40  19  69  11  68   1  18  76
2  25  95  12  56  75  75  38  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a valuable share according to their preferences. However, we also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method that balances both the total value of items each agent receives and the number of items. We can start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and distribute accordingly, trying to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least two items since we have three agents and eight items in total.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (93), and item 2 is the next highest (81).
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (76), and item 4 is the next highest (68).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (95), and items 4 and 5 are equally valued (75).

Now, let's assign based on this analysis:

- Assign items 3 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 7 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1, 5, and the remaining items to Agent 2 to ensure all items are allocated.

After considering this allocation, we can adjust slightly if needed to ensure fair distribution. Here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, considering their valuations, and every agent receives an integer number of items.
