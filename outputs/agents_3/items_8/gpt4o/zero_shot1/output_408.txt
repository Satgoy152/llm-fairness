Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  78  96  40   6  99  27  66
1  80  25  15  29  21  98  23  71
2  11  18  89  91  78   1  26  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can utilize a method called the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities each agent receives. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Determine the Valuations**: List the valuations for each agent on each item.
2. **Allocate Items**: Consider each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.
3. **Balance the Allocation**: Adjust allocations if any agent has significantly more items than others.

Let's carry out this process:

### Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation
1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 78.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 96.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 91.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 78.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 99.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 27.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 71.

### Check Allocation Balance
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4]

Currently, Agent 0 has four items, Agent 1 has two, and Agent 2 has two. To balance further, Agent 0 can give one item to another agent:

### Rebalance
- Move item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it reasonably.

### Final Allocation
Now, each agent has two or three items, which is a fair distribution given the need for integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
