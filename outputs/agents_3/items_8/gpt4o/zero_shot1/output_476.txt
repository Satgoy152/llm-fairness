Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  79  71  82  16  30  30  79
1  46  70  24  60  62  43   2  94
2  58  57  98  92  40  30  90   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is relatively balanced. One possible approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent gets, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent to ensure that each agent gets at least one item that they highly value.
2. Continue assigning items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 6

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: 83 (Item 0) + 82 (Item 3) = 165
- Agent 1: 70 (Item 1) + 62 (Item 4) + 94 (Item 7) = 226
- Agent 2: 98 (Item 2) + 30 (Item 5) + 90 (Item 6) = 218

The allocations are reasonably balanced in terms of total valuation. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
