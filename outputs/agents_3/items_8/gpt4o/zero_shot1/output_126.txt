Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  80  83  45  42  57  32  87
1  80  90  33  97  63  63  21  27
2  65  39  96  19  30  65  30  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 39 96 19 30 65 30 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value they receive, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute the items based on maximizing each agentâ€™s valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 70 + 80 + 83 + 45 + 42 + 57 + 32 + 87 = 496
- Agent 1: 80 + 90 + 33 + 97 + 63 + 63 + 21 + 27 = 474
- Agent 2: 65 + 39 + 96 + 19 + 30 + 65 + 30 + 36 = 380

Now, allocate the items to agents based on maximizing the individual item valuations for each agent:

1. Sort each agent's item valuations in descending order and allocate the highest valued items.

Following this logic, we arrive at the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 7, 2, 1 (item values: 87, 83, 80)
- Agent 1 gets items: 3, 0 (item values: 97, 80)
- Agent 2 gets items: 5, 6, 4 (item values: 65, 30, 30)

These allocations ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 6, 4]
}
```
