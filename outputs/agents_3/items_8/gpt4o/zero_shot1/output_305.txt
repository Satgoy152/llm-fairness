Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  18  10  42   7  66  54  40
1   2   3  42  13  17   5  45  81
2  14  39  52  24  57  96  29  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Here's a reasonable allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 at 2, Agent 2 at 14. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 3, Agent 2 at 39. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 42, Agent 2 at 52. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 13, Agent 2 at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 17, Agent 2 at 57. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 5, Agent 2 at 96. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 45, Agent 2 at 29. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 81, Agent 2 at 91. Assign to Agent 2.

After this allocation, we can see:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 3, 6.
- Agent 1 has no items.
- Agent 2 has items 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.

Agent 1 does not have any items, so we need to ensure fairness by adjusting the allocation. We can reassign some items to Agent 1 from Agent 2, as Agent 2 has the most items:

- Reassign item 1 from Agent 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 2 values it at 39, the lowest among its items).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 5, 7

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
