Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  94  17  76  49  10  75  70
1  34  30  73  47  88  51  31  48
2  92   3  59   3  19  15  83  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 30 73 47 88 51 31 48]
 [92  3 59  3 19 15 83 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items being allocated.

Let's evaluate the best allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (94), Item 3 (76), Item 6 (75)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (88), Item 2 (73), Item 5 (51)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (92), Item 6 (83), Item 7 (43)

Considering each agent's top valuations and ensuring a fair distribution, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (94), 3 (76), 6 (75)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 (73), 4 (88), 5 (51)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 (92), 7 (43)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their individual valuations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```
