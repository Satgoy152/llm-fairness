Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61   8  56  93  21  91  93  27
1   1  96  12  92  59  11  20  86
2  51  65  98   1   2  22  29  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives some items, while maximizing the overall satisfaction. Here's one way to do this:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued items for Agent 0 are items 3, 6, and 5 (values: 93, 93, 91). Let's give items 0 and 3 to Agent 0, as it provides a high collective value.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued items for Agent 1 are items 1 and 3 (values: 96, 92). Since item 3 is already allocated, let's assign item 1 and item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued items for Agent 2 are items 2 and 1 (values: 98, 65). Since item 1 is already allocated, let's assign item 2 to Agent 2. We'll also give items 5 and 6 to Agent 2 to balance the count of items.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share considering their valuations.
