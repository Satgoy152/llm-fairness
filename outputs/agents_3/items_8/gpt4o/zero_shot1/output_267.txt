Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  83  89  51  11   2  17  32
1  52  15  54  84  92  45  12  15
2  79  51  21  45   2  10  77  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a round-robin method based on each agent's highest-valued items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Assign each agent their highest-valued item:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (value 89).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (value 92).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (value 79).

2. **Repeat the process while avoiding already allocated items:**
   - Next highest for Agent 0 is item 1 (value 83).
   - Next highest for Agent 1 is item 3 (value 84).
   - Next highest for Agent 2 is item 6 (value 77).

3. **Continue until all items are allocated:**
   - Agent 0 can take item 3 (next highest after 2 and 1, value 51).
   - Agent 1 can take item 5 (next highest after 4 and 3, value 45).
   - Agent 2 can take item 7 (next highest after 0 and 6, value 61).

4. **Final allocation:**
   - Ensure total items allocated equals 8.

By following these steps, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the items are distributed so that the agents receive their highest-valued items as much as possible.
