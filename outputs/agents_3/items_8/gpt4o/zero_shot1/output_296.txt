Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  14  82  68  84  62  28  23
1  76   2  64  73  35  70  18  93
2  20  13  64  88  97  78   8  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [76  2 64 73 35 70 18 93]
 [20 13 64 88 97 78  8 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with high valuation: 2 (82), 4 (84)
   - Allocate items: 2, 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with high valuation: 0 (76), 7 (93)
   - Allocate items: 0, 7

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with high valuation: 3 (88), 5 (78)
   - Allocate items: 3, 5

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items to ensure all 8 items are distributed. Let's consider the remaining items 1 and 6.

- **Agent 0:** Item 1 has a valuation of 14, item 6 has a valuation of 28.
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 has a valuation of 2, item 6 has a valuation of 18.
- **Agent 2:** Item 1 has a valuation of 13, item 6 has a valuation of 8.

Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (valuation of 14) and item 6 to Agent 0 (valuation of 28) to balance the distribution.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
