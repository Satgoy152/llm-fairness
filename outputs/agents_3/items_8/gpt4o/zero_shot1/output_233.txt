Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  72  16  84   9  68  19  48
1  28  14  78  36  59  27  43  79
2  38   0  16  15  42  94  23  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent has been allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (75), so allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (72), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (78), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (84), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (59), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (94), so allocate to Agent 2.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (43), so allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (82), so allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while each agent receives an integer number of items.
