Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  85   7  46  78  31  68  55
1  28  14  73  69  98  83  49  61
2  43  48   9  93  22  89  37  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

Let's perform this allocation:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (85), Item 4 (78), Item 6 (68)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 5 (83), Item 3 (69)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 5 (89), Item 7 (50)

Allocating based on highest valuations and trying to balance the number of items:

- Agent 0 gets items 1, 6
- Agent 1 gets items 4, 5
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 3, 2, 7

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and attempts to maximize each agent's valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 2, 7]
}
```
