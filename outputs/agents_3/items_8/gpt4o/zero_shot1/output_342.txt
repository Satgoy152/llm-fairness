Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  31  96  26  60  47  54  58
1  97  65  52  72  22  81  67  28
2  50   5  25   6  35   2  56  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 31 96 26 60 47 54 58]
 [97 65 52 72 22 81 67 28]
 [50  5 25  6 35  2 56 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives a roughly fair share of the total value available. Here's one way to approach this:

### Initial Analysis
- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 4, 6, 7.
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, 5.
- **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations compared to other agents, with the highest being item 6 and item 7.

### Allocation Strategy
To ensure fairness, we can try to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations and also ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. Here, we will allocate items such that each agent gets two or three items, maximizing the total value for each agent.

### Allocation Plan
1. **Agent 0**: Items 2, 4, 7
2. **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 5
3. **Agent 2**: Items 3, 6

### Explanation
- **Agent 0** gets items 2, 4, and 7, which are among the highest valued for them.
- **Agent 1** gets items 0, 1, and 5, which are high valued items for them.
- **Agent 2** gets items 3 and 6, which, although not as high as others, are the best available for them after considering the allocations to agents 0 and 1.

### Final Allocation
Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share considering their valuations.
