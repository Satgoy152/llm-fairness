Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   5  98  48  49  28  73   6
1  91  13  99  87  19   7  94   9
2  12  26  31  99  13  50  49  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can consider the values each agent assigns to each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (98) and 6 (73).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 (99), 0 (91), and 6 (94).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3 (99).

A possible fair allocation strategy is to prioritize giving items to agents based on their highest valuations, while trying to balance the number of items each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Since Agent 0 values item 2 highly, we can assign it to them. We should also try to give them another item they value, such as item 6.
- Agent 1: Agent 1 values items 0 and 6 highly. Since item 6 is given to Agent 0, we can assign item 0 to Agent 1. It is optimal to give Agent 1 another item with reasonable value, such as item 3.
- Agent 2: Agent 2 highly values item 3, but it's allocated to Agent 1. We can give Agent 2 item 5, which they value decently.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items, and the allocation respects their valuations as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
