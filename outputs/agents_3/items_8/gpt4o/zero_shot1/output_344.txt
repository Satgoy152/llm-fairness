Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  61  27  94  54  83  63  59
1  49  97  57  41  66   1  78  12
2  95  26  12  68  63  68  17  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 97 57 41 66  1 78 12]
 [95 26 12 68 63 68 17 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items where Agent 0 has the highest valuations compared to others.
2. **Agent 1**: Do the same for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items, ensuring Agent 2 gets items they value highly.

Allocation Strategy:
- Identify the highest value items for each agent.
- Distribute based on maximizing each agent's total value.

Based on the table, we have the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3, 5, and 7.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1, 2, and 6.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 4.

Now, let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 5, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 2, 6]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
