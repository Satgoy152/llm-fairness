Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82   6  32  69  98  28  82  35
1  26  66  74   0  92  15  58  89
2  16  16  89  34  59  63  65  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82  6 32 69 98 28 82 35]
 [26 66 74  0 92 15 58 89]
 [16 16 89 34 59 63 65 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. A method to achieve this is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table:

- **Agent 0**: Values are [82, 6, 32, 69, 98, 28, 82, 35]
- **Agent 1**: Values are [26, 66, 74, 0, 92, 15, 58, 89]
- **Agent 2**: Values are [16, 16, 89, 34, 59, 63, 65, 97]

We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (82)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (66)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (89)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (69)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (98)
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (63)
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (82)
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (97)

Let's allocate based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 7

This allocation is fair as all items are assigned, and each agent receives items based on their high valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
