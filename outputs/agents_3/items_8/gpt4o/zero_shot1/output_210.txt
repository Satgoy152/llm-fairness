Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  82  64  13  82  71  59  74
1  22  69  48  90  73  99  37  14
2  60  74  80  94  11  17  42  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We can begin by considering each agent's highest valued items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent has an approximately equal share of their total potential valuation. Additionally, we aim to ensure that all 8 items are distributed among the 3 agents.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets items they value highly such as 1 (82), 5 (71), and 7 (74).
2. Agent 1 gets items like 3 (90) and 6 (37).
3. Agent 2 gets items such as 2 (80), 0 (60), and 4 (11).

This allocation is made while trying to distribute items in a way that each agent has a fair share of their high valued items. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 0, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 0, and 4.
- All 8 items are allocated, with each agent getting an integer number of items.
