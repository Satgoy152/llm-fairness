Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  59  80   2  81  72  29   8
1  19  38  22  23  12  33  12  63
2  48  21  12  76  58  57  45  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Assess the Valuations**: Analyze the value each agent assigns to each item to understand which items are most valuable to each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent. This means giving priority to items that are most valuable to individual agents.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: After the initial allocation, adjust the allocation to ensure that the total value received by each agent is balanced as evenly as possible.

4. **Ensure Completeness**: Verify that all 8 items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for items: 2 (80), 4 (81), 5 (72).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item: 7 (63).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for items: 3 (76), 0 (48).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items, trying to balance the total value:

- Item 1 could go to Agent 0 (59) or Agent 1 (38). Since Agent 0 already has high-value items, let's give it to Agent 1.
- Item 6 could go to Agent 0 (29) or Agent 2 (45). It makes sense to give it to Agent 2 to balance the allocations.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 7, 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 0, 5, 6

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [3, 0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure a fair distribution of total value while adhering to the constraints of the problem.
