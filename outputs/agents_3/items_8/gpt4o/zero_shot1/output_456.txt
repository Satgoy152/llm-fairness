Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  56  79  37  35  91  78  63
1  76  88  48  73   1  40  80  22
2  48  45  64   8  80  55  99  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 56 79 37 35 91 78 63]
 [76 88 48 73  1 40 80 22]
 [48 45 64  8 80 55 99 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the values each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0: [10, 56, 79, 37, 35, 91, 78, 63]
- Agent 1: [76, 88, 48, 73, 1, 40, 80, 22]
- Agent 2: [48, 45, 64, 8, 80, 55, 99, 70]

We can start by allocating items to agents based on their highest value preferences.

1. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 6 (99), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 5 (91), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (88), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 2** has the next highest value for item 4 (80), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 1** has the next highest value for item 0 (76), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for item 2 (79), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 2** has the next highest value for item 7 (70), so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for item 3 (37), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.

After allocation, each agent receives the following items:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [4, 6, 7]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
