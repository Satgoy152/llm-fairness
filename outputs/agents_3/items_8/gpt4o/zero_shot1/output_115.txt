Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  58   0  56  72  66  53  63
1  58  76  79  43  46  37  71  99
2  43  30  61  39  73  78  89  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 76 79 43 46 37 71 99]
 [43 30 61 39 73 78 89 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their preferences.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate High-Valuation Items**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 99 for item 7, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (89), so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (72), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance the Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it (76).
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2, who has a high valuation (78) for it.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0, who values it fairly high (56).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0, as they also have a decent valuation for it (18).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1, who values it (79).

After these allocations, each agent receives items according to their preferences while ensuring a fair distribution of the total 8 items.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
