Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  27  83  26   5  67  60   2
1  10  40  97  77  25  48  13  18
2   4  82  49  52  58  33  15  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a proposed allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.

Let's try to allocate items maximizing each agent's total valuation.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 5
  - Valuations: 83 (item 2) + 67 (item 5) = 150

- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4
  - Valuations: 77 (item 3) + 25 (item 4) = 102

- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 6, 7
  - Valuations: 4 (item 0) + 82 (item 1) + 15 (item 6) + 83 (item 7) = 184

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 6, 7]
}
```
