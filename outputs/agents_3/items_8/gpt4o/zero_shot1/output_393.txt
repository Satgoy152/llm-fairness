Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  79  14  75  29  64   6  94
1  13   1   0  68   2  44  38  32
2  13  89  41  79  56  47   6  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One way to approach this is by assigning items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items.

Let's assess the valuations for each item and allocate accordingly:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 25
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. Item 1: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 89
   - Assign to Agent 2.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 0
   - Agent 2 values it at 41
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - Assign to Agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Agent 2 values it at 56
   - Assign to Agent 2.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - Assign to Agent 0.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 38
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - Assign to Agent 1.

8. Item 7:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 2 values it at 45
   - Assign to Agent 0.

Now, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
