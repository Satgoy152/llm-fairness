Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  62  44   8  88  18  82   1
1  67  15  86  92   1  63  19  26
2  59  54   6  48  33  33  77  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the total valuation for each agent and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while all items are distributed. We can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation or trying to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's examine a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring fairness in the number of items distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [46, 62, 44, 8, 88, 18, 82, 1]
- Agent 1 values: [67, 15, 86, 92, 1, 63, 19, 26]
- Agent 2 values: [59, 54, 6, 48, 33, 33, 77, 71]

Allocate items based on maximizing the individual agent's happiness and ensuring each agent gets at least some items:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 1, 6, 7

This allocation considers the highest value items for each agent and distributes them fairly.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
