Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  99   4  10  39  23  23  37
1  94  29  37  68  35  87  46  18
2  21  72  62  45  20  67  65  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 72 62 45 20 67 65 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Create a list of all items with their valuations for each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the valuations.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's do this step by step:

1. Create a list of each item with the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 94)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 99)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (value 62)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (value 68)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (value 39)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (value 87)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (value 65)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (value 37)

2. Allocate items to the agents based on the highest valuation:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 6

3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Now, the final allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
