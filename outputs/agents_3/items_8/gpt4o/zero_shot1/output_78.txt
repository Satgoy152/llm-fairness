Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  17  80  13  70  79  83  59
1  89  76  58  57  23  56  75  50
2  30  26  53  44  41   1  90   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use a simple heuristic approach to assign items based on the preferences of the agents.

First, let's list the items with the highest valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 6: Value = 83
  - Item 5: Value = 79
  - Item 2: Value = 80

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: Value = 89
  - Item 1: Value = 76
  - Item 6: Value = 75

- Agent 2:
  - Item 6: Value = 90
  - Item 2: Value = 53
  - Item 4: Value = 41

Next, we will allocate items to each agent based on the highest values, avoiding conflicts by assigning the item to the agent who values it the most. In case of a tie, we choose to prioritize a balanced number of items among the agents.

1. **Assign item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most with 90. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
2. **Assign item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most with 89. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Assign item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most with 80. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Assign item 5**: Agent 0 values it with 79. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
5. **Assign item 1**: Agent 1 values it with 76. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
6. **Assign item 3**: Agent 1 values it with 57. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
7. **Assign item 4**: Agent 2 values it with 41. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
8. **Assign item 7**: Remaining item, assign to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

Finally, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
