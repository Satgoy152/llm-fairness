Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  20  89  18  81  35  38  79
1  38   6   7  83  20  81  71  82
2  40  65  44   9  50  23  17  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 20 89 18 81 35 38 79]
 [38  6  7 83 20 81 71 82]
 [40 65 44  9 50 23 17 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. List each agent's total valuation for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while trying to ensure each agent gets a roughly equal number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [67, 20, 89, 18, 81, 35, 38, 79]
- **Agent 1**: [38, 6, 7, 83, 20, 81, 71, 82]
- **Agent 2**: [40, 65, 44, 9, 50, 23, 17, 97]

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 67 (Agent 0)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 65 (Agent 2)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 89 (Agent 0)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 83 (Agent 1)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 0)
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 1)
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 71 (Agent 1)
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 97 (Agent 2)

### Final Allocation:
The allocation is made to ensure each agent receives a fair share while considering their highest valuations for each item:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items with respect to their valuations.
