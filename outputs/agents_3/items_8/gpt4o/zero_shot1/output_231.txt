Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  64  23   5  14  89  40  70
1  94  20  51  35  70  85  25  98
2  66  65  77  96  50  50  19  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 64 23  5 14 89 40 70]
 [94 20 51 35 70 85 25 98]
 [66 65 77 96 50 50 19 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This is a simplified version of the "maximum weighted matching" problem.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [3, 64, 23, 5, 14, 89, 40, 70]
Agent 1: [94, 20, 51, 35, 70, 85, 25, 98]
Agent 2: [66, 65, 77, 96, 50, 50, 19, 23]
```

Now, we'll allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 5 (value 89), followed by item 7 (value 70).
- **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 94), followed by item 7 (value 98).
- **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 96), followed by item 2 (value 77).

We'll ensure each agent receives at least one high-value item:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, let's assign the remaining items considering the highest valuations and ensuring no duplicate allocations:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 after item 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest available value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (second highest available value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest for Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0).

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 6],
    "1": [0, 7, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation preferences.
