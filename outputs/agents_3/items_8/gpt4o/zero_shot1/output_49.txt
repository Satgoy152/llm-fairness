Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  38  29  91  35  85  97  70
1  24  78  82  35  67   0   9  59
2   0   7  59  35  21  64   0  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider strategies that maximize the total valuation for each agent or try to balance the overall satisfaction by distributing the items based on their values. A common approach is to use a method like the "maximum sum valuation" or similar criteria.

Let's first consider the values each agent assigns to each item, then allocate the items to the agents in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 5, 6, and 7. 
   - Allocate items 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values items 1 and 2 highly. 
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 5 but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next best high-value items for Agent 2 are 4 and 7.
   - Allocate items 4 and 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 higher than other agents.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent, all items are allocated, and attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their individual preferences.
