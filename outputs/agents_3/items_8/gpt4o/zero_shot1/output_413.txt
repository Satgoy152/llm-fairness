Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  98  41  12  54  12  38  36
1  35   2  15  13  50   5   6  69
2  37  88  93  28  53   1  67  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 4. 
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 and 6 highly.

Here's a potential allocation that considers these valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3, 5, 6

Now each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4, which have high valuations for them.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 7, with item 7 being particularly valued.
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 3, 5, and 6, with items 2 and 6 being highly valued.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets items that they highly value.
