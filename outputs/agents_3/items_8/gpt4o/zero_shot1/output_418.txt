Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  88  77   4  29  65  80  56
1  83  44  13  77  25  10  86  94
2  80  76  15  43  77  93  87  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one way to allocate them fairly might be to give 3 items to one agent and 2 items each to the other two agents. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Prioritize High Valuations**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible, without overlapping.

   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 88).
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the most (value 94).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (value 93).

   Initial allocation:
   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [7]
   - Agent 2: [5]

2. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items while maximizing individual agent valuations and ensuring fairness.

   - Agent 0: Next highest values are item 6 (value 80) and item 0 (value 60).
   - Agent 1: Next highest values are item 0 (value 83) and item 6 (value 86).
   - Agent 2: Next highest values are item 6 (value 87) and item 4 (value 77).

   Continue the allocation based on the remaining items and the goal for fairness.

   Let's try:
   - Agent 0: Add items 6 (value 80) and 0 (value 60).
   - Agent 1: Add items 3 (value 77) and 2 (value 13).
   - Agent 2: Add items 4 (value 77) and 2 (value 15).

   Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: [1, 6, 0]
   - Agent 1: [7, 3, 2]
   - Agent 2: [5, 4]

3. **Verify Total Items**: Ensure all 8 items are allocated, and no item is allocated more than once.

   Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 0],
    "1": [7, 3, 2],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, with no items left unallocated or repeated.
