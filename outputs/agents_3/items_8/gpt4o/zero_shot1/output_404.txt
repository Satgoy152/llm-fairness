Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  45  14  73  87  27  16  29
1  61  77  55  57  33  58  97  44
2  79  82  58  35  81  41  37   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items based on a fair distribution of value:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent and allocate items based on maximizing their individual value.

2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values items 3 and 4 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 6, 1, and 2 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 0, 1, and 4 highly.

Let's assign items with the goal of maximizing fairness:

- Agent 0: Assign item 3 (73) and item 4 (87) for high valuation.
- Agent 1: Assign item 6 (97) and item 2 (55) for high valuation.
- Agent 2: Assign item 0 (79), item 1 (82), item 5 (41), and item 7 (1) to balance the load.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their high valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
