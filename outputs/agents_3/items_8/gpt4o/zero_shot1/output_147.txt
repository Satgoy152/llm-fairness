Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  20  69  26  15  67  64  96
1  12  75  48  87  35  38  32  74
2  99  43  85  89  72  69  21  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate each agent's total potential value for different combinations of items to find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [52, 20, 69, 26, 15, 67, 64, 96]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [12, 75, 48, 87, 35, 38, 32, 74]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [99, 43, 85, 89, 72, 69, 21, 32]

Given the values, we aim to balance the allocation so that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items with higher values from their perspective: [0, 5, 6]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 52 (item 0) + 67 (item 5) + 64 (item 6) = 183

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items with higher values from their perspective: [1, 3, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 75 (item 1) + 87 (item 3) + 74 (item 7) = 236

- **Agent 2**: Allocate items with higher values from their perspective: [2, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 2: 85 (item 2) + 72 (item 4) = 157

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations to the extent possible while still distributing all items.

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives a fair distribution of items, considering the agents' preferences as reflected in their valuations.
