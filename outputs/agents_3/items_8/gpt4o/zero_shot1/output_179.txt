Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  26  81  91  96  32  52  65
1  55  70  57  30  29  81  96  67
2  25   3  55  98  46  50  66  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents to get a sense of which items are generally more valued.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction (valuation) while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values Item 3 highly at 91, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values Item 6 highly at 96, so assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values Item 3 highly at 98, but since it's already taken, assign another high-value item, Item 7, to Agent 2.
4. Continue assigning remaining items based on highest remaining valuation for each agent, ensuring all get a fair distribution.

After analyzing the values and trying to distribute the items fairly, here's one way to allocate the items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that contribute to a high total valuation for them, and all items are distributed.
