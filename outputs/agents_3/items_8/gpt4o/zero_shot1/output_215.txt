Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  42  54  20  46   3  96  60
1  35  19  66  93  49  89  85  31
2  86  65  17  55  11  87  15  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent based on their given valuations. We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a reasonable share of high-value items according to their own valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 is assigned items: 0, 6
- Agent 1 is assigned items: 3, 5, 2
- Agent 2 is assigned items: 1, 4, 7

This distribution attempts to give each agent items that maximize their respective values, while ensuring a fair distribution among the three agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
