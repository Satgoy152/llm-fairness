Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  98  81  91  38  52  52  22
1  78   8  45   6  28  36  56  40
2   9  39  65  69   0  15   8  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one possible approach:

1. Start by identifying the item each agent values the most and try to allocate that item to them.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair share of the items, considering their highest valuations.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (98).
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (78).
- Agent 2 values Item 3 the highest (69).

Based on this, we'll make initial allocations:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 4, 5, 6, 7). Consider the next highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (91), Item 0 & 2 (81 each)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (56), Item 5 (36)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (65), Item 7 (65)

Continuing with fair allocation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (65 is higher than any remaining option for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (56 is higher than any remaining option for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (52 is high relative to what's left for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (65 is high relative to what's left for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (38 is a reasonable allocation given remaining items).

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share of items according to their preferences, ensuring all 8 items are allocated.
