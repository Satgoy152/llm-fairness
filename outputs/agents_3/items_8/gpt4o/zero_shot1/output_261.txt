Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  34  88  97  80  32  97  13
1  22  92  95  13  43  62  54   5
2  70  56  54  10  36  80  11  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider maximizing the total value each agent can derive from their assigned items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 8 items and 3 agents, so a balanced distribution would mean each agent ideally gets about 2-3 items. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0: 29
  - 1: 34
  - 2: 88
  - 3: 97
  - 4: 80
  - 5: 32
  - 6: 97
  - 7: 13

- Agent 1 values items: 
  - 0: 22
  - 1: 92
  - 2: 95
  - 3: 13
  - 4: 43
  - 5: 62
  - 6: 54
  - 7: 5

- Agent 2 values items: 
  - 0: 70
  - 1: 56
  - 2: 54
  - 3: 10
  - 4: 36
  - 5: 80
  - 6: 11
  - 7: 64

Allocation strategy:
- Focus on assigning items to the agent who values them the most.
- Ensure each agent gets approximately 2-3 items, maintaining balance.

Allocation:
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (highest value 97).
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest value 97).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (highest value 95).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest value 92).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (highest value 80).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (highest value 70).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (remaining allocation with second highest value 80).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (remaining allocation with highest value 64).

Now, let's structure the allocation in the requested json format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5, 0, 7]
}
```
