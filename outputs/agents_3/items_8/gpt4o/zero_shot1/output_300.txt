Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  18   6  13  22  73  52  42
1  83  18  81  14   9  81  87  34
2  83  58   4  56  53   5  34  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [83 58  4 56 53  5 34 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One approach is to go through the items and assign them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- For item 0: 
  - Agent 1 and Agent 2 have the highest valuation (83). We can assign it to Agent 1.
- For item 1:
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (58). Assign it to Agent 2.
- For item 2:
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (81). Assign it to Agent 1.
- For item 3:
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (56). Assign it to Agent 2.
- For item 4:
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (53). Assign it to Agent 2.
- For item 5:
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation (73). Assign it to Agent 0.
- For item 6:
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (87). Assign it to Agent 1.
- For item 7:
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (75). Assign it to Agent 2.

Agent 1 ends up with 3 items, Agent 2 with 4 items, and Agent 0 with 1 item. This allocation ensures that every item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4, 7]
}
```
