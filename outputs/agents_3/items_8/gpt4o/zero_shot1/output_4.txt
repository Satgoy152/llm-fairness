Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  45  21  55  13  59  93  32
1  16   7  49  61  20  54  83  72
2  31  61  61  23  38  10   9  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 45 21 55 13 59 93 32]
 [16  7 49 61 20 54 83 72]
 [31 61 61 23 38 10  9 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least some items. 

Let's break down the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [49, 45, 21, 55, 13, 59, 93, 32]
- Agent 1: [16, 7, 49, 61, 20, 54, 83, 72]
- Agent 2: [31, 61, 61, 23, 38, 10, 9, 32]

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that tries to maximize the fairness and total satisfaction for each agent. We can try to assign the highest-valued items to each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: 93 (item 6), 59 (item 5), 55 (item 3)
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: 83 (item 6), 72 (item 7), 61 (item 3)
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: 61 (item 1), 61 (item 2), 38 (item 4)

By observing these preferences and the goal of fairness, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0, 3, and 5.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 1, 6, and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 and 4.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences while also ensuring that all 8 items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
