Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  84  29  53   5  11  35  87
1   4  41  51   2  45  77  20  33
2  50  60  15  70  96   1  27  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation sums to all 8 items.

One approach to achieve this is to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring a fair distribution of items. Here is one possible allocation:

- Allocate items based on the highest value an agent places on them, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
- Aim to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 3.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4

This allocation ensures that all agents receive a fair share of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
