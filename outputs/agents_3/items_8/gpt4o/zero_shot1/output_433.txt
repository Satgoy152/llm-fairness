Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  52  61  96  40  33  15  58
1  91  94  48  38  53   1  76  85
2  71  90  72  73  74  39  39  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 52 61 96 40 33 15 58]
 [91 94 48 38 53  1 76 85]
 [71 90 72 73 74 39 39 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent and then adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 78, 52, 61, 96, 40, 33, 15, 58
- Agent 1: 91, 94, 48, 38, 53, 1, 76, 85
- Agent 2: 71, 90, 72, 73, 74, 39, 39, 66

First, we look at the highest valuations for each item across all agents to determine who values each item the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with 94.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with 72.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 74.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 33.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most with 76.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most with 85.

Now, we allocate items to agents based on these valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number allocated is 8:

1. Assign items 0, 1, 6, and 7 to Agent 1 (4 items).
2. Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 0 (2 items).
3. Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 2 (2 items).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least some items, and the total allocation is fair considering the valuation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
