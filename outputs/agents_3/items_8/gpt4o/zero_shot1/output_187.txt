Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  41  59  66  29  19  43   3
1  96  18  15  34  46  37   0  28
2  44  80  71  35  27  71  30  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 41 59 66 29 19 43  3]
 [96 18 15 34 46 37  0 28]
 [44 80 71 35 27 71 30 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign items with higher values for agent 0.
   - Items assigned: 0 (value 62), 3 (value 66)

2. Agent 1: Assign items where agent 1 has relatively high values.
   - Items assigned: 4 (value 46), 5 (value 37), 7 (value 28)

3. Agent 2: Assign remaining items considering agent 2's preferences.
   - Items assigned: 1 (value 80), 2 (value 71), 6 (value 30)

Let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3 with values 62 and 66 respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 4, 5, and 7 with values 46, 37, and 28 respectively.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 6 with values 80, 71, and 30 respectively.

Now let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
