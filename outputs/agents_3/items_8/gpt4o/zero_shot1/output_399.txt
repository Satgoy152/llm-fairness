Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  94  57   2  67  89  93  44
1  89  77   9  42  86  70  97  86
2   2  59  80  21  48  13  29  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 94 57  2 67 89 93 44]
 [89 77  9 42 86 70 97 86]
 [ 2 59 80 21 48 13 29 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One way to do this is to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has, while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should get approximately 2-3 items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 96
   - Item 1: 94
   - Item 5: 89

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 6: 97
   - Item 4: 86
   - Item 7: 86

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 2: 80
   - Item 3: 21

This allocation ensures that each agent gets approximately the same number of items, and the total valuation is maximized for each agent.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
