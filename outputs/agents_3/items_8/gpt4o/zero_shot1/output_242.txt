Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  33  77  82  60  64  74  63
1  41  98  39  20  21  88  48  92
2  34  65  98   9  31  40  90  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method like the "Round Robin" or "Greedy" allocation, where each agent takes turns selecting the item that provides them the highest value until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a simple greedy allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (Value = 82)
   - Next highest: Item 6 (Value = 74)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (Value = 77)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (Value = 98)
   - Next highest: Item 7 (Value = 92)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (Value = 98) [Already taken by Agent 0]
   - Next highest: Item 6 (Value = 90) [Already taken by Agent 0]
   - Next highest: Item 5 (Value = 40)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (Value = 34)

Now, let's ensure each agent has items and the allocation is complete:

- Agent 0: [3, 6, 2]
- Agent 1: [1, 7]
- Agent 2: [5, 0, 4]

Each agent has been allocated items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 0, 4]
}
```
