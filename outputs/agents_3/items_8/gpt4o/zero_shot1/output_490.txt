Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  85  20  21  95  71  55  86
1  13  50  50  21  15  91  39  66
2  33  57  85   4  64  66  80  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 85 20 21 95 71 55 86]
 [13 50 50 21 15 91 39 66]
 [33 57 85  4 64 66 80 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, we can aim to allocate 2 or 3 items per agent.

Let's attempt a fair allocation by considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (95) and 7 (86).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 (91) and 7 (66).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (85) and 6 (80).

To avoid conflicts and ensure fair distribution, let's distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 0 (total value: 95 + 28 = 123).
- Agent 1 gets items 5 and 1 (total value: 91 + 50 = 141).
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 6, 3, and 7 (total value: 85 + 80 + 4 + 71 = 240).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of high-value items while ensuring all items are allocated. 

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [2, 6, 3, 7]
}
```
