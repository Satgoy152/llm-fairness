Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  87  69  72  75  70  78  44
1  68  27  62  40  97  95  59  39
2  64  36  95  41  56  19  75  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here’s a possible approach:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items**:
   - Agent 0: 79 + 87 + 69 + 72 + 75 + 70 + 78 + 44 = 574
   - Agent 1: 68 + 27 + 62 + 40 + 97 + 95 + 59 + 39 = 487
   - Agent 2: 64 + 36 + 95 + 41 + 56 + 19 + 75 + 67 = 453

2. **Allocate items to the agent who values them most**. Go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest value for that item:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 67.

3. **Verify the allocations ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items**:

   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 3]
   - Agent 1: [4, 5]
   - Agent 2: [2, 6, 7]

4. **Present the allocation in the requested JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and attempts to satisfy each agent’s highest valuations per item.
