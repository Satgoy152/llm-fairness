Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  87  62  64  66  93  83  54
1  88  85   2   3  48  99  82  50
2  49  78  51  39  66  79  84  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 78 51 39 66 79 84 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to make sure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations are for items 1 (87), 5 (93), and 6 (83).
   - Let's allocate items 1, 5, and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations are for items 0 (88), 5 (99), and 6 (82).
   - Since item 5 and 6 are already allocated to Agent 0, let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - We can also allocate item 4 (48) to Agent 1, as Agent 0 has some high-valued items already.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations are for items 7 (99) and 6 (84).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 as it is the highest value for them.
   - Items 2 (51) and 3 (39) are left, and they are more valuable to Agent 2 than to others.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Items 1, 5, and 6 → Agent 0
- Item 0 and 4 → Agent 1
- Items 2, 3, and 7 → Agent 2

This allocation assigns all items and attempts to consider each agent's preferences. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
