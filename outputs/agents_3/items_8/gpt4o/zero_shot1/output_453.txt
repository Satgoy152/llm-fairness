Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  40  97  99  97  15  36  93
1   2  83  23   3  63  20  36  80
2  30  13   7  11  78  96  27  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 13  7 11 78 96 27 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to distribute all 8 items in total among the agents.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0: 47 + 40 + 97 + 99 + 97 + 15 + 36 + 93 = 524
- Agent 1: 2 + 83 + 23 + 3 + 63 + 20 + 36 + 80 = 310
- Agent 2: 30 + 13 + 7 + 11 + 78 + 96 + 27 + 53 = 315

Next, we can allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction, considering their valuations.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (99). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (83). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (96). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (97). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (97). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1 values item 7 highly (80). Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 2 values item 4 next (78), but it's already allocated. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (next choice: item 6).
8. Finally, distribute remaining items fairly based on remaining high values for other agents.

Let's ensure all items are allocated and adjust if needed:

- Agent 0: [3, 2, 4] (allocated 3 items)
- Agent 1: [1, 7] (allocated 2 items)
- Agent 2: [5, 0, 6] (allocated 3 items)

These allocations fairly distribute the items based on the agents' preferences and ensure all 8 items are allocated. 

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 0, 6]
}
```
