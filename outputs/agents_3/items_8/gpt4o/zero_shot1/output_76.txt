Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  76  89  34  98  87  48  55
1   2  70  92  13   4  11  80   6
2  19  76  37  22  50  44  38  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Highest: Item 4 (98)
  - Second highest: Item 2 (89)
  - Third highest: Item 5 (87)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Highest: Item 2 (92)
  - Second highest: Item 0 (70)
  - Third highest: Item 6 (80)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Highest: Item 1 (76)
  - Second highest: Item 7 (68)
  - Third highest: Item 4 (50)

Considering these preferences, we can try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign Agent 0 their highest valued item: Item 4.
2. Assign Agent 1 their highest valued item: Item 2.
3. Assign Agent 2 their highest valued item: Item 1.

Now, we continue assigning the remaining items:

- Agent 0:
  - Already has Item 4, next highest available is Item 5 (87).
  
- Agent 1:
  - Already has Item 2, next highest available is Item 6 (80).
  
- Agent 2:
  - Already has Item 1, next highest available is Item 7 (68).

With these allocations, each agent has 2 items:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 7

Now we have to allocate the remaining items (0, 3):

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since they value it at 70.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 since they value it at 34.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 3],
    "1": [2, 6, 0],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```
