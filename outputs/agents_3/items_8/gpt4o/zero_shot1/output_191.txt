Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7   8  59  51  98   7  99  36
1  71  88  83  61  56   4  71  28
2  99  32  73  45  15  37  22  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 88 83 61 56  4 71 28]
 [99 32 73 45 15 37 22 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while considering the constraints. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 4 (98), 6 (99)
   - Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 0, as these two have the highest value for them.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (88), 2 (83), 0 (71)
   - Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1, as these have the highest value for them.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (99), 3 (45)
   - Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 2, as these have the highest value for them.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 5 and 7 are left.
   - Agent 1 has a slight preference for item 7 over Agent 2 (28 vs. 11).
   - Agent 2 has a preference for item 5 (37 vs. 4 of Agent 1).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 and item 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on valuations and that each agent gets some items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
