Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2   0  87  28  62  31  40  61
1  79  32  78  33   8  30   7  19
2  24  69  43   9  51  34  47  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one method to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 4, so we can prioritize giving these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 and 2, but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can give Agent 1 item 0.
3. **Agent 2** has a decent valuation for item 1, so we can give this item to Agent 2.

Continuing this process to ensure that every agent gets a reasonable value allocation, we can come up with the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 3, 7
- Agent 2 gets items: 1, 5, 6

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated fairly based on the valuations provided in the table.
