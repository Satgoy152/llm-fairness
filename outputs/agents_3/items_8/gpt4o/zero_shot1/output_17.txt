Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   1  93   9  35  58  29  18
1  99  69  99  43  90  50  95  86
2  12  13  13  98  39  35  24  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations of the items. This involves assigning items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:  
- Items valued highest by Agent 0: 2 (93), 5 (58), 0 (44)

Agent 1:
- Items valued highest by Agent 1: 0 (99), 2 (99), 4 (90), 6 (95)

Agent 2:
- Items valued highest by Agent 2: 3 (98), 7 (96)

Now, let's try to allocate items:

1. Assign Agent 1 items where they have the highest values:
   - Items 0 (99), 2 (99), and 6 (95)

2. Assign Agent 2 the items where they have the highest values:
   - Items 3 (98) and 7 (96)

3. Assign Agent 0 the remaining items:
   - Items 1 (1), 4 (35), and 5 (58)

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable distribution based on their preferences and ensures that all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 7]
}
```
