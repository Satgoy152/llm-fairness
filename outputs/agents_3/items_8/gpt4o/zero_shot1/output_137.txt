Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31   4  46  80  57  99  11  49
1  19  36  52  10  47  43  94  24
2  17  53  45  56  24   6  17  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31  4 46 80 57 99 11 49]
 [19 36 52 10 47 43 94 24]
 [17 53 45 56 24  6 17 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we will attempt to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the valuation matrix given:

```
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31   4  46  80  57  99  11  49
1  19  36  52  10  47  43  94  24
2  17  53  45  56  24   6  17  57
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we will:

1. Identify the item that provides the highest value to each agent and allocate it to them if possible without violating the total number of items constraint.
2. Repeat the process while ensuring that the total allocations do not exceed 8 items.
3. Aim to maximize the total utility across all agents.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 99), item 3 (value 80).
2. Agent 1 gets item 6 (value 94), item 2 (value 52).
3. Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 57), item 1 (value 53), item 4 (value 24), and item 0 (value 17).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [7, 1, 4, 0]
}
```
