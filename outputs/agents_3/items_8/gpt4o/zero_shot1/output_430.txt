Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  21  81  12   2  53  66  62
1  22  29   4  55  51  66  52  26
2   9  62  24  25   3  68  82  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 2. Allocating these items to Agent 0 ensures high total value for them.
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 and item 5 quite highly. Allocating these items to Agent 1 is beneficial in maximizing their total valuation.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 6 and 1. Allocating these items to Agent 2 maximizes their total valuation.

4. **Remaining Items**: Item 4 and item 7 have lower valuations across all agents, so we can allocate them to balance out the number of items each agent receives. For this allocation, we'll assign item 4 to Agent 1 and item 7 to Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 4],
    "2": [6, 1, 7]
}
```
