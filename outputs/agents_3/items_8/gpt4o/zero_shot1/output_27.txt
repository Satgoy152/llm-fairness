Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  82  64  30  89  29  63  64
1  91   4   2  92  45  20  41  14
2  79  52  94  49  63  42  99  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent and try to allocate those first.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to maintain fairness.
3. Continue assigning remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Their highest value is for item 4 (89), then item 0 (87), then items 2 and 7 (64 each).
- Agent 1: Their highest value is for item 3 (92), then item 0 (91).
- Agent 2: Their highest value is for item 6 (99), then item 2 (94).

Here's one potential allocation:

- Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2.

After these highest values are assigned, we need to allocate the remaining items fairly. Considering the next highest values and ensuring each agent has a nearly equal number of items, we can proceed:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (91).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (94).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (64).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (42).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (82).

Let's finalize the allocations ensuring all items have been allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [6, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all 8 items are distributed.
