Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  83  67   7  74  17  23  17
1  99   4  67   9  25  89  38  97
2  80  29  32  74  13  63  79  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, assigning each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's assign the items:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item first to ensure everyone receives at least one item.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on the highest valuation from the remaining agents.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 99.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 83.
- **Item 2**: Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value item 2 equally at 67, but to balance initial distribution, assign to Agent 2, who hasn't received an item yet.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 74.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 74.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 89.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most with a valuation of 79.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values item 7 the most with a valuation of 97.

Now, let's ensure the distribution is fair:

- Agent 0 has items [1,4].
- Agent 1 has items [0,5,7].
- Agent 2 has items [2,3,6].

Each agent has received a fair share based on their highest valuation and the equal distribution of items.

Here's the final allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
