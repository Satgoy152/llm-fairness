Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  62   1  71  40   3   3  44
1  18  35  15  27  66  22  38   3
2  62  23  28  70   0  31   2  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 23 28 70  0 31  2 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the given valuation table and make allocations:

```
Agent 0 Valuations: [42, 62, 1, 71, 40, 3, 3, 44]
Agent 1 Valuations: [18, 35, 15, 27, 66, 22, 38, 3]
Agent 2 Valuations: [62, 23, 28, 70, 0, 31, 2, 96]
```

We will assign items based on maximizing each agent's values while ensuring fairness in distribution:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (62) and 3 (71).
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4 (66).
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 (62), 3 (70), and 7 (96).

Item allocation strategy:
- Agent 0: Assign item 3 (71) and item 1 (62).
- Agent 1: Assign item 4 (66).
- Agent 2: Assign item 0 (62) and item 7 (96).

Remaining items are 2, 5, and 6. We will distribute these considering the next best available valuations:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (31).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (38).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (15).

Final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items that maximize their valuations where possible.
