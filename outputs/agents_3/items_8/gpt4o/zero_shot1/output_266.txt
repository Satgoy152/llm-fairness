Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  74  64  19   3  78  43  74
1  81  73  16   2  60  68  63  93
2  26  56  50   8  40  99  14  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. This involves considering the value each agent places on each item and trying to distribute the items so that the total value for each agent is balanced.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [39, 74, 64, 19, 3, 78, 43, 74]
- Agent 1 values: [81, 73, 16, 2, 60, 68, 63, 93]
- Agent 2 values: [26, 56, 50, 8, 40, 99, 14, 79]

Given these values, a possible allocation could be:

1. Assign items based on the highest value for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 81)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 74)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (value 64)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value 19)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 60)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 99)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (value 63)
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (value 93)

2. Ensure each agent has an integer number of items:
   - Agent 0: 3 items (0, 1, 2)
   - Agent 1: 4 items (3, 4, 6, 7)
   - Agent 2: 1 item (5)

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valued items for each agent while distributing all 8 items among the agents.
