Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  26  66  52  97  23  52  80
1   2  80  72  52  46  20  13  73
2  20  86  15  50  93  14  30  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, provided this doesn't violate the fairness of distribution.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them to the agents:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 72
   - Agent 2 values it at 15
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 values it at 50
   - Both Agents 0 and 1 value it equally. To balance allocation, let's **assign to Agent 0**.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 93
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 30
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 80
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

After this allocation, Agent 0 has been assigned several items. To ensure fairness, let's redistribute some items so that each agent receives a more even distribution:

- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 1 (as it was tied between Agents 0 and 1).
- Reassign Item 5 to Agent 2 to balance the number of items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items, and all items are allocated.
