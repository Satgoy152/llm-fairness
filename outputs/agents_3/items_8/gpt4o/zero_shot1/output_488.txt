Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  90  79  34  88  88  52  92
1  79  64  52  95  31  87  25  24
2  89  17  37  60  93  64  23  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. We can achieve this by iterating through each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 79.
   - Agent 2 values it at 89.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Agent 2 values it at 17.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - Agent 2 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Agent 2 values it at 60.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Agent 2 values it at 93.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 87.
   - Agent 2 values it at 64.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 52.
   - Agent 1 values it at 25.
   - Agent 2 values it at 23.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Agent 2 values it at 29.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

After these allocations, let's ensure fairness by adjusting allocations so that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated equals 8. We'll give Agent 2 item 5 and 6 from Agent 0, and Agent 1 item 7 from Agent 0 to balance.

The final allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations and ensures each agent has at least some items.
