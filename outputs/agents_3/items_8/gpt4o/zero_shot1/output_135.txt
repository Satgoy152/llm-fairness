Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  45  49  74  58  75  96  32
1  83  64  91  52  53  25  56   1
2  39  94  33   8  33  38  93  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We'll use a simple greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item due to the constraint of integer allocations and fairness.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

8. **Item 7:** 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 52.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Items 1, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent gets at least one item. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```
