Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  82  32  19  26  74  90  75
1  23  29  49  13  17  79  37  22
2  83  40  26  81  30  95  50  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes satisfaction. One approach could be to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's break down the assignment:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation step by step:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 83.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 82.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 49.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 81.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest at 30.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest at 75.

Now, let's verify the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4, 5

This allocation results in Agent 0 receiving 3 items, Agent 1 receiving 1 item, and Agent 2 receiving 4 items, which sums up to all 8 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
