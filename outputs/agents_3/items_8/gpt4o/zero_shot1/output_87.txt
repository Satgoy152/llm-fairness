Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98   5   1   0  87   8  77  44
1  83  82  65  56  24  32  13  74
2  89  49  62  14  61  99  41  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the valuations to guide us, aiming to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 98.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 83.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 99.

2. **Allocate items based on highest individual preference while ensuring fairness**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because they value it the most.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 because they value it the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Continue allocating remaining items by considering remaining values.

3. **Allocate remaining items while considering second preferences and balance**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (87), as it is the next highest valued item not yet allocated.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (96), as it is the next highest value after item 5.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (65), as it is the next highest value available.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (77), as it is the next highest value available.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (56), as it is the next highest value available.

The allocations based on this approach are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated, while also trying to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible.
