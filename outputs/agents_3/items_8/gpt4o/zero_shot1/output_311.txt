Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  13  45  14   7  32  26  39
1  95   3  74  74  26  84  27  83
2  49  39  85  66  85  68  63  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total value based on their preferences. We'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations for each agent and item:

Agent 0:
- Items valued: [10, 13, 45, 14, 7, 32, 26, 39]

Agent 1:
- Items valued: [95, 3, 74, 74, 26, 84, 27, 83]

Agent 2:
- Items valued: [49, 39, 85, 66, 85, 68, 63, 81]

A potential strategy is to assign items based on the highest value each agent has for an item and ensure that every agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest valuation of 95).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (highest valuation of 85).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (highest valuation of 84).
4. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (highest valuation of 83).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (highest valuation of 85).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (highest valuation of 63).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valuation of 13).
8. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (valuation of 14).

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
