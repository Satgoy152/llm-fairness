Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  40  86  69  66  87  18   8
1  92  70  78  99  64  55  93  72
2  60  64  77  13  30  48  46  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 64 77 13 30 48 46 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's one possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with highest valuations: Item 5 (87), Item 2 (86), Item 3 (69)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 0 (92), Item 6 (93)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with highest valuations: Item 2 (77), Item 5 (48), Item 1 (64)

Now let's assign items to agents, considering the highest valuations and ensuring all items are allocated exactly once:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (87) - since it's the highest valuation for Agent 0 among remaining unassigned items.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (86).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (99) - since it's the highest valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (92).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (93).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (64) - since it's the highest valuation for Agent 2 among remaining unassigned items.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (66) - as Agent 0's next highest available option.
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (43).

This way, each agent gets a number of items, and all items are assigned. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items maximizing their total valuations.
