Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  64  75  63  30  30  89   1
1  53  70   9  12  19  90  62  79
2   2  84  81  41  46  17  25  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive 3 items, and the other two will receive 2 items each.

Let's start by examining the valuation table and allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  64  75  63  30  30  89   1
1  53  70   9  12  19  90  62  79
2   2  84  81  41  46  17  25  47
```

1. **Agent 0** has high values on items 2 and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high values on items 5 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has high values on items 1 and 2.

To achieve a fair allocation, we look for a distribution that allows each agent to have a high value:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 75).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 89).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 63).

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 90).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value 79).

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 84).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 46).

This leaves item 0, which can be allocated to Agent 1 (value 53).

Each agent gets a reasonable value, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 3],
    "1": [5, 7, 0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair portion of the total value based on their preferences.
