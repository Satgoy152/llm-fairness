Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  70  98  44  28  69  47  89
1  53   9  92  89  89  16   7  94
2  87  33  24  93  10  41  51  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations. A possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: 2 (98)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: 7 (94)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: 3 (93)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2

After each agent has received one of their highest-valued items, we continue allocating based on remaining values while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

4. **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest value item: 1 (70)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest value item: 4 (89)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1

7. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest value item: 0 (87)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2

8. **Remaining Items**: 5, 6

9. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest remaining value item: 5 (69)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0

10. **Agent 2**: 
    - Highest remaining value item: 6 (51)
    - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2

Each agent has now received a fair allocation of items based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 5],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [3, 0, 6]
}
```
