Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  23  67  94  51   3  93  79
1   7  99  45  92  25   8  61  45
2  44  18  63  94  85  34  40  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 23 67 94 51  3 93 79]
 [ 7 99 45 92 25  8 61 45]
 [44 18 63 94 85 34 40 41]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 2-3 items.

Let's analyze the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Has high valuations for items 3 (94), 6 (93), and 2 (67).
   - Let's assign item 3 (94) and item 6 (93) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has high valuations for items 1 (99) and 3 (92).
   - Item 3 is already assigned to Agent 0, so we assign item 1 (99) to Agent 1.
   - Also, assign item 2 (45) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has high valuations for items 3 (94), 4 (85), and 2 (63).
   - Item 3 is already assigned, so we assign item 4 (85) and item 5 (34) to Agent 2.

Now we check if all items are allocated:
- Agent 0: 3, 6
- Agent 1: 1, 2
- Agent 2: 4, 5

Items remaining: 0, 7

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Assign item 0 (60) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 7 (41) to Agent 2.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: 1, 2
- Agent 2: 4, 5, 7

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
