Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  37  93  48  31  51  57   3
1  56  71   5  68  31  37  21  66
2  31  67  20  14  64  34  37  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the satisfaction or value each agent gets from the items they receive. One approach is to allocate the items to the agents who value them the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives roughly the same number of items if possible.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 71
   - Agent 2 values it at 67
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 93
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 48
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 31
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 2 values it at 64
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Agent 2 values it at 34
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 21
   - Agent 2 values it at 37
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Agent 2 gets item: 4

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also considering a roughly equal distribution where feasible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "2": [4]
}
```
