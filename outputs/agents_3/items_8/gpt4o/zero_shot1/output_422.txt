Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  16  84   5  10  26  10  15
1  27   7  89  70  44  77  23  64
2  79  64  81  70  57  75  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 16 84  5 10 26 10 15]
 [27  7 89 70 44 77 23 64]
 [79 64 81 70 57 75 59 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach where we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [19, 16, 84, 5, 10, 26, 10, 15]
- Agent 1: [27, 7, 89, 70, 44, 77, 23, 64]
- Agent 2: [79, 64, 81, 70, 57, 75, 59, 55]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 1 (89) and Agent 0 (84), but Agent 1 values it the most. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 5** is highly valued by Agent 1 (77) and Agent 2 (75). Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 since they value it slightly more.
3. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 2 (79). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3** is valued equally by Agents 1 and 2 (70 each), but Agent 1 already has two valuable items. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 6** is valued relatively equally by Agents 1 (23) and 2 (59). Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 to balance the total allocations.
6. **Item 7** is valued more by Agent 1 (64). Assign Item 7 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 1** is valued most by Agent 2 (64). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
8. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 1 (44). Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 5, 7, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 6, 1]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives no items, Agent 1 receives Items 2, 5, 7, and 4, and Agent 2 receives Items 0, 3, 6, and 1. This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.
