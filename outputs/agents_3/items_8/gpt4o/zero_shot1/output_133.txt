Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  94  21  15  92  73  54  19
1   3  78  85  69  32   9  37  62
2  94  86  95  17  58  12  33   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we want to distribute the items among the agents such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. We can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives a roughly equal number of items or as close as possible.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 73.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 54.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 62.

Now, let's balance the distribution:

- Agent 0 initially has five items (1, 4, 5, 6) which is too many.
- Agent 1 has two items (3, 7).
- Agent 2 has two items (0, 2).

Rebalance by giving item 6 to Agent 2 to make the distribution fairer:

- Agent 0: [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 6]

This allocation gives each agent roughly equal representation in terms of item count.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
