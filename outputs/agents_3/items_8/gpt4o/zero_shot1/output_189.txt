Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  58  31  21  72  33  33  70
1  20  14   1   1  69  83   4  37
2  38  16  65  90  77   8  57  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent gets from the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (58) and 4 (72). Giving them these items maximizes their total value.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (83) highly. Assigning this item to them gives them a high total value.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has very high valuations for items 3 (90) and 2 (65). Assigning these items to them ensures they get a high total value.

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than their fair share, we can further distribute the remaining items considering their valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a relatively higher value for them compared to others.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2, as it has a higher value for them compared to others.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it balances the allocation and Agent 1 has a reasonable value for it.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
