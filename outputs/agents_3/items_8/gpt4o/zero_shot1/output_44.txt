Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   6  34  66  23  87  47  81
1  19  19  69  64  98  65  69  16
2  54  96  50  29  42  25  27  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44  6 34 66 23 87 47 81]
 [19 19 69 64 98 65 69 16]
 [54 96 50 29 42 25 27 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. We start by identifying the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair number of items, ideally close to the total number of items divided by the number of agents (8 items / 3 agents â‰ˆ 2.67 items per agent).

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 54.
- **Item 1:** 
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 96.
- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 69.
- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 66.
- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 98.
- **Item 5:**
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 87.
- **Item 6:**
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 69.
- **Item 7:**
  - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 81.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
