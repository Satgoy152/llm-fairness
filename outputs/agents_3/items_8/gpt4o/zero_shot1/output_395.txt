Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  76  57   8  61  30  34  92
1  96  22  53  89   2  57  69  65
2  62  83  18  46  77  91  76  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. One way to approach this is by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least some items if possible. Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, one potential allocation approach is to give each agent at least 2 items, and then distribute the remaining items based on highest valuations.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least 2 items.

Using this method, we arrive at the following allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (83).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (57).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (77).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (69).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (92).

Now, let's ensure fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least 2 items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
