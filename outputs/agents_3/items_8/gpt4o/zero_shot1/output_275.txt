Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  70   7  51   6  47  91  43
1  87   6  79  66  81  30  25  80
2  91  97  20  17  25  57  86  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87  6 79 66 81 30 25 80]
 [91 97 20 17 25 57 86 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most without exceeding the total available items and ensuring every agent gets a roughly fair share. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 79.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 66.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 57.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 80.

2. Check the allocation balance:
   - Agent 0 gets: [6]
   - Agent 1 gets: [2, 3, 4, 7]
   - Agent 2 gets: [0, 1, 5]

3. Adjust if necessary for fairness:
   - Agent 0 currently gets one item, which is reasonable given the constraints.
   - Agents 1 and 2 have a balanced load of 3 and 4 items, respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their maximum valuations while ensuring all 8 items are distributed.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
