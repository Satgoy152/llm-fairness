Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  27  66  26  99  64  10  11
1  49  32   3  65  39  20   0  27
2  68  98   2  66  18   9  11  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items**: Start by identifying which items are most valuable to each agent. This will help in assigning items in a way that maximizes satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items based on agent preferences**: Try to allocate items so that each agent gets their most valued items, considering the other agents' preferences as well.

3. **Ensure all items are distributed**: Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share.

Using the table, let's proceed:

- **Agent 0's top preferences**:
  - Item 4 (value 99)
  - Item 2 (value 66)
  - Item 5 (value 64)

- **Agent 1's top preferences**:
  - Item 3 (value 65)
  - Item 0 (value 49)
  - Item 1 (value 32)

- **Agent 2's top preferences**:
  - Item 1 (value 98)
  - Item 0 (value 68)
  - Item 7 (value 75)

A possible allocation strategy:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value of 99)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (second-highest value of 68)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value of 98)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value of 65)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (high value of 66)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (high value of 64)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (high value of 75)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (as it has value 0 for Agent 1 and 11 for Agent 2, but Agent 2 already has high-value items)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
