Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  58  42   1  77  89  41  31
1  21  63  64  65  88  99   0  49
2  80  13  73  39   5  91  27  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll go through the table and assign items to agents based on the highest value they have for those items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (89), Item 4 (77), Item 1 (58)
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 4 (88), Item 3 (65)
3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (80), Item 5 (91), Item 2 (73)

Assign items based on the highest value without assigning an item more than once:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 99)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 88)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 65)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 80)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (value 73)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 58)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (value 31)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 41)

Now, ensure all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
