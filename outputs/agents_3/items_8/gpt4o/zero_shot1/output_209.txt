Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  93   9  55  73  51  16  45
1  65  33  59   9  91  97   7  28
2  64  23  65  56   0  95  38  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 93  9 55 73 51 16 45]
 [65 33 59  9 91 97  7 28]
 [64 23 65 56  0 95 38 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items based on maximizing the valuation for each agent:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the respective agent:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 65)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 93)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (value 65)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 56)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 91)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (value 97)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (value 38)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 (value 93)

2. Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuations:

   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [0, 4, 5]
   - Agent 2: [2, 3, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```
