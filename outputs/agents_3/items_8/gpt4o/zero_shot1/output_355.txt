Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96   6  33   7  43  23   2  90
1  90  96  12   1  89  94  87   5
2  90  67   2  58  51   6  72  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 96 12  1 89 94 87  5]
 [90 67  2 58 51  6 72 54]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do this:

1. First, identify which items each agent values the most, and try to assign those items first.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with a similar total value if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to balance the total value across agents if necessary.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (96), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96), so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (72), so we assign item 6 to agent 2.

Now, let's assign the remaining items while trying to balance the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 is assigned item 7 (90), which is highly valued by agent 0.
- Agent 1 is assigned item 4 (89), which is highly valued by agent 1.
- Agent 2 is assigned item 3 (58), which is relatively highly valued by agent 2.

Now we have assigned 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining two items:

- Agent 0 could benefit from item 5 (23) since it adds to their total value without exceeding the others by much.
- Agent 1 could take item 2 (12) to slightly increase their total value.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 2],
    "2": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
