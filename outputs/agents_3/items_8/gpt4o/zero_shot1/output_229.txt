Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  17  73  82  30  70  39  52
1  33  74  51  66  25  58  80  89
2  33  33  71  29  98  22  37  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 17 73 82 30 70 39 52]
 [33 74 51 66 25 58 80 89]
 [33 33 71 29 98 22 37 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 2 (73), Item 5 (70), Item 0 (68)
  
2. **Agent 1**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 7 (89), Item 6 (80), Item 1 (74), Item 3 (66)
  
3. **Agent 2**: 
    - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 2 (71), Item 7 (66)

To ensure fairness, we will try to allocate items based on the highest valuations and attempt to give each agent items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 3 (82)
  - Item 5 (70)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 7 (89)
  - Item 6 (80)
  - Item 1 (74)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 4 (98)
  - Item 2 (71)
  - Item 0 (33)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are distributed among the agents.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [7, 6, 1],
    "2": [4, 2, 0]
}
```
