Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  26  37  98  93  30   5  84
1  84  48  84  74  34  12  73  97
2  75  47  73  45   0  75  39  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a simple approach by examining the valuations and making a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  26  37  98  93  30   5  84
1  84  48  84  74  34  12  73  97
2  75  47  73  45   0  75  39  56
```

A good strategy could be to allocate items to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High values on items: 3 (98), 4 (93), 7 (84)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High values on items: 0 (84), 2 (84), 7 (97) 

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High values on items: 5 (75), 0 (75)

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuation while ensuring fairness:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value 98)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value 93)
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (highest value 97)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value 84)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value 75)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value 84)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value 73)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value 47)

Now, each agent has:

- Agent 0: 2 items (3, 4)
- Agent 1: 4 items (0, 2, 6, 7)
- Agent 2: 2 items (1, 5)

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
