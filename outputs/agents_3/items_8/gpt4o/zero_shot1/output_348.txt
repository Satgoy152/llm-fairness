Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  54  61  65  90  85  63  57
1  37  93  44  96   6   7  72  91
2  87  41  91  90  97  26   1  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 41 91 90 97 26  1 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can use a simple approach to maximize each agent's satisfaction, considering their valuations for each item. One reasonable way is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Analyze each item's valuations across all agents to determine which agent values it the highest.
2. Assign that item to the agent with the highest valuation.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent is included in the final allocation.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (87).
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (93).
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (91).
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (96).
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation (97).
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 has the highest valuation (85).
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (72).
- **Item 7:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation (91).

The allocation based on the highest valuations would be:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent, and all agents are represented in the allocation.
