Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  85  71  28   8  93   2  52
1  57  18  57  69  99  30  56  53
2  74   6  55  19  70   0  61  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We will attempt to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as high as possible, without any agent feeling significantly disadvantaged. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (85), Item 5 (93)
   - Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (99), Item 3 (69)
   - Assign items 4 and 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (74), Item 6 (61), Item 2 (55)
   - Assign items 0, 6, and 2 to Agent 2

This allocation leaves us with one item left, which is item 7. Let's allocate it to the agent with the least total valuation so far:

- Agent 0: Valuations for items 1 and 5 = 85 + 93 = 178
- Agent 1: Valuations for items 4 and 3 = 99 + 69 = 168
- Agent 2: Valuations for items 0, 6, and 2 = 74 + 61 + 55 = 190

Agent 1 has the least total valuation, so let's assign item 7 to Agent 1. This results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 6

The allocation is now complete with all items distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
