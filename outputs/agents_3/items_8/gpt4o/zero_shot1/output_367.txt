Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  45  87  39  66  67  62  69
1  67  13   4   7  51  70  67  70
2  66  50  70  36  80  71   5  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Since there are three agents and eight items, a balanced allocation might involve giving three items to two agents and two items to one agent.

Here is a potential allocation using a method to maximize each agent's happiness based on the values they assign to the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (87), Item 1 (45), Item 7 (69)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (70), Item 6 (67), Item 7 (70)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (80), Item 5 (71), Item 7 (80)

Let's allocate based on the above preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (31), Item 1 (45), Item 2 (87)
- **Agent 1:** Item 3 (7), Item 6 (67)
- **Agent 2:** Item 4 (80), Item 5 (71), Item 7 (80)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their highest values, while all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
