Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   4   7  48  11  16  68  70
1  22  13  41  87  13  11  36  68
2  26  27  34  92   3  50   4  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. We will attempt to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [11, 4, 7, 48, 11, 16, 68, 70]
   - Agent 1: [22, 13, 41, 87, 13, 11, 36, 68]
   - Agent 2: [26, 27, 34, 92, 3, 50, 4, 62]

2. **Assign the Highest Valued Items:**

   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest among all agents. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 70, which is the highest. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

3. **Continue with Next Highest Valuations:**

   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 68, which is the highest. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 27, which is the highest. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Assign Remaining Items Considering Fairness:**

   - Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 1 have the same value (11), but Agent 1 has fewer items. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 22, which is the highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 50, which is the highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 41, which is the highest. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Check Distribution:**

   - All 8 items are allocated.
   - Each agent has at least one item.

6. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets some of their higher-valued items, and all items are distributed among the agents.
