Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   4  97  45  82  12  55  73
1  76  88  72  78  72  56  53  76
2  78  68  50  22  71  41   2  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86  4 97 45 82 12 55 73]
 [76 88 72 78 72 56 53 76]
 [78 68 50 22 71 41  2 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is equal to 8. We should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items to maximize the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (Value 97)
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (Value 86)
   - Next highest value: Item 4 (Value 82)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (Value 88)
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (Value 78)
   - Next highest value: Item 7 (Value 76)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (Value 78), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next highest value: Item 4 (Value 71), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next highest value: Item 1 (Value 68), but already allocated to Agent 1
   - Next highest value: Item 5 (Value 41)
   - Next highest value: Item 7 (Value 51), but already allocated to Agent 1
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (Value 22)
   - Next highest value: Item 6 (Value 2)

Based on the above, here's a fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 0, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3, 7]
- Agent 2 gets items [5, 6]

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
