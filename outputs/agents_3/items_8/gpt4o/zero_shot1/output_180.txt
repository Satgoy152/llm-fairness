Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  13  75  51  71   4  94  14
1  90  53  30  64  34  13  28  51
2  77  34  70  86  84  91   5  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives approximately the same total value. Here’s a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value and Average Per Agent:**
   - Total value of all items for each agent:
     - Agent 0: 333
     - Agent 1: 363
     - Agent 2: 493
   - Average total value per agent = (333 + 363 + 493) / 3 = 396.33

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Value:**
   - Assign the top-valued items to each agent, ensuring each agent gets a fair share close to the average total value.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Agent 0:
     - Allocate items with the highest values first: Item 6 (94) and Item 2 (75) – Total = 169
   - Agent 1:
     - Allocate items with the highest values first: Item 0 (90) and Item 3 (64) – Total = 154
   - Agent 2:
     - Allocate items with the highest values first: Item 5 (91) and Item 4 (84) – Total = 175

4. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: Items 1, 7
   - Assign remaining items to balance out the total value among agents:
     - Agent 0: Item 7 (14) – Total = 183
     - Agent 1: Item 1 (53) – Total = 207

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent has a fair share considering the total value.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation strives to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
