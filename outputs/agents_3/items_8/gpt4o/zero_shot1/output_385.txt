Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  74  84  74  73  45  56  53
1  38  46  77  92  26   0  58  48
2  50   1  43  51  42  95   9  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50  1 43 51 42 95  9 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable allocation of the items based on their preferences. We'll attempt to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 
   - Item 2 (84)
   - Item 1 (74)
   - Item 3 (74)

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 3 (92)
   - Item 2 (77)
   - Item 6 (58)

3. **Agent 2's highest valued items**:
   - Item 5 (95)
   - Item 7 (58)
   - Item 3 (51)

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value while ensuring fairness:

- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (highest valuation of 92).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (highest valuation of 95).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (next highest valuation of 84 after items 3 and 5 are taken).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value of 74).
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value of 58).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value of 58).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value of 73).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value of 50).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent benefits from the allocation based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 7, 0]
}
```
