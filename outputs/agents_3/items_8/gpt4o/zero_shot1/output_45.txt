Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  58   7  61   3  70  13  89
1  86  16  24  99  56  20  85  45
2   6  16  74  12  29  90  75  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 16 24 99 56 20 85 45]
 [ 6 16 74 12 29 90 75 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items, ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent ends up with a balanced distribution of items. Let's try to find a balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 64
   - Item 3: Value 61
   - Total value = 64 + 61 = 125

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 5: Value 20
   - Item 7: Value 45
   - Total value = 20 + 45 = 65

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2: Value 74
   - Item 4: Value 29
   - Item 6: Value 75
   - Item 1: Value 16
   - Total value = 74 + 29 + 75 + 16 = 194

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation assigns each of the 8 items to one of the agents while attempting to balance the total value received by each agent.
