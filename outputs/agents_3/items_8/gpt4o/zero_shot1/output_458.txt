Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  92  53  25  41  61  47   0
1  92  92  55  71  39  50  58  16
2  28  10  14  68  48  84  26  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy approach to achieve this by considering the highest valuations first and then assigning the items accordingly.

First, let's analyze the valuations for each item and who values each item the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
- Item 1: Agent 0 and agent 1 value it equally at 92.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 55.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 71.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 48.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 58.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 0, agent 1 values it at 16, and agent 2 values it at 10.

Given this analysis, let's assign items to agents by highest value while ensuring fairness:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 92).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 92).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 55).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 71).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 48).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (value 84).
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (value 58).
8. Assign Item 7 to Agent 1 (value 16). 

Now, let's check for a fairer distribution by trying to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Give Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Give Items 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.
- Give Items 4 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- Agent 2 receives Items 4 and 5.

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the individual agents' valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
