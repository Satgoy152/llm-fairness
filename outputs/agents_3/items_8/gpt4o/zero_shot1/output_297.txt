Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  10  20  12  67  56  91  66
1  74  55  87  49  82  11  80  57
2  80  57  76  74  27  77  10  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 10 20 12 67 56 91 66]
 [74 55 87 49 82 11 80 57]
 [80 57 76 74 27 77 10 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can start by calculating the total valuations for each agent and then proceed to allocate the items to balance the valuations as evenly as possible.

Valuations:
- Agent 0: 21, 10, 20, 12, 67, 56, 91, 66 (Total: 343)
- Agent 1: 74, 55, 87, 49, 82, 11, 80, 57 (Total: 495)
- Agent 2: 80, 57, 76, 74, 27, 77, 10, 71 (Total: 472)

By considering the relative valuations and aiming to maximize the value for each agent, we can propose the following allocations:

1. Start by assigning the highest value items to each agent to balance the total value as much as possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair number of items, balancing both total value and item count.

Here is one potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Assign items that are highly valued by Agent 0 and less valued by others.
- Agent 1: Assign items that Agent 1 values highly compared to others.
- Agent 2: Assign items that Agent 2 values highly compared to others.

A possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, 5

Let's verify:

- Agent 0: Values for items 6 and 7 are 91 and 66. Total value: 157
- Agent 1: Values for items 0, 2, and 4 are 74, 87, and 82. Total value: 243
- Agent 2: Values for items 1, 3, and 5 are 57, 74, and 77. Total value: 208

This allocation balances both the number of items and the total value reasonably well, while ensuring that only 8 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
