Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  90  98  44  41  48  25  21
1  78  49  55  21  72  12  67  93
2  36  93  82   5  86  51  82  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 90 98 44 41 48 25 21]
 [78 49 55 21 72 12 67 93]
 [36 93 82  5 86 51 82 38]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 3 agents and 8 items, this is feasible). Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items that agent 0 values highly. These are items 0, 1, and 2, with valuations of 96, 90, and 98, respectively. Assign these high-value items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: After agent 0 has taken items 0, 1, and 2, look at the remaining items. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (93), followed by item 4 (72). Assign items 4 and 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: With items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 allocated, the remaining items are 3, 5, and 6. Agent 2 values item 6 (82) and item 5 (51) the most among the remaining options, so assign these to agent 2. The only remaining item is item 3, which can also go to agent 2 as it has no other competition for it.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes their individual valuations based on the remaining choices.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
