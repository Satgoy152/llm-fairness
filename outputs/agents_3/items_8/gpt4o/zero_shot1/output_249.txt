Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  91  46  38  43  89  66  81
1  14  90  80  87  48  89  78  10
2  41  63  77   0  18  38  66  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent derives from the items they receive. A possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest value an agent places on them, ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent and each agent is considered for multiple items.

Let's allocate the items by checking each agent's valuation and making sure the allocation is as fair as possible:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 94
   - Item 1: 91
   - Item 5: 89
   - Item 7: 81
   - Item 6: 66
   - Item 2: 46
   - Item 4: 43
   - Item 3: 38

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 1: 90
   - Item 5: 89
   - Item 3: 87
   - Item 2: 80
   - Item 6: 78
   - Item 4: 48
   - Item 0: 14
   - Item 7: 10

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 2: 77
   - Item 1: 63
   - Item 6: 66
   - Item 5: 38
   - Item 0: 41
   - Item 7: 36
   - Item 4: 18
   - Item 3: 0

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1 (highest values for these items).
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 5 (highest values for these items).
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 4, 6, and 7 (highest values for remaining items).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of their highest valued items.
