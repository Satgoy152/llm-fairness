Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  92  24  79  57  98  15  74
1  96  38  44  72   7  68   0  80
2   5  14  88  82  48  94  88  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 38 44 72  7 68  0 80]
 [ 5 14 88 82 48 94 88 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to achieve this. Let's go through the process:

1. **List all items with their valuations for each agent:**

   ```
   Agent 0: [43, 92, 24, 79, 57, 98, 15, 74]
   Agent 1: [96, 38, 44, 72, 7, 68, 0, 80]
   Agent 2: [5, 14, 88, 82, 48, 94, 88, 13]
   ```

2. **Allocate items by choosing the maximum valuation for each item:**

   - **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most at 82.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the most at 57.
   - **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
   - **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
   - **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it the most at 80.

3. **Compile the allocations:**

   ```
   Agent 0: [1, 4, 5]
   Agent 1: [0, 7]
   Agent 2: [2, 3, 6]
   ```

4. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their preferences.
