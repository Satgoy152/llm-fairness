Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  90  46  69  25  39  41   1
1   7  22  39  26  56  85   6  54
2  30  54  50  61  48  96  67  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We will aim for an allocation where each agent gets an approximately equal total value, considering their preferences. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Considerations:**
   - There are 3 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent should ideally get around 2-3 items given the total number of items.

2. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items to get an understanding of their preferences.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to agents starting with the highest individual valuations and ensuring each agent receives a fair share of their total preferred value.

4. **Allocation Steps:**
   - Start by assigning items with the highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal share.
   - Balance allocations to ensure all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair number.

5. **Item Allocation:**

   - Assign item 5 to agent 2 (highest value 96).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0 (highest value 90).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 61).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 49).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 56).
   - Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 54).
   - Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 67).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 39).

Given these steps, we aim for a balanced allocation based on preferences and total values. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
