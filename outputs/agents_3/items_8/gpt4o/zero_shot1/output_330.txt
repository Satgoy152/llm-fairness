Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  12  40  60  57  25  92   1
1  63  29  61  20  54  23  65  24
2  96  82  79  96   2  98   5  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 29 61 20 54 23 65 24]
 [96 82 79 96  2 98  5 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. One method to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least some items. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (92), so assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (61), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (98), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Next, we assign the remaining items considering the highest remaining valuations:
  - Agent 2 values item 0 highly (96), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
  - Agent 2 also values item 3 highly (96), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
  - Agent 2 values item 1 highly (82), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
  - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (54), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
  - Finally, Agent 0 values item 7 the most (1), so assign item 7 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, maximizing their valuations where possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```
