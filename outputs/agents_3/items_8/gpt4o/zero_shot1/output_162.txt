Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  82  57  25  42  25  46  24
1  94  92   7  54  57  23  57   5
2  83   6  70  88  10  14  83  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable total value of items based on their valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Use these totals to guide the allocation, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 45 + 82 + 57 + 25 + 42 + 25 + 46 + 24 = 346
- Agent 1: 94 + 92 + 7 + 54 + 57 + 23 + 57 + 5 = 389
- Agent 2: 83 + 6 + 70 + 88 + 10 + 14 + 83 + 44 = 398

Now, we will allocate items to balance the overall satisfaction:

1. Assign items to agents to maximize their utility based on their highest valuations.
2. Ensure each agent gets some items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 6, and 2.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: [1, 5] 
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 6]

This allocation gives each agent items they highly value while ensuring all items are distributed.

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
