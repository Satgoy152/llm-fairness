Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  80  28  72  80  66  28  11
1  81  37  36  72  84  99  51  51
2  73  18  66  45  26  81  90   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that we maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents.

2. **Balance the allocations**: If this initial allocation results in any agent receiving too many items, we may need to adjust by reassigning some items to other agents who also value them reasonably well.

3. **Ensure fairness**: Each agent should receive approximately the same number of items, or as close as possible, given the constraint of 8 items and 3 agents.

**Allocating Items:**

- **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (81 each), assigned to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (80), assigned to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (66), assigned to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Valued equally by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (72 each), assigned to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (84), assigned to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (99), assigned to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (90), assigned to Agent 2.
- **Item 7**: Valued highest by Agent 1 and Agent 2 (51 and 1 respectively), assigned to Agent 1.

Now, we check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6

This allocation results in a fair distribution of items among the agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
