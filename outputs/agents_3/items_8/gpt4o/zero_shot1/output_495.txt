Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  93  37  96  45  22  42  31
1  91  45  51  99  96  21   5  30
2  40  73   0  21  11  97  91  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Highest: Item 3 (96), Item 1 (93), Item 0 (67)
  
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 
  - Highest: Item 3 (99), Item 4 (96), Item 0 (91)

- Agent 2 values the items as follows: 
  - Highest: Item 5 (97), Item 6 (91), Item 1 (73)

Now, let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them in a manner where no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Allocations:

- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 99, highest available value).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 67).
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (value 97).

Continue allocating the next highest value items that are not yet assigned:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 96).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 93).
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 91).

We have allocated 6 items so far. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 37, next highest for this agent).
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2 (value 42).

All items are now allocated. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 8 items fairly among the agents.
