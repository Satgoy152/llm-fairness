Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  22  61  47  17  53  46  99
1  61   9   7  74  15  96  24  11
2  18  46   1  54  77  18  66  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 22 61 47 17 53 46 99]
 [61  9  7 74 15 96 24 11]
 [18 46  1 54 77 18 66 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the valuations and ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of items. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (99), so allocate item 7 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (96), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (77), so allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has one item. We continue allocating the remaining items with a balance of maximizing valuations and ensuring each agent gets roughly the same number of items:

4. Agent 0 also values item 2 highly (61), allocate item 2 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 0 highly (61), allocate item 0 to agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 6 highly (66), allocate item 6 to agent 2.

At this point, agents 0 and 2 have two items each, and agent 1 has two items. We have two items left to allocate (1 and 3):

7. Agent 0 values item 3 (47) the highest among the remaining items, allocate item 3 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 values item 1 (9) higher than agent 2, allocate item 1 to agent 1.

Now, all items are allocated fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 3],
    "1": [5, 0, 1],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
