Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  57  48  59  54  84  77  98
1  47  23  56  17  50  75  32  42
2  76  44  64   9  94  27  37  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair portion of the items based on their valuations.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 7 (98), 5 (84), 6 (77), 3 (59), 4 (54)
   - Allocate items 7 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (75), 0 (47), 2 (56), 4 (50)
   - Allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (94), 0 (76), 2 (64), 1 (44)
   - Allocate items 4, 2, and 0 to Agent 2.

Re-evaluating to ensure all 8 items are distributed and no conflicts occur:

- We start again by distributing items prioritizing the highest value for each agent.
- Agent 0 receives items 7 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 2, 6, and 1.

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 2, 6, 1]
}
```
