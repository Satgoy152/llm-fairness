Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  22  54  23  32  79  68  79
1  72  31  87  21  28  97  32  85
2  70  19  89  13  81  93  74   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 22 54 23 32 79 68 79]
 [72 31 87 21 28 97 32 85]
 [70 19 89 13 81 93 74  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that prioritizes maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. 

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (89).
2. Assign item 5 to agent 1 because agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (97).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (81).
4. Assign item 7 to agent 1 because agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7 (85).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (80).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 2 because agent 2 has a high valuation for item 6 (74).
7. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (23).
8. Assign item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (22).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets a share of the items based on their valuations.
