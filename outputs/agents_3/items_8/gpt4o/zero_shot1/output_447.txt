Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  68  30  99  83  19  14  99
1  57  83  28  50  43  14  90  37
2  37  28   1   5  23  95   3  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for a distribution where each agent gets approximately the same total value, if possible. We can approach this problem by prioritizing items based on their value to each agent.

Let's analyze the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 7 (99), Item 0 (69), Item 1 (68), Item 4 (83)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (83), Item 6 (90), Item 0 (57)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (95), Item 0 (37)

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Assign high-value items: 3 (99), 7 (99)
  - Remaining total for Agent 0: 198

- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign high-value items: 1 (83), 6 (90)
  - Remaining total for Agent 1: 173

- **Agent 2**:
  - Assign high-value items: 5 (95), 0 (37)
  - Remaining total for Agent 2: 132

Now, allocate the remaining items (2, 4):

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they have a higher valuation for it compared to others.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 2 has the least interest.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 4],
    "1": [1, 6, 2],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.
