Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  60  96  43  84  23  63  79
1   4   3  76  57  31  63  48  76
2  39  45  25  13  13  66  20  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 4 (84), Item 7 (79)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (76), Item 7 (76), Item 5 (63)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (66), Item 1 (45), Item 0 (39)

From the above, we will attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations:

- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: This item has the highest value for Agent 0.
- **Allocate item 7 to Agent 1**: This item has a high value for Agent 1.
- **Allocate items 5 and 1 to Agent 2**: These items have high values for Agent 2.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation ensuring all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 2, 3, 4 (highest values for Agent 0 after the initial allocation)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 7, 6 (highest available values for Agent 1)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items: 5, 1, 0 (remaining items with high values for Agent 2)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [5, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their valuations, maximizing their respective total value gained from the items.
