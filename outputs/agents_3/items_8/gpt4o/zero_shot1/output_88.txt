Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  68  89  82  69  53   3  64
1  47  98  50  67  25  76  76  76
2  68  27  17  28  65   0  61  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 68 89 82 69 53  3 64]
 [47 98 50 67 25 76 76 76]
 [68 27 17 28 65  0 61 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Top valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 0 (84), Item 3 (82)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Top valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 5 (76), Item 6 (76), Item 7 (76)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Top valuations: Item 0 (68), Item 4 (65), Item 7 (62)

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign them their top choices that don't clash with others' top choices.
  - Items: [0, 2]

- **Agent 1**: Assign them their highest-valued items.
  - Items: [1, 5, 6]

- **Agent 2**: Assign them items that are not highly valued by others and some of their top choices.
  - Items: [3, 4, 7]

Let's check to ensure all items are allocated:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4, 7]

Total items allocated: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8

This allocation distributes the items based on maximizing each agent's top preferences while ensuring all items are assigned.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
