Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  57  49  46  70  19  52  77
1   6   3  31  80  25  65  12  84
2  51  85  37  53   9  79  83  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify each agent's preference for items**: Each agent values items differently, so we should aim to give each agent the items they value the most.

2. **Allocate items to maximize total value**: We should ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

3. **Distribute items fairly**: Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should get either 2 or 3 items. The distribution should be as even as possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on these principles:

- Agent 0 values items 4, 7, and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 3, 7, and 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 1, 5, and 6 highly.

By considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets a fair share, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4 and 7
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2, and 6

Now, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and all 8 items are allocated.
