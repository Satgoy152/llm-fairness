Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  93  15  54  55  41  37  13
1  79  56  68  23  56  24  19  41
2  15  91  42  23  94  37  16  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We also need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items, given there are 3 agents and 8 items in total.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the distribution remains fair.
2. After assigning each item, check if any agent has significantly more or fewer items than others.
3. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure a more balanced distribution while trying to maintain a high total valuation for each agent.

Let's go through this process:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 1 (79), so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (91), so assign to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 1 (68), so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 0 (54), so assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 2 (94), so assign to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 0 (41), so assign to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 0 (37), so assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 1 (41), so assign to Agent 1.

After this initial allocation, check the distribution:

- Agent 0 has items: [3, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 has items: [0, 2, 7]
- Agent 2 has items: [1, 4]

This gives us a total of 8 items distributed. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable number of items, and the allocation is made based on their highest valuations.
