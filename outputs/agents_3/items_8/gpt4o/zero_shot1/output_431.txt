Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  33  92  90  78  15  81  43
1  31  10  57  70  17  89   6  67
2  92  14  64   8  41  43  31  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 10 57 70 17 89  6 67]
 [92 14 64  8 41 43 31 84]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to examine the valuations and distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction or value.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [70, 33, 92, 90, 78, 15, 81, 43]
- Agent 1 values: [31, 10, 57, 70, 17, 89, 6, 67]
- Agent 2 values: [92, 14, 64, 8, 41, 43, 31, 84]

We will allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the remaining items, maintaining a balanced distribution:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 92).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 92).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 89).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 90).
5. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 84).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 81).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 14).
8. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 17).

Thus, the allocations can be represented in the requested JSON format as:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations for the unallocated items.
