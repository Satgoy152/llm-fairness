Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  98  69  31  72  80  79  74
1  99  20  88  92  90  44  85  54
2   9  71  73  93  36  53  73  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. The table of valuations suggests that each agent values different items differently, so we will try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they receive all items. This helps us understand the preference distribution.
2. Assign items to agents based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Check the allocation to ensure all 8 items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value items for agent 0 are item 1 (98) and item 5 (80).
- **Agent 1**: The highest value items for agent 1 are item 0 (99) and item 3 (92).
- **Agent 2**: The highest value items for agent 2 are item 3 (93) and item 2 (73).

Now, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (98) and item 5 (80).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (99) and item 4 (90).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (93), item 2 (73), item 6 (73), and item 7 (13).

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
