Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  93  57  76  66  53  30  10
1   3  69   6  82  38  24  12  65
2  46  63  78  75  49  59  54  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 69  6 82 38 24 12 65]
 [46 63 78 75 49 59 54 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent derives from the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 3 (76)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 7 (65)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (80), Item 2 (78)

We need to ensure each agent gets items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while also ensuring all items are distributed.

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0:** Receives Items [0, 1]
  - Total valuation = 12 (Item 0) + 93 (Item 1) = 105
  
- **Agent 1:** Receives Items [3, 4, 6]
  - Total valuation = 82 (Item 3) + 38 (Item 4) + 12 (Item 6) = 132

- **Agent 2:** Receives Items [2, 5, 7]
  - Total valuation = 78 (Item 2) + 59 (Item 5) + 80 (Item 7) = 217

This allocation ensures:
- Each agent receives a fair distribution based on their highest valuations.
- All 8 items are allocated.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
