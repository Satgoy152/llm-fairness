Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84   3  32  87  12  64  45  14
1  63   1  51  38  10  77  31  49
2  81  87  88  27  37  33  54  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every agent gets at least one item. We can do this by iteratively assigning the highest-valued unallocated item to the agent who values it most, until each agent has at least one item. After that, we'll continue to allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's break down the allocations step-by-step:

1. **Initial Allocation (Each agent gets at least one item):**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (87).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (77).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (88).

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 next highest (87).
   - Agent 0 values item 0 next highest (84).
   - Agent 2 values item 7 next highest (56).
   - Agent 0 values item 5 next highest (64) but it's already taken by Agent 1, so consider the next best.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 but it's already taken, so consider the next best.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 next (45).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 but it's already taken, so consider the next best.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 but it's already taken, so consider the next best.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 but it's already taken, so consider the next best.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 next (10).

Now let's construct the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
