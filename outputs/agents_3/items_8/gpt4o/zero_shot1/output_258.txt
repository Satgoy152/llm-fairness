Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  12  96   1  43  59  93  94
1  69  68  12  34   9  67  92   7
2  95  69  64  96  96  22  92  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 68 12 34  9 67 92  7]
 [95 69 64 96 96 22 92 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 2 (value 96) and item 7 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent can be given item 0 (value 69) and item 6 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent can be allocated items 3 (value 96), 4 (value 96), and item 5 (value 22).

Now, let's check if all items have been allocated:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: 2, 7
- Items allocated to Agent 1: 0, 6
- Items allocated to Agent 2: 3, 4, 5

Items 1 is still unallocated. Let's assign it to Agent 0 as they have some capacity for more items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 5

All items have been allocated, and each agent has received items. Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
