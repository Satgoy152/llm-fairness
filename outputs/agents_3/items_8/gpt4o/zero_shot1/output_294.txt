Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  48  83  68  10  60  87  19
1  37  21  17   0  74  18  35  62
2  19  86  28  95  84  97   5  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider strategies like maximizing the total valuation, balancing the number of items each agent receives, or ensuring each agent's preferences are considered. Here, I'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets nearly equal value based on their preferences. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4, 7, and 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5, 3, and 7.

Let's assign items considering these preferences:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 83)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 87)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 37)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 74)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 62)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 95)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 97)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 86)

This allocation tries to respect each agent's high preferences while distributing the items fairly among the agents. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 1]
}
```
