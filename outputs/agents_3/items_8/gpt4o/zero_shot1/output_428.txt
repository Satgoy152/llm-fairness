Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  75  78  66  77  46  55  20
1  39  31  95   1  61  20  63  83
2  72  98  95  73  86  72  12   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 75 78 66 77 46 55 20]
 [39 31 95  1 61 20 63 83]
 [72 98 95 73 86 72 12  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (72).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (98).
3. Item 2: Agents 1 and 2 value it the most (95), but since Agent 2 already has two items, let's give it to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (73).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (86).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (46).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (63).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (83).

Now, we check the allocation to ensure each agent has at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 3, 4]

All items are allocated, and each agent has a fair share given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
