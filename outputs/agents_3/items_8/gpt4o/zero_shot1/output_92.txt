Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  63  10  96  78  26  75  73
1   0  81  38  67  21  36  64  11
2  56  25  29  25  87  77  10  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 25 29 25 87 77 10 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 (96) and 1 (63).
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (81) and 3 (67).
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 (87) and 5 (77).

A possible approach is to:

- Allocate high-value items from each agent's perspective, aiming to balance the total value each agent receives.
- Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 96).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 81).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 87).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 52).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (value 77).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 75).
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 38).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (value 75).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, 6 (total value 52 + 96 + 75 = 223).
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2 (total value 81 + 38 = 119).
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 5, 7 (total value 87 + 77 + 75 = 239).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation among the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
