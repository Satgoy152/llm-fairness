Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  76   6  76  19  80   9  89
1  20  86  93   6  24  94  79  16
2  29  25  10  71  83  20   9  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 86 93  6 24 94 79 16]
 [29 25 10 71 83 20  9 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- 0: 21
- 1: 76
- 2: 6
- 3: 76
- 4: 19
- 5: 80
- 6: 9
- 7: 89

Agent 1:
- 0: 20
- 1: 86
- 2: 93
- 3: 6
- 4: 24
- 5: 94
- 6: 79
- 7: 16

Agent 2:
- 0: 29
- 1: 25
- 2: 10
- 3: 71
- 4: 83
- 5: 20
- 6: 9
- 7: 84

To allocate fairly, let's follow these steps:
1. Analyze the highest valuation each agent has for the items.
2. Assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

After analyzing the valuations and ensuring fairness while maximizing satisfaction:

- Agent 0 should receive items: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 1 should receive items: [2, 6]
- Agent 2 should receive items: [0, 4, 7]

This ensures each agent gets a fair allocation based on their preferences and no item is assigned more than once.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
