Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  94  19  63  93  79  17  87
1  29  44  42  67  70  20  70  50
2  88  26  15  66  16   2  75  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can start by evaluating the value each agent places on each item and distribute the items accordingly.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (94), so we can allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 places a high value on item 3 (67), so we can assign it to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 highly (88), so we can allocate item 0 to agent 2.

We continue this process by examining other items:

4. Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (93), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 6 (70) highly, so we can allocate item 6 to agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 7 (34) more than the other agents, so we can allocate item 7 to agent 2.

For the remaining items:

7. Agent 0 values item 5 (79) more than the other agents, so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 values item 2 (42) more than the others, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and we distribute all 8 items. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```
