Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  22  21  14  23  57  28  64
1  80  70  17  56  94   5  59  65
2  71  29  22  13  53  10   2  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with the highest valuations: 64, 57, 28
   - Allocate items 7, 5, and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with the highest valuations: 94, 80, 70
   - Allocate items 4, 0, and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items: 2, 3
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some items and attempts to maximize their total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 3 agents.
