Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5  6   7
0  51  57  12  93  32  18  5  66
1  74  27  56  97  60  72  8  34
2  70  86  92  40  12  14  8   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, taking into account the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items must be allocated. We can use a simple heuristic approach for this allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (93), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (97), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (72), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (92), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Now, let's continue with the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 1 (57), allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 0 (74), allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest valued item is item 1 (86), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 0 (70), but it's also allocated. The next highest is item 3 (40), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 4 (12), allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Continue with the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 0 (51), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 7 (66), allocate item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 4 (60), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 7 (34), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 6 (8), allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest valued item is item 5 (14), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 6 (8), but it's allocated. The next highest is item 7 (4), allocate item 7 to agent 2.

At this point, all items have been allocated, but there seems to be an inconsistency in the allocation. Let's correct and finalize the allocation:

- Correct allocation for agent 0: [3, 1, 7]
- Correct allocation for agent 1: [5, 0]
- Correct allocation for agent 2: [2, 4, 6]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 7],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while respecting the constraint of allocating exactly 8 items in total.
