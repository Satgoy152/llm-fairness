Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  80   6  55  30  40  91  79
1  69  54  33   3  39  83  16  52
2  72  68   1  93  18  36  57  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 80  6 55 30 40 91 79]
 [69 54 33  3 39 83 16 52]
 [72 68  1 93 18 36 57 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, a reasonable approach is to maximize the total value received by all agents combined.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [45, 80, 6, 55, 30, 40, 91, 79]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [69, 54, 33, 3, 39, 83, 16, 52]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [72, 68, 1, 93, 18, 36, 57, 15]

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest unique value for each item across agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 91).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 93).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 83).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 80).
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 79).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 72).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 33).
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 39).

This ensures that each agent receives a reasonable allocation of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
