Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  85  26  54  49  39  47  10
1  98   5   1  44   9  84  47  27
2  89  93  72  89  82  39   9  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 85 26 54 49 39 47 10]
 [98  5  1 44  9 84 47 27]
 [89 93 72 89 82 39  9 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's values: 96, 85, 26, 54, 49, 39, 47, 10  
Agent 1's values: 98, 5, 1, 44, 9, 84, 47, 27  
Agent 2's values: 89, 93, 72, 89, 82, 39, 9, 54

One possible approach is to allocate the items to the agent who values them the most, making sure each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's perform this allocation step-by-step:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (98).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (72).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 89. Let's assign it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (82).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (84).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 47. Let's assign it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (54).

Let's check the item counts:
- Agent 0: 2 items (3, 6)
- Agent 1: 2 items (0, 5)
- Agent 2: 4 items (1, 2, 4, 7)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items while considering their valuations. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
