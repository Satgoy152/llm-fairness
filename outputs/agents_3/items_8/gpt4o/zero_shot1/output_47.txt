Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35   8  30  73  50  63  38  21
1  63  19  87  10  70  82  13  74
2  59  27  10  87  70  19  58  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35  8 30 73 50 63 38 21]
 [63 19 87 10 70 82 13 74]
 [59 27 10 87 70 19 58 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated equals 8. We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution.

1. **Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:**

   - Agent 0: 35 + 8 + 30 + 73 + 50 + 63 + 38 + 21 = 318
   - Agent 1: 63 + 19 + 87 + 10 + 70 + 82 + 13 + 74 = 418
   - Agent 2: 59 + 27 + 10 + 87 + 70 + 19 + 58 + 37 = 367

2. **Allocate items to each agent by trying to maximize each agent's total value:**

   - **Agent 0:** 
     - Highest value items: 3 (73), 5 (63)
     - Allocate items: 3, 5

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Highest value items: 2 (87), 5 (82), 7 (74)
     - Allocate items: 2, 7

   - **Agent 2:**
     - Highest value items: 3 (87), 4 (70)
     - Allocate items: 3, 4

3. **Resolve conflicts and ensure each agent has a fair number of items:**

   - Agent 0 and Agent 2 both want item 3. Since Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (87), allocate it to Agent 2.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure a fair distribution and no conflicts.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: 0, 1 (values: 35, 8)
   - Agent 1: 2, 5, 7 (values: 87, 82, 74)
   - Agent 2: 3, 4, 6 (values: 87, 70, 58)

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
