Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  66  22  91  73  79  68  32
1  36  23  68  62  67  54  27  20
2  29  77  59  68   4  59  19  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 77 59 68  4 59 19 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest-valued items for Agent 0 are: Item 3 (91), Item 5 (79), Item 4 (73), Item 0 (69), Item 1 (66).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest-valued items for Agent 1 are: Item 2 (68), Item 4 (67), Item 3 (62).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest-valued items for Agent 2 are: Item 1 (77), Item 3 (68), Item 2 (59).

By balancing these, we can aim for a fair distribution:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 91)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 77)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 68)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation: 73)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (third highest valuation: 79)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (fourth highest valuation: 69)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (valuation: 27)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (valuation: 42)

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives a fair distribution of items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the available items.
