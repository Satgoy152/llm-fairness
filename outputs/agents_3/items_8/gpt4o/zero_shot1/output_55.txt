Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  62   0  11  39  61  79  84
1  57  14  32  41  37  95   6  67
2  95  25  80  22  32  68  77  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 62  0 11 39 61 79 84]
 [57 14 32 41 37 95  6 67]
 [95 25 80 22 32 68 77 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure each agent receives a reasonable value based on their preferences. Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is relatively balanced.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [5, 62, 0, 11, 39, 61, 79, 84]
- **Agent 1**: [57, 14, 32, 41, 37, 95, 6, 67]
- **Agent 2**: [95, 25, 80, 22, 32, 68, 77, 22]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with values 79 and 84, and also has a high valuation for item 61.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 95 and has a relatively high valuation for item 67.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items with values 95, 80, and 77.

### Allocation:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because they have a relatively high valuation for it.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 because they have a relatively high valuation for it.

### Final Allocations:
Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
