Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  83  13  56  86  73  43   6
1  79  97   8  96   0  69  44  39
2  84   7  99  70  59  81   9   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 83 13 56 86 73 43  6]
 [79 97  8 96  0 69 44 39]
 [84  7 99 70 59 81  9  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets based on their individual preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation by analyzing the valuations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** [71, 83, 13, 56, 86, 73, 43, 6]
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** [79, 97, 8, 96, 0, 69, 44, 39]
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** [84, 7, 99, 70, 59, 81, 9, 0]

A reasonable approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring no conflicts:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (84)
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (97)
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (99)
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96)
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (86)
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (81)
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (44)
- **Item 7:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (39)

Now let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3, 6, 7]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on each agent's valuation. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
