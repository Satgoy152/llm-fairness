Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  33  99  19  38  80   3  40
1   9  79   2  11  22  77   0  40
2  84  79  69  39  18  17  95  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent. A common approach is to assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (99) and 0 (81).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (79) and 5 (77).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 6 (95) and 0 (84).

To balance the distribution, let's start allocating by focusing on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items 2 and 0. These are the items with the highest valuation for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Assign items 1 and 5. These items have high valuations for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Assign items 6 and attempt to optimize further with remaining items, considering the next highest valuations.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3, 4, and 7) to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values item 3 (39) more than Agent 1 (11) or Agent 0 (19).
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values item 4 (38) more than Agent 1 (22) or Agent 2 (18).
- **Item 7:** Agent 1 values item 7 (40) equally with Agent 0, but since Agent 1 has fewer items, we give it to Agent 1.

Therefore, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 0, and 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5, and 7
- Agent 2: Items 6 and 3

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
