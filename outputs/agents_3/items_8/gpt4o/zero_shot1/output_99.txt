Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  21  27  97  51  32  28   6
1  87  28   7  19  33  44  14  68
2  76  13  30  54  28  23  57  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 21 27 97 51 32 28  6]
 [87 28  7 19 33 44 14 68]
 [76 13 30 54 28 23 57 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The following strategy can be applied to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.
2. Try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total value.

Let's go through the calculations:

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 63 + 21 + 27 + 97 + 51 + 32 + 28 + 6 = 325
- Agent 1: 87 + 28 + 7 + 19 + 33 + 44 + 14 + 68 = 300
- Agent 2: 76 + 13 + 30 + 54 + 28 + 23 + 57 + 80 = 361

### Allocation Strategy:
We will allocate items by identifying the highest valuation for each item and assigning it to the respective agent, while trying to balance the number of items each agent receives.

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (87)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (21)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (30)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (51)
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (44)
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (57)
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (80)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6, 7

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.
