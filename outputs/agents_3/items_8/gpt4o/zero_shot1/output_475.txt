Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  26  13  93  56  86  48  29
1  11  65  25  52  95  21  48  85
2  94   4  37  12  29  45  19  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will consider a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (93), Item 5 (86)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (95), Item 7 (85)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (94), Item 2 (37)
   
Given these preferences, we will allocate the remaining items considering the next highest values:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (26) and 6 (48) have decent values for this agent.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (52) and Item 5 (21) have reasonable value.
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (46) has a good value for this agent.

Based on maximizing value and ensuring each agent gets a fair share, we can allocate as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their valuations.
