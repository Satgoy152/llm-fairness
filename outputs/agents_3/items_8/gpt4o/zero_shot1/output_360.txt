Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  93  49  23  17  17  74  30
1  37   2  20  40  65   7   4  61
2  99  65  90  10  41  88  59  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 65 90 10 41 88 59 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Let's consider a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Based on the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Values items 1 (93) and 6 (74) highly.

Agent 1:
- Values items 4 (65) and 7 (61) highly.

Agent 2:
- Values items 0 (99) and 2 (90) highly.

Let's allocate items based on these high valuations:

- Assign item 1 and item 6 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 and item 7 to agent 1.
- Assign item 0 and item 2 to agent 2.

Now, we have 6 items allocated. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (3 and 5) in a way that maintains fairness:

- For item 3, agent 1 has a higher valuation (40) than agents 0 (23) and 2 (10). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- For item 5, agent 2 has a higher valuation (88) than agents 0 (17) and 1 (7). Assign item 5 to agent 2.

Now all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 5]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
