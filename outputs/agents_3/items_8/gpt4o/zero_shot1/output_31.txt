Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  99  77  41  67  65  61  69
1  31  62  16  55  92   4  84  83
2   5  84  82   6  54   9  88  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agentâ€™s total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 2 very highly. So, we can assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values items 4, 6, and 7 highly. So, we can assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 highly, and Agent 0 and Agent 1 have already received their share of items, leaving item 3 as the remaining item. So, we can assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations, ensuring all 8 items are allocated.
