Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  92  40  77  67  21   1  25
1  12  10  30  15  80  48  65  27
2   5  90  13  73  69  78  41  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items they are allocated. One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be determined:

1. Examine each item and determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.

Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 at 12, and Agent 2 at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 at 10, and Agent 2 at 90. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 30, and Agent 2 at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 15, and Agent 2 at 73. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 80, and Agent 2 at 69. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 48, and Agent 2 at 78. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 65, and Agent 2 at 41. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 27, and Agent 2 at 59. Assign to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
