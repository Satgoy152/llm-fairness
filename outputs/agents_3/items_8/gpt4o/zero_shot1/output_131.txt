Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  46  95  89  63  94  16  53
1  58  14  77  91  91  40  65  19
2  13  27  29  85  56   5  55  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 0 without leaving other agents with very low total values.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 1, considering what's left after Agent 0's allocation.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign the remaining items to Agent 2, ensuring they also receive some of their higher-value items.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** has high values for items 2 and 5.
- **Agent 1** has high values for items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 2** has high values for items 7.

Based on these observations, a fair allocation considering the values could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 7

Let's confirm this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 5 with values of 95 and 94.
- Agent 1 gets items 3, 4, and 6 with values of 91, 91, and 65.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 7 with values of 13, 27, and 98.

Each agent receives items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```
