Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  23   1  34  37  10  82   6
1   2  38  71  66  26  85   2   2
2  95  81  96  89  36  54   9  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One simple method is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valued items, ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (82), Item 0 (75), Item 3 (34)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (85), Item 2 (71), Item 3 (66)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (96), Item 0 (95), Item 3 (89)

2. **Allocate items based on the highest value each agent has for any unallocated item:**
   - Start with the highest values across all agents:
     - Item 2 is most valued by Agent 2 (96).
     - Item 5 is most valued by Agent 1 (85).
     - Item 6 is most valued by Agent 0 (82).
     - Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2 (95).
     - Item 3 is most valued by Agent 2 (89).
     - Item 1 is most valued by Agent 2 (81).
     - Item 4 is most valued by Agent 0 (37).
     - Item 7 is most valued by Agent 2 (40).

3. **Ensure all items are allocated to only one agent:**

   Allocate items as follows:
   - Agent 0: [6, 4]
   - Agent 1: [5]
   - Agent 2: [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]

4. **Verify the allocation:**
   - All items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] are allocated.
   - Each agent gets a fair allocation based on their highest valued items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
