Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  63  63  39   0  62   1  93
1  17  30   1   2  97  96  82   1
2  85  66  91  79  73  20   7  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 66 91 79 73 20  7 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuations, we can utilize a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items:

Let's consider the following steps:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Check the total number of items each agent receives and adjust if necessary to ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Using this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (66).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (79).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (97).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (82).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (93).

Now, let's distribute the items fairly:

- Assign items 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0, 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
