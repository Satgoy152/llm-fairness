Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  57  35  37  70  44   9  31
1  70  42  35  59  71  69  24  74
2  28   1  80  33  91  90  62  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 42 35 59 71 69 24 74]
 [28  1 80 33 91 90 62 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuation matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  57  35  37  70  44   9  31
1  70  42  35  59  71  69  24  74
2  28   1  80  33  91  90  62  12
```

We aim to distribute these items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are assigned.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Consider items that have relatively higher values for Agent 0 compared to others, but also not the highest for other agents to ensure fairness.
   - Possible items for allocation: 1 (57), 3 (37)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0 (70) and 4 (71), but we also need to balance allocations.
   - Possible items for allocation: 0 (70), 7 (74)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 (80), 4 (91), and 5 (90).
   - Possible items for allocation: 2 (80), 5 (90), 6 (62)

### Fair Allocation

Given the constraints and the goal of fairness, one approach is to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering the values:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 4, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This JSON object represents the allocation of items to each agent, ensuring each gets a fair share according to the given valuations.
