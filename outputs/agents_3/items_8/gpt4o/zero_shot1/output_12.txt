Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  57  98  69  86  52  84   0
1  52  11  62   6  10  39  42  85
2  50  43  83  69  12  64  65  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One common method is to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible, while ensuring each item is assigned to one and only one agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent places on each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 57.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
- Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 69. To balance, give it to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 64.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 65.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.

After this allocation, Agent 0 has 4 items, Agent 1 has none, and Agent 2 has 4 items. To balance the allocation:

Reallocate:
- Move Item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 has many items.
- Move Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 has many items.

Now, each agent gets at least two items. Let's finalize the allocation:

Agent 0: [0, 2]
Agent 1: [1, 4]
Agent 2: [3, 5, 6, 7]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
