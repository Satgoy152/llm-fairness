Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   0   8  16   4  85  87   7
1  47  65  18  77  61  48  91  77
2  46  42  87  54  42  13  65  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 42 87 54 42 13 65 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items.

First, let's assign each agent a roughly equal number of items. Since we have 3 agents and 8 items, one possible fair allocation would be to give two agents 3 items each and one agent 2 items.

Next, we will consider the valuations to maximize each agent's total valuation.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 23, 0, 8, 16, 4, 85, 87, 7
- **Agent 1:** 47, 65, 18, 77, 61, 48, 91, 77
- **Agent 2:** 46, 42, 87, 54, 42, 13, 65, 16

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0 (3 items):** Prioritize items with the highest valuations: 6 (87), 5 (85), 0 (23).
2. **Agent 1 (3 items):** Prioritize items: 6 (91), 3 (77), 7 (77).
3. **Agent 2 (2 items):** Prioritize items: 2 (87), 0 (46).

### Adjustments:
- Item 6 is highly valued by all agents. However, since Agent 1 has the highest valuation for it, allocate it to Agent 1.
- Adjust Agent 0's allocation by replacing item 6 with another high-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.
- Re-evaluate allocations to ensure no items are duplicated and all items are fairly distributed.

### Final Allocations:
- **Agent 0:** Items [5, 1, 4]
- **Agent 1:** Items [6, 3, 7]
- **Agent 2:** Items [0, 2]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 4],
    "1": [6, 3, 7],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items while maximizing total valuations based on the available data.
