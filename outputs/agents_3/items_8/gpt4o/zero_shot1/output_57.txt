Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  27  15  34  48  25   3  26
1  76  25   8   9  17   2  76  51
2  56  37  42  21  36  19  63  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[31 27 15 34 48 25  3 26]
 [76 25  8  9 17  2 76 51]
 [56 37 42 21 36 19 63 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 3 agents and 8 items, each agent should receive approximately 2 to 3 items.

Let's evaluate the best allocation strategy based on the given valuations.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (48), Item 3 (34), Item 0 (31)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (76), Item 6 (76), Item 7 (51)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (79), Item 6 (63), Item 0 (56)

Allocate based on maximizing each agent's high-value items while ensuring all items are assigned:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items: [3, 4]
  - Total valuation: 34 + 48 = 82

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items: [0, 6]
  - Total valuation: 76 + 76 = 152

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items: [5, 7, 1, 2]
  - Total valuation: 19 + 79 + 37 + 42 = 177

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 7, 1, 2]
}
```
