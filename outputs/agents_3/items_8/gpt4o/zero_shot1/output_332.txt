Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  51  25  32  63  81  78  79
1  19  75  56   9  62  20  42  89
2   8  64  71  94  88  27  99  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 75 56  9 62 20 42 89]
 [ 8 64 71 94 88 27 99 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible fair allocation approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 34 + 51 + 25 + 32 + 63 + 81 + 78 + 79 = 443
   - Agent 1: 19 + 75 + 56 + 9 + 62 + 20 + 42 + 89 = 372
   - Agent 2: 8 + 64 + 71 + 94 + 88 + 27 + 99 + 63 = 514

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations**:
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize their satisfaction.

Based on the valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 5: 81
  - Item 6: 78

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 4: 62
  - Item 7: 89

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 0: 8

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent gets a fair distribution based on their valuation preferences.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 0]
}
```

This allocation aligns with the goal of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations of the items, while ensuring the rules of the allocation are respected (integer number of items per agent and all items allocated).
