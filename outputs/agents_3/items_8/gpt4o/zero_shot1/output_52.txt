Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47   5  30  76  12  85  55  50
1  47  76  54   4  29  98  35  51
2  32  65  93  50  61  92  50  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 65 93 50 61 92 50 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives a similar number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 2-3 items.

Let's assign the items to the agents based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 5: Value 85
   - Item 3: Value 76
   - Total value for Agent 0: 161

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1: Value 76
   - Item 5: Value 98
   - Total value for Agent 1: 174

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2: Value 93
   - Item 6: Value 50
   - Item 7: Value 64
   - Total value for Agent 2: 207

Now letâ€™s ensure that all items are allocated. We notice that items 0 and 4 are not assigned yet.

Reassign items to balance the distribution:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 47
   - Item 3: Value 76
   - Total value for Agent 0: 123

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1: Value 76
   - Item 4: Value 29
   - Total value for Agent 1: 105

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2: Value 93
   - Item 5: Value 92
   - Item 6: Value 50
   - Item 7: Value 64
   - Total value for Agent 2: 299

This distribution attempts to fairly allocate items based on value while ensuring each agent receives an appropriate number of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
