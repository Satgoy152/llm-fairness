Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  74  57  96   6  37  92  67
1  53  30  42  80  87  81  51  70
2  91  10  63  43  29  86  40  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one and assign them to the agents:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Agent 2 values it at 91
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value)

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 63
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 43
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 87
   - Agent 2 values it at 29
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 81
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value)

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 51
   - Agent 2 values it at 40
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 61
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

Now, let's format the allocations in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
