Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  30  77  79  47  36  23   6
1  21  33  96  43  31  95  10  51
2  33  78  91  52  80  78   6  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 78 91 52 80 78  6 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider strategies such as maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, or similar. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [82, 30, 77, 79, 47, 36, 23, 6]
Agent 1: [21, 33, 96, 43, 31, 95, 10, 51]
Agent 2: [33, 78, 91, 52, 80, 78, 6, 12]
```

A potential approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the perceived values for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. We can start by allocating the highest-valued items to the agents who value them most, ensuring each agent receives some items.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 (82) the most.
- Agent 1 values item 2 (96) the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 (80) the most.

Let's continue allocating based on value until all items are assigned:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's consider the next highest values:

- For Agent 0: item 3 (79)
- For Agent 1: item 5 (95)
- For Agent 2: item 1 (78)

Continue with:

4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have two items left (6 and 7), and they need to be distributed:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

The remaining items are:

- Item 6, valued highest by Agent 1 (10), but not very significant.
- Item 7, valued highest by Agent 1 (51).

Assign the remaining items:

7. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

This ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
