Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  17  75  32  76  57  50  10
1  91  84  11  46  14  45  38   9
2  63  21  11  44  51  68  25  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one potential approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. We will distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [62, 17, 75, 32, 76, 57, 50, 10]
- Agent 1: [91, 84, 11, 46, 14, 45, 38, 9]
- Agent 2: [63, 21, 11, 44, 51, 68, 25, 12]

By examining the values, we can allocate the items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it the most (91).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it the most (84).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because they value it the most (75).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because they value it the most (44).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because they value it the most (76).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 because they value it the most (68).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 because they value it the most (50).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 because they value it the most (12).

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
