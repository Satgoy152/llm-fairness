Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  10  96  26  21  64  64  12
1  83   2  65  48  79  60  55  34
2  45  51  22  12  85  16   7  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple way to approach this is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than their fair share.

Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Sort the Items by Value for Each Agent**:
   - For each agent, list the items in descending order of their valuations.

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - Start with the item with the highest valuation available for any agent and allocate it to the corresponding agent.
   - Continue the process, ensuring that each agent gets at least two items since there are three agents and eight items.

3. **Ensure Fair Allocation**:
   - If any agent ends up with more items than others, reallocate to make sure no agent receives more than necessary.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values highest: [2, 0, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Values highest: [0, 4, 2, 5]
- **Agent 2**: Values highest: [4, 7, 1, 0]

Allocate based on highest unique values first, then fill in:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value 96).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value 85).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value 83).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (second highest value 56).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value 64).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest value 64).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value 51).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value 48).

Now each agent gets a fair share of items:

- Agent 0: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 7, 1]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7, 1]
}
```
