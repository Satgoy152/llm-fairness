Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  52  15  52  13   2  75  54
1  38   8  15  32  97  86  22  92
2  15  41  13  93   1  99  32  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a few approaches such as maximizing each agent's satisfaction or ensuring that each agent gets a relatively equal share of their total possible value. However, since there are only 8 items and 3 agents, a simple allocation can be attempted to ensure fairness by considering the highest value for each item.

Let's analyze the values for each item and allocate them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a similar number of items, if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 38, and Agent 2 at 15. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 8, and Agent 2 at 41. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 15, and Agent 2 at 13. Allocate to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 already has the highest overall valuation).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 32, and Agent 2 at 93. Allocate to Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 at 97, and Agent 2 at 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 86, and Agent 2 at 99. Allocate to Agent 2.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 22, and Agent 2 at 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 92, and Agent 2 at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, the agents have the following items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
