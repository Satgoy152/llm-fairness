Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  16  41  31  28  53  84  54
1  44  35  10  60   8  91  47  68
2  15  65  97  15  30  22  21  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. Let's aim to maximize each agent's total valuation by distributing the items in a way that tries to balance the overall value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value item for each agent** and allocate it to that agent if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. **Repeat the process** until all items are allocated.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Initial Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 6 (value 84)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 5 (value 91)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 97)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

### Remaining Items:

After allocating the highest valued items for each agent, we have the following remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

### Continue Allocation:

4. **Agent 0:**
   - Second highest value among unallocated items: Item 7 (value 54)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1:**
   - Second highest value among unallocated items: Item 3 (value 60)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2:**
   - Second highest value among unallocated items: Item 1 (value 65)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

Now, we have the following items left: 0, 4.

7. **Agent 0:**
   - Next highest value among unallocated items: Item 0 (value 46)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 1:**
   - Next highest value among unallocated items: Item 4 (value 8)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 0],
    "1": [5, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
