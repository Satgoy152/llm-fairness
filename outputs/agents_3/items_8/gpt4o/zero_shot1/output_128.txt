Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  10  91  58  60  38  18  36
1  77  39  39  68  37  39  43  20
2  38  21  12   3  65  44  74  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations. Here, we'll assign items such that each agent gets a fair share of value, considering the constraints of integer allocations and the total number of items.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 has relatively balanced valuations but can be prioritized for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 7, and decent valuations for items 6 and 5.

We'll aim to distribute the items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (high valuation of 96).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (high valuation of 91).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuation of 68).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valuation of 39).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (valuation of 37).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (valuation of 44).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (valuation of 74).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (high valuation of 99).

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
