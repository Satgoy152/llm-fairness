Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  43  73   9  42  56  94  54
1  59  65  77  80  73   5  17  68
2  92  32  30  31  73   2  89  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Assign items to agents starting with those who value them the most while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Here are the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 50 + 43 + 73 + 9 + 42 + 56 + 94 + 54 = 421
- Agent 1: 59 + 65 + 77 + 80 + 73 + 5 + 17 + 68 = 444
- Agent 2: 92 + 32 + 30 + 31 + 73 + 2 + 89 + 36 = 385

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (92), so it goes to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (65), so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (77), so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (80), so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agents 1 and 2 both value it equally (73), but since Agent 1 already has 3 items, letâ€™s allocate it to Agent 2 for balance.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (56), so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (94), so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (68), so it goes to Agent 1.

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 7],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while trying to respect their individual valuations.
