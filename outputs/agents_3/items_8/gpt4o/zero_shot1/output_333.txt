Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  38  65  98  12  13  23  53
1  81  66  50  11  19  71  41  26
2   8  91  57  96  26  98  95  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common method for such problems is using an algorithm that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items.

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they got all items:
   - Agent 0: 86 + 38 + 65 + 98 + 12 + 13 + 23 + 53 = 388
   - Agent 1: 81 + 66 + 50 + 11 + 19 + 71 + 41 + 26 = 365
   - Agent 2: 8 + 91 + 57 + 96 + 26 + 98 + 95 + 87 = 458

2. Distribute the items to maximize satisfaction:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 3 highly (98) and item 0 (86).
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 5 (71) and item 1 (66).
- Agent 2 values item 5 (98), item 3 (96), item 6 (95), and item 1 (91) highly.

To balance, we need to allocate in such a way that no agent feels they have been unfairly treated while ensuring that each agent receives some items.

Let's allocate items to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Assign items they value highly but aren't most valued by others, e.g., [0, 2].
- Agent 1: Assign items they value highly but aren't most valued by others, e.g., [4, 7].
- Agent 2: Assign items they value highly, e.g., [1, 3, 5, 6].

Now, let's check:

- Agent 0 receives item 0 (86) and 2 (65), total value = 86 + 65 = 151.
- Agent 1 receives item 4 (19) and 7 (26), total value = 19 + 26 = 45.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 (91), 3 (96), 5 (98), 6 (95), total value = 91 + 96 + 98 + 95 = 380.

This allocation may not be perfectly balanced by value but attempts to give a fair share of items based on their high valuations. Adjustments can be made depending on finer balancing needs, but this offers a reasonable initial allocation.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
