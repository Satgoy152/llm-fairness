Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  82  73  94  25  76  38  70
1  70  33  81  33  51  11  46  20
2  66  33  12  70  58   5  12  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [66 33 12 70 58  5 12 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least some items and all items are allocated. We will try to balance the allocation so that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (94).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (81).
   - Agent 2 values item 7 the most (83).

2. **Allocate these highest value items to each agent initially:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 2.
   - Agent 2 gets item 7.

3. **Allocate remaining items by comparing the second highest values:**
   - Agent 0: Remaining high values are for items 1 (82) and 5 (76).
   - Agent 1: Remaining high values are for items 0 (70) and 4 (51).
   - Agent 2: Remaining high values are for items 0 (66) and 4 (58).

4. **Allocate remaining items by checking overlapping preferences:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 82).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 76).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 70).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 58).

5. **Allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are distributed:**
   - Remaining items are 6.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value 46).

After these allocations, let's present them in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair portion of items based on their valuations, and all items are distributed among the agents.
