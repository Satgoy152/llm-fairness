Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  45  46  51  95  88  48   5
1   0  97  30  83   7  55  55  30
2  91  66  31  19  13  10  14  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we need to consider the value each agent places on each item. Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each item and allocate accordingly, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51.
   - Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Agent 2 values it at 91.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 45.
   - Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Agent 2 values it at 66.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Agent 2 values it at 31.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51.
   - Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - Agent 2 values it at 19.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 95.
   - Agent 1 values it at 7.
   - Agent 2 values it at 13.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - Agent 2 values it at 10.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 48.
   - Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - Agent 2 values it at 14.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Agent 2 values it at 61.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

After going through the items, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 8 items allocated based on the highest valuations.
