Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  11  80  74  58  96  32  51
1  92  37  25  30  63  15  53  43
2  89  98  35  47  60  79  59  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get about 2-3 items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Assign the highest value item to each agent first, ensuring each gets at least one item.
2. After each agent has one item, assign the remaining items by comparing the potential increase in total valuation for each agent if they receive an additional item.
3. Repeat this process until all items are allocated.

Let's start by assigning the highest value item to each agent:

- Agent 0: The highest value item is item 5 (valuation 96).
- Agent 1: The highest value item is item 0 (valuation 92).
- Agent 2: The highest value item is item 1 (valuation 98).

Next, assign the remaining items to maximize total valuation for each agent while keeping the distribution fair:

- Agent 0 has item 5. Next highest for Agent 0 is item 2 (valuation 80).
- Agent 1 has item 0. Next highest for Agent 1 is item 4 (valuation 63).
- Agent 2 has item 1. Next highest for Agent 2 is item 7 (valuation 90).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more, considering the total valuation gain and fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Next highest unallocated item is item 3 (valuation 74).
- Agent 1: Next highest unallocated item is item 6 (valuation 53).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned 2-3 items, maximizing their total valuation and keeping the distribution as fair as possible.
