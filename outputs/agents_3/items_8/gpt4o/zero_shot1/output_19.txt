Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  56  38  40  43  16  94  64
1  97  44  51  93   0  77  24   2
2  67   6  99  60  15  59  97  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly:

**Agent 0:**
- Total valuation is highest for item 6 (94), followed by item 1 (56).

**Agent 1:**
- Total valuation is highest for item 0 (97), followed by item 3 (93).

**Agent 2:**
- Total valuation is highest for item 2 (99), followed by item 6 (97).

Let's try to allocate items in a way that maximizes happiness for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 6).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 0).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 2).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation for item 3).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for item 1).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for item 5).
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for item 4).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for item 7).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
