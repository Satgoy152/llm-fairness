Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  71  36  49  68  11  73  57
1  61  93  36  29  99   6  48   6
2  81  19  59  23  34  69  34  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 71 36 49 68 11 73 57]
 [61 93 36 29 99  6 48  6]
 [81 19 59 23 34 69 34 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve that:

1. **Agent 0** has highest valuations for items: 
   - Item 6 (73)
   - Item 1 (71)
   - Item 7 (57)

2. **Agent 1** has highest valuations for items:
   - Item 4 (99)
   - Item 1 (93), but it's already taken by Agent 0, so we consider next highest.
   - Item 0 (61)

3. **Agent 2** has highest valuations for items:
   - Item 0 (81), but it's already taken by Agent 1, so we consider next highest.
   - Item 5 (69)
   - Item 2 (59)

4. Allocate remaining items based on availability and highest valuations:
   - Agent 0 can take Item 3 (49) given their next highest after allocated items.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 5, 7

Finally, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
