Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  59  72  60  69  33  94  73
1   5  56  49  51  52  76   2  46
2  23  97  67  15  25  24  34  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (72) and 6 (94). We will allocate these items to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 (76) highly, so we will allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 (97) highly, so we will allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Next, we need to distribute the remaining items: 0, 3, 4, and 7.

Let's consider the remaining items and their value distribution:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (45), Agent 1 (5), Agent 2 (23)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (60), Agent 1 (51), Agent 2 (15)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (69), Agent 1 (52), Agent 2 (25)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (73), Agent 1 (46), Agent 2 (41)

5. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 since they value it the most.
6. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 since they value it the most.
7. Allocate item 4 to agent 0 since they value it the most.
8. Allocate item 7 to agent 0 since they value it the most.

By following this approach, agent 0 gets the most value possible from the remaining items.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1]
}
```
