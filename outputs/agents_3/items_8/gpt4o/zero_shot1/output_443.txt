Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  88  79  12  65  54  37  19
1  71  31   9  68  75  60  38  93
2  23  70  33  58  96  42  42  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's analyze the allocations step-by-step, taking into account the values each agent assigns to the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 1 (88), 2 (79), 0 (17).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 7 (93), 4 (75), 0 (71).
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 4 (96), 1 (70), 7 (64).

2. **Allocate the Most Valued Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 1. Next highest is item 2 (79).
   - Agent 1: Already has item 7. Next highest is item 0 (71).
   - Agent 2: Already has item 4. Next highest is item 1, but it's taken. Next, item 7, but it's taken. Assign item 2 (33).

4. **Continue until all items are allocated:**
   - Agent 0: Already has items 1 and 2. Assign item 0 (17).
   - Agent 1: Already has items 7 and 0. Assign item 3 (68).
   - Agent 2: Already has items 4 and 2. Assign items 5 (42) and 6 (42).

Finally, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [7, 0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This distribution respects the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
