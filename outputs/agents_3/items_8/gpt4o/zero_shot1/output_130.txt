Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  23  18  20  17  69  30  56
1  76  90  47  76  41  40  38  57
2  67   2  21  45  82  80   1  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least some allocation of items. To do this, we can consider a simple approach by examining the highest valuations for each agent and then allocating items accordingly, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (64) and 5 (69).
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (90) and 3 (76).
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 (82) and 5 (80).

To ensure a fair allocation while maximizing total valuation, let's allocate items based on maximizing their individual valuations for each agent:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (80 is higher than 69 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a high valuation for it).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (56 is relatively high for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (47 is higher than other agents' valuations).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (38 is higher than other agents' valuations).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least two items, and the total valuation is maximized across all agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
