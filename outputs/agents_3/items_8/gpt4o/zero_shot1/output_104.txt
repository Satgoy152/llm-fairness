Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  70  36  72  87  49  70  31
1  59  63  83  48  25  41  62  13
2  69  85  12   0  51  76  73  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, a balanced distribution would mean each agent should try to get at least 2-3 items depending on their valuation.

Let's start by evaluating which items each agent values the most and try to allocate based on maximizing individual agent happiness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (87), Item 3 (72), Item 1 (70), Item 6 (70)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (83), Item 0 (59), Item 1 (63)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (97), Item 1 (85), Item 5 (76), Item 6 (73)

Based on these valuations and to ensure a fair distribution, the allocation could be as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Give Items 3 (72) and 4 (87) to Agent 0. They have the highest valuation for these items.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Give Items 2 (83) and 0 (59) to Agent 1. They have the highest valuation for these items among their preferences.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Give Items 7 (97), 5 (76), 1 (85), and 6 (73) to Agent 2. They have high valuations for these items compared to the other agents, and this utilizes all remaining items.

After this allocation, all 8 items are distributed among the agents as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [7, 5, 1, 6]
}
```
