Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  89   6  48   1  82  38  99
1  52  95  73  27  98  34  68  60
2  27  70  39   5  11  45  19  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to employ an allocation strategy that considers the highest value each agent assigns to the items, such as a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. List all items and their values for each agent:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (75), Agent 1 (52), Agent 2 (27)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (89), Agent 1 (95), Agent 2 (70)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (6), Agent 1 (73), Agent 2 (39)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (48), Agent 1 (27), Agent 2 (5)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (1), Agent 1 (98), Agent 2 (11)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (82), Agent 1 (34), Agent 2 (45)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (38), Agent 1 (68), Agent 2 (19)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (99), Agent 1 (60), Agent 2 (87)

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 1
   - Item 2: Agent 1
   - Item 3: Agent 0
   - Item 4: Agent 1
   - Item 5: Agent 0
   - Item 6: Agent 1
   - Item 7: Agent 0

3. Review the allocations:
   - Agent 0 has 4 items: [0, 3, 5, 7]
   - Agent 1 has 4 items: [1, 2, 4, 6]
   - Agent 2 has 0 items

4. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives a reasonable number of items. In this case, Agent 2 receives no items, which is suboptimal. We will need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness:

   Let's reallocate to give Agent 2 some items, while still considering the high valuations:
   - Agent 0: [0, 7]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]
   - Agent 2: [2, 3, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures all agents receive items. Now, letâ€™s present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```
