Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  29  22   1  87  80  29  76
1  93  97  32  29  47  56  16  94
2  69  53  32  41  93   4  23  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items. Given that we have 3 agents and 8 items, a natural distribution could be assigning 3 items to two agents and 2 items to the other agent. 

Let's start by considering the highest value items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (87), Item 0 (83), Item 5 (80)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (97), Item 7 (94), Item 0 (93)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (93), Item 7 (80), Item 0 (69)

We'll attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation by distributing these items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 4 (87), Item 0 (83), and Item 6 (29)
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 1 (97), Item 7 (94), and Item 3 (29)
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 5 (4) and Item 2 (32)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
