Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  26   9  29  49  64   4   8
1  91  86  71  89  40  79  83  47
2  12  90  26  50  80  77  88  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 86 71 89 40 79 83 47]
 [12 90 26 50 80 77 88 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least some items and that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Valuations**: First, observe the given valuations for each agent:

   - Agent 0: [23, 26, 9, 29, 49, 64, 4, 8]
   - Agent 1: [91, 86, 71, 89, 40, 79, 83, 47]
   - Agent 2: [12, 90, 26, 50, 80, 77, 88, 39]

2. **Determine Allocation Strategy**: We want to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized, while distributing items fairly. Each agent should receive at least one item, as there are three agents and eight items.

3. **Initial High-Value Allocations**: Assign some of the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring they get their top preferences:

   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 64)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 91)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (value 80)

4. **Complete the Allocation**: Continue allocating the remaining items, considering the next best preferences and ensuring each agent ends up with approximately the same number of items:

   - Agent 0: Items 1, 3 (values 26, 29)
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 6 (values 71, 83)
   - Agent 2: Items 7 (value 39)

5. **Verify the Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item. The allocation should look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations where possible, given the constraints.
