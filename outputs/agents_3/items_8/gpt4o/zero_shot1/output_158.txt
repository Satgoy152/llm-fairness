Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  81  41  55  50  24  20  74
1  30  86  43  37  94  38  46   1
2  87  46  49  97  38  25  25  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 81 41 55 50 24 20 74]
 [30 86 43 37 94 38 46  1]
 [87 46 49 97 38 25 25 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. We need to balance the allocations so that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0: High valuations for items 1, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1: High valuations for items 1, 4, and 6.
- Agent 2: High valuations for items 0, 3, and 7.

Based on this analysis, here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it.
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
5. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it.
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives items they value highly while spreading the items fairly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
