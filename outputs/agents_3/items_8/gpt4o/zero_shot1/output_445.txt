Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  93  33  47  76  96  46  21
1  61  61  25  52  92  23  43  33
2  14  95  31  32  15  27  41  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as high as possible. 

Let's analyze and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 5 (96), Item 1 (93), Item 4 (76).
   - Let's allocate Item 5 and Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 4 (92), Item 3 (52).
   - Let's allocate Item 4 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 7 (85).
   - Since Item 1 is already given to Agent 0, let's allocate Item 7 to Agent 2.
   - Let's also consider other available high-value items for Agent 2, like Item 2 (31) and Item 6 (41).
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 6 to Agent 2.

Finally, let's verify the allocations and ensure all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items 5 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 3
- Agent 2: Items 7, 2, and 6

Total items distributed: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 items. We still have one item left to allocate.

- The remaining item is Item 0. Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for it (70).

Now, all 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 1, and 0
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 3
- Agent 2: Items 7, 2, and 6

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 2, 6]
}
```
