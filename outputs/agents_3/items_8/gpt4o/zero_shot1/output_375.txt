Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  32  96   5  20  90  75  11
1  82  60  37  98  83  18  12  82
2  54  83  60  94  10  90   6  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total value. One common approach is to assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most but ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair number of items, given there are 3 agents and 8 items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. First, determine which items are most highly valued by each agent.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring a balanced distribution.

Let's go through this process:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 2 (96), 5 (90), and 0 (68).
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 3 (98), 0 (82), and 4 (83).
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items 3 (94), 1 (83), and 7 (92).

Now, let's assign the items:

1. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
2. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
3. Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 2, so assign it to Agent 2.
4. Item 5 is valued highly by both Agent 0 and Agent 2, but since Agent 0 already has one item, assign it to Agent 2.
5. Item 1 is valued highly by Agent 2, assign it to Agent 2.
6. Item 0 is next highly valued by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
7. Item 4 is valued by Agent 1, assign it to Agent 1.
8. Finally, item 6 can be assigned to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has only one item so far.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 0, 4],
    "2": [7, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, considering their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.
