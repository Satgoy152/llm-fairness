Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  48  39  36   7  38  92  75
1  35  83  57  33  76   6   8  36
2   5  23  69   4  28  97  39  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use the "highest bidder" method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 48
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 23
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 69
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 36
   - Agent 1 values it at 33
   - Agent 2 values it at 4
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - Allocate to Agent 0

8. Item 7:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Based on this allocation strategy, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
