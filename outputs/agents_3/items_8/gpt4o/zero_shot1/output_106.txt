Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  11  73  81  10  40  87  27
1  72  85  17  82  29  31  90  11
2  64  30  75  85  16  28  36  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 85 17 82 29 31 90 11]
 [64 30 75 85 16 28 36 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while also ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them. Here's a possible allocation:

1. First, list all the items with their values for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, ensuring each item is allocated only once.
3. Make sure each agent has a roughly equal number of items, accounting for the total of 8 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [9, 11, 73, 81, 10, 40, 87, 27]
- Agent 1 values: [72, 85, 17, 82, 29, 31, 90, 11]
- Agent 2 values: [64, 30, 75, 85, 16, 28, 36, 93]

Now, allocate the items:

1. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1 (90), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 2 (93), so allocate to Agent 2.
3. Item 3 is valued equally by Agents 0 and 2 (85), but Agent 0 has fewer high-value items, so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 (75), so allocate to Agent 2.
5. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 (85), so allocate to Agent 1.
6. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (29), so allocate to Agent 1.
7. Item 5 is valued higher by Agent 0 (40), so allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 0 is valued higher by Agent 1 (72), so allocate to Agent 1.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```
