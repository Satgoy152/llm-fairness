Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  61  50   1  96  72  58  75
1  94  66  39  58  60   3   2  45
2  31  92  71  12  25  97  49  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 66 39 58 60  3  2 45]
 [31 92 71 12 25 97 49 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations to make a balanced allocation:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0 (78), 1 (61), 4 (96), 5 (72), and 7 (75).
- **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 0 (94), 3 (58), and 4 (60).
- **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 1 (92), 2 (71), 5 (97).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, and 7.
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 5, and 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable number of items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
