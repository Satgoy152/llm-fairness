Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  20  15  77  70   9  59   9
1  99  96  84  62  60  29  52  16
2  42  48  42  51   5  88  90  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values: 3, 20, 15, 77, 70, 9, 59, 9
   - Agent 1 values: 99, 96, 84, 62, 60, 29, 52, 16
   - Agent 2 values: 42, 48, 42, 51, 5, 88, 90, 20

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (99) and item 1 (96).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 5 (88) and 6 (90).
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (77) and item 4 (70).

3. **Fair Distribution:**
   - Ensure each agent gets an equitable share by distributing the remaining items in a way that maximizes their individual values and ensures all items are allocated.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: items 3, 4
   - Agent 1: items 0, 1, 2
   - Agent 2: items 5, 6, 7

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
