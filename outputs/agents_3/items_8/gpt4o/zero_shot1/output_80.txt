Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  53  13  85  18  33   3  15
1  49  63  37  25  68  30  23  76
2  66  67  56  88  77  72  75  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total utility. One common approach is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (85), Item 1 (53)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (76), Item 4 (68)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (88), Item 6 (75), Item 5 (72), Item 4 (77)

We can start by allocating items to each agent based on their valuations, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll try to distribute items so that valuations are maximized and each agent has a fair share.

Letâ€™s allocate step-by-step:

- **Agent 2** has the highest value for Item 3 (88), so it gets Item 3.
- **Agent 0** has the next highest value for Item 3 (85), which is already taken. Thus, Agent 0 gets its next highest, Item 1 (53).
- **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for Item 4 (77), so it gets Item 4.
- **Agent 1** has the highest value for Item 7 (76), so it gets Item 7.
- **Agent 2** has the next highest value for Item 6 (75), so it gets Item 6.
- **Agent 2** gets Item 5 (72) as it still holds the highest value.
- **Agent 1** has the next highest value for Item 4 (but it's taken by Agent 2), so it gets Item 0 (49).
- **Agent 0** gets Item 2 (13), which is the last remaining item.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute items based on the highest valuations each agent has, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
