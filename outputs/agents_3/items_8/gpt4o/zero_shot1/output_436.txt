Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  49   0  92  96  64   2  65
1  23  59  60  42  60  40  77   8
2  60  91  31  25  22  87   3  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that balances the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We can use a greedy approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most until all items are distributed.

Here's how the allocation proceeds:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 23
   - Agent 2 values it at 60
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 91
   - Allocate to Agent 2

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 25
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - Allocate to Agent 0

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 87
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 2
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 3
   - Allocate to Agent 1

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 51
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
