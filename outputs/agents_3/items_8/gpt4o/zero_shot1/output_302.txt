Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  92   9  15  42  72  49  32
1  34  66  43   6  55  38  96  41
2  20  38  16  56  67  89  66  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by giving each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation. This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their initial satisfaction.

2. **Remaining Items Allocation:**
   - After each agent has one item, distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations across all agents.

3. **Fair Allocation Strategy:**
   - We will look to balance the total value each agent receives, ensuring no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- **Agent 0:** Highest value is 92 for item 1.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is 96 for item 6.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is 89 for item 5.

### Step 2: Remaining Items Allocation
Now, allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

- Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7

- Check the highest remaining values:
  - Agent 0 values item 5 at 72 (already taken).
  - Agent 1 values item 7 at 41.
  - Agent 2 values item 7 at 85.

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4

- Check the highest remaining values:
  - Agent 0 values item 4 at 42.
  - Agent 1 values item 4 at 55.
  - Agent 2 values item 4 at 67.

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Remaining items: 0, 2, 3

- Check the highest remaining values:
  - Agent 0 values item 0 at 24.
  - Agent 1 values item 0 at 34.
  - Agent 2 values item 0 at 20.

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Remaining items: 2, 3

- Check the highest remaining values:
  - Agent 0 values item 3 at 15.
  - Agent 1 values item 3 at 6.
  - Agent 2 values item 3 at 56.

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- Remaining item: 2

- Check the highest remaining values:
  - Agent 0 values item 2 at 9.
  - Agent 1 values item 2 at 43.
  - Agent 2 values item 2 at 16.

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation
Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6, 0, 2],
    "2": [5, 7, 4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the distribution is fairly balanced based on their valuations.
