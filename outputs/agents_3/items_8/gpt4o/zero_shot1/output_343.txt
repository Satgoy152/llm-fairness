Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  38  49  20  81  60  39  91
1  45  76  38  44  61  40  86  45
2  69  33  67   1  23  54  20  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 38 49 20 81 60 39 91]
 [45 76 38 44 61 40 86 45]
 [69 33 67  1 23 54 20 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. We must ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [87, 38, 49, 20, 81, 60, 39, 91]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [45, 76, 38, 44, 61, 40, 86, 45]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [69, 33, 67, 1, 23, 54, 20, 68]

A potential strategy is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. Since we have 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should receive approximately 2 or 3 items.

**Allocation:**

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 7.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 6.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 2 and 5.

For the remaining items (3 and 4), we can assign them to the agents who have received fewer items or for whom these items have relatively high values:

- Item 3: Assign to agent 0 (value: 20) or agent 1 (value: 44). Agent 1 values it higher.
- Item 4: Assign to agent 0 (value: 81).

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least two items, and the items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
