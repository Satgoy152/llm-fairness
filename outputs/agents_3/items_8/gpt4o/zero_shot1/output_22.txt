Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  42  52  98   8  12  98  15
1  64  86   5  76  88  36  91   6
2  62  97  89  14  99   8   6  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 42 52 98  8 12 98 15]
 [64 86  5 76 88 36 91  6]
 [62 97 89 14 99  8  6 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 6 (98 each). Therefore, we can allocate these two items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 6 (86, 88, and 91, respectively). Since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 4. Since item 1 and 4 are already allocated, we can allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.

To complete the allocation, we need to account for the remaining items. Items 0 and 7 are left:

4. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 2.

5. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
