Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  10  65  18  54  59  11  18
1  22  50  59  32  84  93  74  20
2  85   6  29  14  30  54  76  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's consider the strategy of assigning items to the agent who values them the most:

1. Examine the values each agent has for each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Using this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (10).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (65).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (18).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (84).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (93).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (76).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (33).

Now, we ensure that each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4, 5
- Agent 2: Item 0, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives the items they value most.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 7]
}
```
