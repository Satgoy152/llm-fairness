Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   0  89  47  83   2  98  20
1  88  57  94  21  43  41  56   1
2  97   5  85  45  19  50  95  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's look at a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 98), item 2 to agent 1 (value 94), and item 0 to agent 2 (value 97). These are the highest valuations for each agent.
2. Next, assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 83) as the next highest value for agent 0.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 50) as it is a significant valuation for agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 21) as it gives a fair distribution.
5. Finally, assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 57) and item 7 to agent 0 (value 20), as these provide better allocations.

After these allocations, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Gets items 6, 4, and 7.
- Agent 1: Gets items 2, 3, and 1.
- Agent 2: Gets items 0 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items while maximizing their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 1],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
