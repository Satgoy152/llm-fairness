Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  16  46  72  35  39  80  96
1  95  99  21  14  60  38  99  67
2  66  79  49   8  43  55  81  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 16 46 72 35 39 80 96]
 [95 99 21 14 60 38 99 67]
 [66 79 49  8 43 55 81 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, considering that each agent should receive at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign initial high-value items to each agent:**

   - Agent 0: Item 7 (value 96)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 99)
   - Agent 2: Item 6 (value 81)

2. **Distribute remaining items based on the highest remaining values for each agent:**

   - Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 95) 
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 55)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 35)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 72)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 49)

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
