Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  96  61  88  56  73  83  10
1  78  45   4  40  17  75  28  71
2  31  73   4  46  93  65  82  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for a balanced distribution. We'll try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's start by examining the highest value each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

1. **Agent 0's highest preferences:**
   - Item 1 with value 96
   - Item 3 with value 88
   - Item 6 with value 83

2. **Agent 1's highest preferences:**
   - Item 0 with value 78
   - Item 5 with value 75
   - Item 7 with value 71

3. **Agent 2's highest preferences:**
   - Item 4 with value 93
   - Item 6 with value 82
   - Item 1 with value 73

Now, let's make decisions based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Highest preferences are items 1, 3, and 6.
  - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0 for high satisfaction.

- **Agent 1:** Highest preferences are items 0, 5, and 7.
  - Allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:** Highest preferences are items 4, 6, and 1.
  - Allocate items 4 and 6 to Agent 2.

So far, the distribution is:
- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]

We have allocated 6 items. Let's allocate the remaining two items (2 and 5) to balance the distribution:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest available valuation).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest available valuation).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 7, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 7, 5],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
