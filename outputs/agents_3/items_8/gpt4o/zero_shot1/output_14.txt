Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95   3  20   1  32  88  40  13
1  63  12  84  30  52  26  79  89
2  12  94  36  84  98   0  44  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 12 84 30 52 26 79 89]
 [12 94 36 84 98  0 44 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's walk through a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prioritize items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Item 0: Value 95
   - Item 5: Value 88
   - Item 6: Value 40
   - Total value: 95 + 88 + 40 = 223

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Prioritize items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Item 2: Value 84
   - Item 4: Value 52
   - Item 7: Value 89
   - Total value: 84 + 52 + 89 = 225

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Prioritize items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Item 1: Value 94
   - Item 3: Value 84
   - Total value: 94 + 84 = 178

Now, let's check that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 5, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 4, 7]
- Agent 2 receives items: [1, 3]

All 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
