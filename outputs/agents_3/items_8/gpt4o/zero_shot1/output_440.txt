Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  28  90  70  12  27  24  93
1  49  34   3  86  51  88   8  33
2  12  96  46  77  71  59  85   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the sum of the values for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. 

One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum allocation" where we assign items to agents such that the overall sum of values is maximized. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by pairing each item with the agent that values it most.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 1, 4, and 6.

After examining the values, we can allocate the items as follows to maximize the sum of values for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 6

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives.
