Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  43  68  23  50  38  75  26
1  45  88  32  97  78  58  50  34
2  15  80  80  53  78  89   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 43 68 23 50 38 75 26]
 [45 88 32 97 78 58 50 34]
 [15 80 80 53 78 89  0 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the following strategy: assign items to agents such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring each agent gets a similar number of items. Given there are 8 items and 3 agents, one fair division could be for two agents to receive 3 items each and one agent to receive 2 items.

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (87), Item 6 (75), Item 2 (68)
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 1 (88), Item 4 (78)
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (89), Item 7 (91), Item 1 (80)

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0, 6, 2 (based on their highest preferences).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 3, 1, 4 (based on their highest preferences).
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 5, 7 (based on their highest preferences).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least two of their most valued items and the total number of items allocated is 8.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 2],
    "1": [3, 1, 4],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```
