Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  66  15  74  37   3  42  63
1  85  87  71  54   4  76  92  65
2  16  55  51  71  18  72  33  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for all agents. This can be approached as an optimization problem, where we aim to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6.
   - Agent 2 has relatively high valuations for items 3, 5, and 7.

2. **Allocate based on the highest value per agent**:
   - Assign items with the highest value for each agent, while ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

3. **Consider fairness**:
   - Each agent should receive at least one item, and the total number of items allocated should be 8.

**Allocation Plan**:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

- Next, assign remaining items based on the descending order of value preferences while ensuring fairness:
  - Agent 1 values item 0 highly, assign item 0 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 0 values item 1 highly, assign item 1 to Agent 0.
  - Agent 2 values item 5 highly, assign item 5 to Agent 2.
  - Agent 2 values item 2 more than others, assign item 2 to Agent 2.
  - Agent 1 values item 4 more than others, assign item 4 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with a reasonable distribution based on their valuations.
