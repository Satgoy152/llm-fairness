Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  53  76  73  91  54  14  54
1  31  46  75  78  34  95  64  41
2  24  77  96  98  11  17  72   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we could consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify which items hold the highest value for each agent and try to allocate them accordingly, balancing the overall distribution of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Highest: 91 (Item 4), 76 (Item 2), 73 (Item 3)

Agent 1:
- Highest: 95 (Item 5), 78 (Item 3), 75 (Item 2)

Agent 2:
- Highest: 98 (Item 3), 96 (Item 2), 77 (Item 1)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

At this point, we have allocated three items and need to distribute the remaining five. We will try to distribute items such that each agent ends up with a fair share based on their preferences:

4. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
5. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
6. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
7. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
8. Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

Thus, each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
