Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  99  82  50  20  53   0  73
1  24  44  58  67  11  37   9  36
2  69  52  40  52  40  14  16  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 27     | 99     | 82     | 50     | 20     | 53     | 0      | 73     |
| 1     | 24     | 44     | 58     | 67     | 11     | 37     | 9      | 36     |
| 2     | 69     | 52     | 40     | 52     | 40     | 14     | 16     | 86     |

### Allocation Approach:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 1 highly (99) and Item 2 (82), so they should receive these items.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 3 highly (67) and Item 2 (58) but since Item 2 is more valuable for Agent 0, Agent 1 should get Item 3.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 7 highly (86) and Item 0 (69), so they should receive these items.
4. Distribute remaining items to balance allocations.

### Fair Allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 1, 2
2. Agent 1: Items 3, 5, 6
3. Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 7

These allocations aim to balance the value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring every item is allocated.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
