Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  44  99  42  98  57  48  34
1   2  86  98  36  58  56  84  15
2  19  69  66  62  32   9  54  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. A common approach is to use an algorithm such as the "Max-Min Fairness" or similar, which aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent can receive. However, for simplicity, I'll try to balance the total value assigned to each agent based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 0 (28), 4 (98), 6 (48)
   - Total Value: 174

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1 (86), 2 (98), 7 (15)
   - Total Value: 199

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 3 (62), 5 (9)
   - Total Value: 71

This allocation gives a fair distribution based on their respective valuations and ensures all items are allocated.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.
