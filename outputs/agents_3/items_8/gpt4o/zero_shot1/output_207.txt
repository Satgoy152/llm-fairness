Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  16  15   5  73  22  87  84
1  42  72  96  21  42  47  11  42
2  23  17  27  13  24  70  48  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 72 96 21 42 47 11 42]
 [23 17 27 13 24 70 48 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

First, let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [89, 16, 15, 5, 73, 22, 87, 84]
Agent 1: [42, 72, 96, 21, 42, 47, 11, 42]
Agent 2: [23, 17, 27, 13, 24, 70, 48, 39]
```

Next, let's try to maximize the total value for each agent based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (89), 6 (87), 7 (84), 4 (73)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (96), 1 (72)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 5 (70)

Based on the highest valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 6, and 7
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 1
- Agent 2 gets items 5, 3, and 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5, 3, 4]
}
```
