Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  94  62  52  88  77   9  66
1  46  26  46   9  47  73  97  60
2  45  62  97  94  76  55  43  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 62 97 94 76 55 43 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. This can be approached as an optimization problem where we try to assign items to agents such that the overall satisfaction (total valuation) is maximized.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.

We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on these valuations.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Select items with the highest value for Agent 0, which are items 0 and 1. 

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Select the item with the highest value for Agent 1, which is item 6.
   - Choose item 5 next, which has a relatively high valuation.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Select items with the highest values for Agent 2, which are items 2 and 3.
   - Choose item 4, which has a high valuation for Agent 2.

Finally, we need to distribute item 7. It has a moderate value for Agent 0 and Agent 1 but a lower value for Agent 2. To balance the allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 due to the moderate valuation and to balance the number of items.

Now, we can list the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
