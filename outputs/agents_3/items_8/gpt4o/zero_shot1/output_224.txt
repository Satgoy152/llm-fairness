Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  62  42  77  50  37  13  95
1  62  67  69  14  21  47  51  15
2  39  21   6  81  25  73  70   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one possible fair distribution could be giving 3 items to one agent and 2 items each to the other two agents.

Let's start by evaluating the highest-value items for each agent and distribute the items accordingly.

### Agent 0
- Highest values: Item 7 (95), Item 3 (77), Item 1 (62)

### Agent 1
- Highest values: Item 2 (69), Item 1 (67), Item 0 (62)

### Agent 2
- Highest values: Item 3 (81), Item 5 (73), Item 6 (70)

### Allocation Strategy
1. Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value).
4. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest value).
5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (third highest value).
6. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (third highest value).
7. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1).
8. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (best remaining option).

### Allocations
Based on the strategy above, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [1, 0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations while all 8 items are distributed.
