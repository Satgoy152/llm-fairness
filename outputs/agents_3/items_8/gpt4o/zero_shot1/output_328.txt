Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  77  78  96  31  34  97  91
1  89  11  88  10  65  23  95  64
2  92  59  30   8  87  64  47  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We need to make sure that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents starting with the one who values the item the most.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0's valuations: [77, 77, 78, 96, 31, 34, 97, 91]
- Agent 1's valuations: [89, 11, 88, 10, 65, 23, 95, 64]
- Agent 2's valuations: [92, 59, 30, 8, 87, 64, 47, 44]

We will start by allocating items based on the highest individual valuation each agent gives to an item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation 97).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 88).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation 87).

Now, each agent has at least one item. Let's allocate the remaining items.

4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (valuation 96).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (valuation 89).
6. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (valuation 59).
7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (valuation 91).
8. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (valuation 64).

Now, each agent has received some items, and all 8 items have been allocated. Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
