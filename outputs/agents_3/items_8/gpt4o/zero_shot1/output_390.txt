Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1   8  93  36  84  45  84  80
1  92  11  50  85  98  80  92  69
2  95  46  35  16  29  31  18  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 46 35 16 29 31 18 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's summarize the total valuation for each agent if they were to get all items:

- Agent 0: 1 + 8 + 93 + 36 + 84 + 45 + 84 + 80 = 431
- Agent 1: 92 + 11 + 50 + 85 + 98 + 80 + 92 + 69 = 577
- Agent 2: 95 + 46 + 35 + 16 + 29 + 31 + 18 + 52 = 322

Now, let's attempt an allocation that tries to maximize the valuation for each agent:

1. Assign items to each agent starting with the highest value item for each agent.
2. Ensure that no item is allocated more than once.
3. Make sure that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 4, 3, 0, and 6.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 0, 1, and 7.

Based on the above, we'll allocate the items as follows to maximize each agent's valuation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2 (93), item 6 (84).
- Agent 1: Assign item 4 (98), item 3 (85), item 0 (92).
- Agent 2: Assign item 1 (46), item 5 (31), item 7 (52).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuation.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 3, 0],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives items, and attempts to maximize individual valuations.
