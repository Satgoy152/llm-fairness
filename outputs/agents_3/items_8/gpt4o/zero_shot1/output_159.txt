Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13   1  71  16   7  68  91  20
1  56  39  53   5  93  79  30  28
2  39  86   6  38  89  26  64  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can apply a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. One approach is to assign items to the agent that values each item the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if feasible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual valuations per item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 56, which is the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 86, which is the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 71, which is the highest.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 38, which is the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 79, which is the highest.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 91, which is the highest.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it at 42, which is the highest.

Based on this allocation strategy, each agent receives at least two items:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 7.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
