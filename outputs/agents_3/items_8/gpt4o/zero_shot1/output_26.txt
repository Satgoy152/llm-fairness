Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  87   5  11  33  68   0  80
1  46   5  27  44  85  55  25  86
2  50  91   2  99  45  54  53  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 87  5 11 33 68  0 80]
 [46  5 27 44 85 55 25 86]
 [50 91  2 99 45 54 53 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets a similar total valuation of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [27, 87, 5, 11, 33, 68, 0, 80]
- Agent 1: [46, 5, 27, 44, 85, 55, 25, 86]
- Agent 2: [50, 91, 2, 99, 45, 54, 53, 29]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them (99).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has the second-highest value for them (91).
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (86).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has the second-highest value for them (85).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them (68).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, who values it at 46, which is the highest left value for this item.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, who values it at 53, which is the highest left value for this item.
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, who values it at 5, which is the only option left.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 6]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
