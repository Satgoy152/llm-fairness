Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  19  20  58   8  82  74  37
1  68  63  47  97   5  97  98  51
2  56  40  57  93  85  81  13  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible. One common method to achieve fairness is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a balanced number of items.

For this scenario, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent receives an approximately equal total value. The goal is to allocate 8 items among the 3 agents.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0 (Value = 82), 5 (Value = 82), 7 (Value = 37)
   - Total Value = 82 + 82 + 37 = 201

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3 (Value = 97), 6 (Value = 98)
   - Total Value = 97 + 98 = 195

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 1 (Value = 40), 2 (Value = 57), 4 (Value = 85)
   - Total Value = 40 + 57 + 85 = 182

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent is assigned an integer number of items.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
