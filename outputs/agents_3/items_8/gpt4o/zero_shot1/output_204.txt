Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  14  68  42  94  41  75  94
1   5  81   8  21  14  92  78  78
2   6  99  63  67  17  64  82   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 99 63 67 17 64 82  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraints, we aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (valuation) is optimized. Let's analyze the table and make decisions based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 4 (94), Item 7 (94), Item 6 (75)
   - Let's allocate Items 0, 4, and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (81), Item 5 (92), Item 6 (78), Item 7 (78)
   - Item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0, so let's choose Items 1 and 5 for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 3 (67), Item 6 (82)
   - Item 1 is already allocated to Agent 1, and Item 6 is also highly valued by Agent 1, so let's choose Items 2 and 3 for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes individual agent valuations based on available items. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 3 agents, fairly considering their valuations.
