Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  19  12  73  85  74  99  69
1  60   7  28  51  42  86  89  68
2   5  89  81  95  64  90  24  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 89 81 95 64 90 24 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is one potential approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 (85), 6 (99), and 5 (74).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5 (86), 6 (89), and 0 (60).
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 (95), 1 (89), and 5 (90).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2, given the high valuation of 90, which is the highest for this item.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, the second-highest bid after Agent 0.

3. **Continue Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 for the highest valuation of 95.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 for a valuation of 12, since other high-value preferences have been satisfied.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it provides a significant value of 60 to them.

4. **Balance Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, given its high valuation of 89.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0, for a moderate valuation of 69.

By ensuring that each agent receives items where they have relatively high valuation, we aim to distribute the items fairly.

The final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 7],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [5, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives at least one item,
- The total number of items allocated is exactly 8,
- The allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
