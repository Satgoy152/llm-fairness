Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  21   2  84  22  46  87  31
1  52  37  91  73  72  75  19  42
2  25  74  30  55  59  87  11  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable collection of items that reflects their preferences as best as possible. We will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - High valuations: Item 3 (84), Item 6 (87)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 5 (46), Item 7 (31)
   
2. **Agent 1:**  
   - High valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 5 (75)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 3 (73), Item 4 (72)
   
3. **Agent 2:**  
   - High valuations: Item 1 (74), Item 7 (91)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 4 (59), Item 5 (87)

Based on this, a fair allocation might be:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items 3 and 6 (high valuation items for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 2 and 4 (high valuation items for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** Gets items 1, 5, 7, and 0 (high and moderate valuation items for Agent 2, with item 0 as an additional item since it has low value for all)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 7, 0]
}
```
