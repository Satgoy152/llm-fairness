Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   5  82  14  86  37  34   3
1  99  39  45  35  29  22  27   3
2  53   3  83  84  68  23  98  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 39 45 35 29 22 27  3]
 [53  3 83 84 68 23 98 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. We will ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the situation:

- Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (82), Item 4 (86)
- Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (45), Item 1 (39)
- Agent 2's highest valuations: Item 6 (98), Item 3 (84), Item 2 (83)

A possible fair allocation strategy involves giving each agent some of their most valued items while ensuring that no more than 8 items are allocated in total.

### Allocation Plan:
1. Agent 0: Allocate items based on their highest valuations where possible.
2. Agent 1: Allocate items based on their highest valuations where possible.
3. Agent 2: Allocate items based on their highest valuations where possible.

To implement this, we can start by allocating items with unique high valuations to each agent, and then distribute any remaining items based on secondary preferences.

### Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 4.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1 and Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3, Item 5, Item 6, and Item 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and all 8 items are distributed.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
