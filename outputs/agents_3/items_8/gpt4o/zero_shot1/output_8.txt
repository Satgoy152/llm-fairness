Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  45  14  72  20  92   7  74
1  12   9  10  36  90  11  78  25
2  83  38  61  55  92  37  75  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can employ a greedy strategy where we assign items based on the highest value for each agent sequentially, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and assigning items:

1. **Initialize**: Create a dictionary to hold the allocations for each agent.

2. **Item-by-item allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share of items (since we have 3 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 or 3 items).

3. **Greedy allocation**: We'll go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest value for that item, ensuring fair distribution of items.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values for items 5, 3, and 7. 
- **Agent 1**: Has high values for items 4, 6, and 3.
- **Agent 2**: Has high values for items 0, 5, and 2.

**Allocations**:
- Items 0 and 5 can be allocated to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values these highly.
- Item 1 can be allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 3 can be allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 4 can be allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 6 can be allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 7 can be allocated to Agent 0.

Let's finalize the allocation while ensuring each agent gets at least 2 or 3 items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations. Agent 0 receives items with higher values according to their preferences, and so do Agents 1 and 2.
