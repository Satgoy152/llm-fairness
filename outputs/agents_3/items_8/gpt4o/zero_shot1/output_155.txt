Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  64  77  84  42  61  67  47
1  89   9  61  37  90  39  46  34
2  57   2  57  10  85   3  78   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method like the "maximum marginal return" or "greedy" allocation, which tries to allocate items in a way that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent.

Let's go through the process:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, keeping track of the total number of items assigned to each agent.

2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, which means we need to balance the allocations fairly.

Let's start by examining the table and assigning items based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest at 89.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 64.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest at 77.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 84.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 90.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest at 61.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it highest at 78.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it highest at 47.

Now, let's tally the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 6

Each agent has been allocated an integer number of items, and all 8 items have been allocated.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6]
}
```
