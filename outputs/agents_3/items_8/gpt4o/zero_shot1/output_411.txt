Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  76  27  59   7  43  90  36
1   2  68  63  55  90  94  30   6
2   9  91  65  88  68  81   4  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 76 27 59  7 43 90 36]
 [ 2 68 63 55 90 94 30  6]
 [ 9 91 65 88 68 81  4 25]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring every item is assigned to one agent. Below is a potential allocation strategy:

Agent 0:

Item 6: Value = 90
Item 0: Value = 26
Total Value = 116
Agent 1:

Item 5: Value = 94
Item 4: Value = 90
Total Value = 184
Agent 2:

Item 1: Value = 91
Item 2: Value = 65
Item 3: Value = 88
Item 7: Value = 25
Total Value = 269
Here's the allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
