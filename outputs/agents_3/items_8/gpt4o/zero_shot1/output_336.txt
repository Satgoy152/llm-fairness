Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  14  66  52  37  31   3  66
1  65  84  63  86  84  59  80  58
2  42  11   0  65  12  59  86   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. One way to do this is by considering each agentâ€™s preferences and attempting to balance the total valuation across the agents as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 and 7 highly (66 each).
- **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 3 (86) and 4 (84).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 6 highly (86).

We can attempt the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 2, 7
   - Total valuation: 66 + 66 = 132

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 4
   - Total valuation: 86 + 84 = 170

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 6
   - Total valuation: 86

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 5:

- **Agent 0**: Can take item 0 (43)
- **Agent 2**: Can take items 5 (59) and 1 (11)

Revised allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 2, 7, 0
   - Total valuation: 66 + 66 + 43 = 175

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 4
   - Total valuation: 86 + 84 = 170

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 6, 5, 1
   - Total valuation: 86 + 59 + 11 = 156

This allocation attempts to balance the overall valuation among agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6, 5, 1]
}
```
