Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  53  71  22  81  60  50  53
1  54  50  53  25   3  27  48  75
2  16  97  66  46  69  97  96  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 8 items and 3 agents, one approach is to distribute 2 or 3 items to each agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [68, 53, 71, 22, 81, 60, 50, 53]
- Agent 1: [54, 50, 53, 25, 3, 27, 48, 75]
- Agent 2: [16, 97, 66, 46, 69, 97, 96, 86]

We aim to allocate items where each agent's value is relatively high, ensuring a fair distribution. A reasonable approach is to:

1. Identify each agent's highest valued items.
2. Share items among agents to maximize their overall valuation.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (81), Item 2 (71), Item 0 (68)
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (75), Item 0 (54), Item 2 (53)
   - Allocate: Items 1 and 7

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 5 (97), Item 6 (96)
   - Allocate: Items 2, 3, 5, and 6

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value relatively highly, balancing fairness with maximizing total valuation.
