Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  51  65  83  80  67  68  24
1  74  23   6  33  63  71  38  24
2  60  96  27   0  73  50  65  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This can be approached by considering each agent's preferences for the items.

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 3 (83), 4 (80), and 0 (70).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 0 (74), 5 (71), and 4 (63).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 1 (96), 4 (73), and 5 (50).

2. **Allocate items based on preferences and ensuring fairness:**
   - Start by assigning items to agents based on their top preferences without overlapping. If there are overlaps, prioritize higher bids.
   - Consider fairness by ensuring each agent gets a similar number of items.

3. **Resolve potential conflicts:**
   - If two agents have a high value for the same item, assign it to the agent with the higher value and reassign an alternative item to the other agent.

Using this method, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 5 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 2, 4, and 7.

These allocations give each agent a fair share of items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
