Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  33  86  45  91  48  17   9
1  71  14  89   6  88  61  27  59
2  97  55  57  46  47  23  57  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, one potential approach is to allocate approximately 2-3 items per agent.

Let's examine the valuations and try to make a balanced distribution:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest valuations: Item 4 (91), Item 2 (86), and Item 5 (48).
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 4 (88), and Item 0 (71).
  
- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 7 (64), and Item 1 (55).

Based on the above observations, we can attempt the following allocation:

1. Assign items with the highest valuations to each agent.
2. Distribute remaining items trying to balance the total valuation each agent gets.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 4 and 2 
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 7, 1, 3, and 6

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: [4, 2] (valuation: 91 + 86 = 177)
- Agent 1: [0, 5] (valuation: 71 + 61 = 132)
- Agent 2: [7, 1, 3, 6] (valuation: 64 + 55 + 46 + 57 = 222)

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7, 1, 3, 6]
}
```
