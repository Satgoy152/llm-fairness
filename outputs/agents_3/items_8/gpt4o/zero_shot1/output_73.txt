Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  44  54  89  35  25  49  30
1  36  78  78  25  66   8  71  55
2  46  57  93  22   7  24  99  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 3 (89), Item 0 (76)
   - Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 1 (78), Item 2 (78)
   - Agent 2's highest valuations: Item 6 (99), Item 2 (93)

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Highest remaining valuation is Item 0 (76), allocate Item 0
   - Agent 1: Next highest remaining valuation is Item 2 (78), allocate Item 2
   - Agent 2: Next highest remaining valuation is Item 2 (93), but already allocated to Agent 1. Next is Item 7 (49), allocate Item 7

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Number of Items:**
   - Agent 0: Allocate Item 4 (35) and Item 5 (25) based on remaining high valuations
   - Agent 1: Already has 2 items
   - Agent 2: Allocate Item 5 (24)

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 2: Items 6, 7, 4, 5

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while adhering to the constraint of 8 items being allocated in total.
