Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  87  40  45   1  91  10  45
1  17  47  92  11   4  61  11  34
2  21  66  40  40  17  62   1  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizing the total valuation for each agent, we can proceed as follows:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive for different combinations of items.
2. Aim to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a fair share and maximizes their respective valuations.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 7 and 5.

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 5
   - Valuation: 93 (item 0) + 87 (item 1) + 91 (item 5) = 271

2. **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
   - Valuation: 92 (item 2) + 11 (item 3) = 103

3. **Agent 2**: Items 4, 6, 7
   - Valuation: 17 (item 4) + 1 (item 6) + 90 (item 7) = 108

This allocation gives each agent a set of items such that no items are left unallocated, and each agent's total valuation is reasonable based on their preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
