Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  15  31  17  91  84  94   7
1  18  31  56   9  38  43  88  30
2   3  78   1  32  54  37  22   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 78  1 32 54 37 22  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use a simple allocation strategy. We'll try to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets some items whenever possible.

Let's examine the table and allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest valuations for Agent 0 are for items 6 (94) and 4 (91).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest valuations for Agent 1 are for item 6 (88) and item 2 (56).
   - Since item 6 is already taken by Agent 0, Agent 1 can take item 2.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest valuations for Agent 2 are for item 1 (78) and item 4 (54).
   - Since item 4 is already taken by Agent 0, Agent 2 can take item 1.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Remaining items: 3, 5, 7

We can allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 4 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (next highest valuation for Agent 1 is 43 for item 5).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (next highest valuation for Agent 2 is 32 for item 3) and item 7 (next highest valuation for Agent 2 is 4 for item 7).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 7, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has some items, and all items are allocated.
