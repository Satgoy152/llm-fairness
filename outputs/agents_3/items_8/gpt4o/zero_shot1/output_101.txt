Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  53  71  19  72  56  62   8
1  99  63  14  65  36  76  89  97
2  11  49  85  27  38  36  89  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering each agent's valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List Valuations**: First, list all the valuation scores for each agent for each item.

2. **Assign Items Maximally**: Assign items to agents based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get around 3 items, with one agent receiving only 2 items.

3. **Balancing Fairness and Value**: We must ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible while maximizing the total value for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation considering the above constraints:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items with highest valuations to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items with highest valuations to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items with highest valuations to Agent 2.

### Allocation Plan
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
