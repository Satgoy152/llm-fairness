Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  18  79   1   1  86  34  95
1  11  93  30  79   7  68  65   8
2  19  84  19  92  59   7  43  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least some items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values the next item the most, ensuring an equitable distribution across agents.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

- Start with the highest-valued items and allocate them to the respective agent.
- Continue allocating in a way that balances the overall value received by each agent.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (98), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (93), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (92), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** values item 7 highly (95), so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 0** also values item 5 highly (86), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values item 2 (30), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 2** values item 4 (59), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 1** values item 6 (65), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has a reasonable number of items, and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations while all items are distributed.
