Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  20  34  72  83  68  84   6
1  21   9  81  33  67  60  46  57
2  84   2   9  39  92  93  54  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21  9 81 33 67 60 46 57]
 [84  2  9 39 92 93 54 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one potential allocation approach:

1. Calculate the highest value for each item across all agents and assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item by adjusting allocations if needed.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 84, which is the highest, so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 20, the highest, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 81, the highest, so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 72, the highest, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 92, the highest, so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 93, the highest, so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 84, the highest, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 57, the highest, so allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, and 6
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, and 5

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
