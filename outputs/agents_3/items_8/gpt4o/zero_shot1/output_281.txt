Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  20  47  59   1  11  22  92
1   2  83   2  40  85  90   8  23
2  65  44  37  85  84  99  94  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We can approach this by considering the valuations and attempting to balance the allocations so that each agent gets a reasonable share according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations and find a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (92), Item 3 (59), Item 2 (47)
   - Medium values: Item 6 (22), Item 1 (20)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (90), Item 4 (85), Item 1 (83)
   - Medium values: Item 3 (40)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 6 (94), Item 3 (85)
   - Medium values: Item 4 (84), Item 7 (72)

Given these preferences, we can try to distribute the items to balance the preferences:

- Agent 0 could receive items that they value the most but aren't as highly valued by others, like Item 2 and Item 6.
- Agent 1 could receive high-value items such as Item 4 and Item 1, which are also valued highly by them.
- Agent 2, having high values for items like Item 5 and Item 3, can receive those.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2, Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 4, Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 5, Item 3

Now, allocate the remaining items based on the remaining values:

- **Agent 0**: Add Item 7 (high value)
- **Agent 1**: Add Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Add Item 3 (already allocated), so add Item 0

Finally, let's put this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 1, 0],
    "2": [5, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items that they value reasonably well, given the constraints.
