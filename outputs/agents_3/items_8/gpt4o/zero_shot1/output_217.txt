Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  15  66   3  55   6  88   0
1  18  29  14  61  63  25  67  84
2  10  57  13  90  69  55  40  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 29 14 61 63 25 67 84]
 [10 57 13 90 69 55 40 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are assigned.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so we can assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so we can assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so we can assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. For the remaining items, we can distribute them based on the next highest valuations:

   - Give item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Give item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 1 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```
