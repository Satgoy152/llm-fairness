Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  78  63  18   5   9  11  94
1  55  90   1  52  41  38   8  92
2  46  11   4  32  26  74  77  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value.

Let's start by evaluating and assigning items based on the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 31
  - Agent 1 values it at 55
  - Agent 2 values it at 46
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 78
  - Agent 1 values it at 90
  - Agent 2 values it at 11
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 63
  - Agent 1 values it at 1
  - Agent 2 values it at 4
  - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 18
  - Agent 1 values it at 52
  - Agent 2 values it at 32
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 5
  - Agent 1 values it at 41
  - Agent 2 values it at 26
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 9
  - Agent 1 values it at 38
  - Agent 2 values it at 74
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

- Item 6:
  - Agent 0 values it at 11
  - Agent 1 values it at 8
  - Agent 2 values it at 77
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

- Item 7:
  - Agent 0 values it at 94
  - Agent 1 values it at 92
  - Agent 2 values it at 61
  - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

After assigning based on highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6

Since this allocation respects the initial condition to allocate all 8 items and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
