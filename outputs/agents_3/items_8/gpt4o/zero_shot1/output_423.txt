Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67   3  87  20  29  72  43  63
1  93  92  79  79  54  36  10   0
2  61  29  25  87  17  99  63  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67  3 87 20 29 72 43 63]
 [93 92 79 79 54 36 10  0]
 [61 29 25 87 17 99 63 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

One common method to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash Social Welfare, which is the product of the valuations received by each agent. However, since our problem is relatively small, we can manually inspect and assign items to try and achieve a balanced allocation.

Let's evaluate the process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (87), Item 0 (67), Item 5 (72)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 1 (92), Item 2 (79), Item 3 (79)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (99), Item 3 (87), Item 6 (63), Item 7 (43)

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 2 (87) and Item 0 (67)
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 1 (92) and Item 3 (79)
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 5 (99), Item 6 (63), and Item 7 (43)
  
Item 4 is still unallocated. We can allocate it to Agent 1 since Agent 1 has fewer items and also benefits from having another item, even though it has a low valuation for it compared to others.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 6, 7]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
