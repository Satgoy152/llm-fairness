Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  73  24  98  60  81  25  68
1   1  25  92  56  21  13  33  86
2  91   1  34  81  83  37  71  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

We can use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate the items:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Allocate the item to that agent.
3. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method to the given data:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Agent 2 Value | Highest Value Agent |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 0    | 31            | 1             | 91            | Agent 2             |
| 1    | 73            | 25            | 1             | Agent 0             |
| 2    | 24            | 92            | 34            | Agent 1             |
| 3    | 98            | 56            | 81            | Agent 0             |
| 4    | 60            | 21            | 83            | Agent 2             |
| 5    | 81            | 13            | 37            | Agent 0             |
| 6    | 25            | 33            | 71            | Agent 2             |
| 7    | 68            | 86            | 46            | Agent 1             |

Based on the highest value for each item, the allocations will be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 6

Let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are allocated based on the agents' highest valuations.
