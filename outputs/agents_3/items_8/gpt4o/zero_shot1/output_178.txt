Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  43  74  43  42   5  42  51
1  74  98  20  13  19  59  73  54
2   0  72  82  63   9   0  71  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Additionally, each agent should ideally receive a number of items proportionate to their valuations.

Let's start by considering a strategy that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (74), Item 1 (43), Item 3 (43), Item 4 (42), Item 6 (42), Item 7 (51)
   - Choose items with highest valuations for Agent 0: [0, 7]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (74), Item 6 (73), Item 7 (54), Item 5 (59)
   - Choose items with highest valuations for Agent 1: [1, 5]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (82), Item 1 (72), Item 3 (63), Item 6 (71)
   - Choose items with highest valuations for Agent 2: [2, 3, 4, 6]

Let's ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent gets items:

Allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
