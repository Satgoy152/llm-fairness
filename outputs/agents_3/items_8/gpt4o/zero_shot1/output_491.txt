Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  17  12   8  34  77  92  48
1  43  18  14  30  96  16  55  78
2  22  14  92  76  69   1   5  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 17 12  8 34 77 92 48]
 [43 18 14 30 96 16 55 78]
 [22 14 92 76 69  1  5 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. A straightforward approach is to allocate items one-by-one to the agent who values them the most. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. For item 0, the highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 43.
2. For item 1, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 17.
3. For item 2, the highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 92.
4. For item 3, the highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 76.
5. For item 4, the highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 96.
6. For item 5, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 77.
7. For item 6, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 92.
8. For item 7, the highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 78.

Based on these allocations, here is the final result:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly while distributing the total number of items fairly.
