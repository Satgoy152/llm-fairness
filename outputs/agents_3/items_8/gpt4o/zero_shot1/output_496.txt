Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  15  16  24  17  63  33  87
1  81  74  85  21  22   9   6  98
2  79  91  32  16  52  56  79  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets approximately the same total value, while considering the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 prefers items 0 and 7 (highest values: 72 and 87).
2. Agent 1 prefers items 2 and 7 (highest values: 85 and 98).
3. Agent 2 prefers items 1 and 6 (highest values: 91 and 79).

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences while ensuring every agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3 (values 72, 24)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7 (values 85, 98)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 5, 6 (values 91, 52, 56, 79)

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 gets items with a total valuation of 96 (72 + 24).
- Agent 1 gets items with a total valuation of 183 (85 + 98).
- Agent 2 gets items with a total valuation of 278 (91 + 52 + 56 + 79).

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items with a focus on maximizing their total valuation based on their preferences.
