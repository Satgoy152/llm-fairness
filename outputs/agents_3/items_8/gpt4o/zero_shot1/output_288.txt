Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  59  37  46  64  26  84  30
1  10  85  26  69  37  99  38  11
2  82  32  85  19  20  79  64  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuations each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 82.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 64.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most at 72.

After assigning items based on the highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```
