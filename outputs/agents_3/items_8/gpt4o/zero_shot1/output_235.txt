Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  73  46  47  33   9  53  32
1  16  74  13  58  49  81  60  64
2  61  46  19  88  73  17  54   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 8 items are allocated.

We can use a method like the "round-robin allocation" or "sequential allocation" where each agent picks their highest-valued item in turns until all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 87)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 81)
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 88)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 73)
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 64)
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 73)

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 53)
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 13)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [5, 7, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 3 agents, taking into account their valuations as much as possible. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and we ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
