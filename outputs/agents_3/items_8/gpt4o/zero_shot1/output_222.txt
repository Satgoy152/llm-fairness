Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1   2  86  26  23  37   2  75
1  38  98  59  73  16  99  28  88
2  58  30  72  45  72  90   0  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is through the "maximum sum of valuations" for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items. Let's try to distribute the items as evenly as possible while maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 0, 1, 6
  - Total Valuation: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 3, 5, 7
  - Total Valuation: 73 + 99 + 88 = 260

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items: 2, 4
  - Total Valuation: 72 + 72 = 144

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
