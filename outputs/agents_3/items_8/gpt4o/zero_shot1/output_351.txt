Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70   9  49  53  66  20  61  10
1  79  32  49  49  26  59  71  23
2  34  39  82  44  38  79   1  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. We aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (70) and item 4 (66).
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0 (79), but it is already allocated to Agent 0. Next, Agent 1 values item 6 (71) and item 5 (59).
   - Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (82) and item 5 (79), but item 5 is already allocated to Agent 1. Next, Agent 2 values item 3 (44).
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, leaving 2 more items (1 and 7) to be allocated.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - For item 1:
     - Agent 0 values it at 9.
     - Agent 1 values it at 32.
     - Agent 2 values it at 39.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.

   - For item 7:
     - Agent 0 values it at 10.
     - Agent 1 values it at 23.
     - Agent 2 values it at 13.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
