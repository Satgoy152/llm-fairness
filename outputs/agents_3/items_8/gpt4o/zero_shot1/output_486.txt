Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  60  62  70  80  59  19  32
1  71  63   3  52  55  35  35  62
2  69  51  56  87  79  81  38  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 63  3 52 55 35 35 62]
 [69 51 56 87 79 81 38 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A good approach to achieve this is to use a greedy method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This can help ensure that each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (83).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (60).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (62).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (87).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (81).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (38).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (62).

Now, we will ensure each agent gets at least one item by making some adjustments, if necessary:

1. Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 1 gets item: 7.
3. Agent 2 gets items: 3, 5, and 6.

This allocation gives Agent 0 four items, Agent 1 one item, and Agent 2 three items, which totals up to 8 items, as required.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
