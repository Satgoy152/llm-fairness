Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  72  49  62  12  99  86  52
1  77  21  23  74  78  71  48  83
2  86  81  86  17  53  36  57  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation. One common approach to achieve fairness is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign items to the agent that values them the most, provided that the agent doesn't exceed the fair share of items.

Given that there are 3 agents and 8 items, one way to distribute the items is to ensure that each agent gets approximately 2 or 3 items. Let's proceed with this allocation method:

1. List all items and their valuations by each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent gets more than 3 items (since 8 items divided among 3 agents is approximately 2.67 items per agent).

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (97).
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (81).
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 2 (86).
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (74).
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (78).
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (99).
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (86).
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 2 (85).

After assigning based on the highest valuation, let's check and adjust to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 7]

Each agent receives a fair number of items (2 or 3), and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
