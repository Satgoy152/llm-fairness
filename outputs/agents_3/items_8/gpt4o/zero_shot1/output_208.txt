Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  26  90  58  19  10  87  57
1  20   5  21  16  21   6  46  43
2  93  27   3  88  92  91  17   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the total values for each agent if they receive various items and aim for a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High-value items: 0, 2, 6 (values: 79, 90, 87)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High-value items: 6, 7 (values: 46, 43)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High-value items: 0, 3, 4, 5 (values: 93, 88, 92, 91)

Considering these high-value items for each agent, we can allocate the items as follows to ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, 6 (total value: 79 + 90 + 87 = 256)
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 7 (total value: 5 + 43 = 48)
- Agent 2 gets items 3, 4, 5 (total value: 88 + 92 + 91 = 271)

This allocation does not leave any agent without items and provides a reasonable distribution of total value among the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
