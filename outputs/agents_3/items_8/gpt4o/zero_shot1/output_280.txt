Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  45  39  38  63  14  64  57
1  37  99   4  36   7  92  38  14
2   1  63  75  78  65  45  52   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. One common method is the round-robin allocation, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's turn:** Choose item 6 (value 64).
2. **Agent 1's turn:** Choose item 1 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2's turn:** Choose item 3 (value 78).
4. **Agent 0's turn:** Choose item 4 (value 63).
5. **Agent 1's turn:** Choose item 5 (value 92).
6. **Agent 2's turn:** Choose item 2 (value 75).
7. **Agent 0's turn:** Choose item 7 (value 57).
8. **Agent 1's turn:** Choose item 0 (value 37).

Now let's allocate the items according to this process:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation method ensures that each agent gets a chance to pick items based on their priority, aiming for fairness by considering their valuations.
