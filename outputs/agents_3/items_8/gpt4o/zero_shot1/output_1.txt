Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  76  53  73  13  23  66  60
1  18  75  54  75  37  68  39  76
2  80   8  54  58  77  54  99  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 76 53 73 13 23 66 60]
 [18 75 54 75 37 68 39 76]
 [80  8 54 58 77 54 99 68]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use a method like a "greedy algorithm" where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 62.
   - Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Agent 2 values it at 80. 
   - Assign to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76.
   - Agent 1 values it at 75.
   - Agent 2 values it at 8.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53.
   - Agent 1 values it at 54.
   - Agent 2 values it at 54.
   - Assign to Agent 1 (or Agent 2, as they tie, but we will break ties in favor of the least allocated agent).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Agent 1 values it at 75.
   - Agent 2 values it at 58.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 13.
   - Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Agent 2 values it at 77.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 68.
   - Agent 2 values it at 54.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66.
   - Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Agent 2 values it at 99.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 60.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Agent 2 values it at 68.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 4, 6]

Finally, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
