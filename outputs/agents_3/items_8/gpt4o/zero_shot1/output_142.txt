Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  65  13  26  37  96  42  73
1  42   0  31  77  37  92  56  18
2  57  14  93  15  20   9  41   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here, we will try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is reasonably balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Preferable items based on high valuation are 5, 1, 7.
- Agent 1: Preferable items based on high valuation are 3, 5, 6.
- Agent 2: Preferable items based on high valuation are 2, 0, 1.

To ensure fairness, let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets items 1, 5 (high valuations: 65, 96).
2. Agent 1 gets items 3, 6 (high valuations: 77, 56).
3. Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, 4, 7 (high valuations: 57, 93, 20, 8).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of items allocated is 8.
