Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  83  54  15  67  44  26  50
1  87  85  65   1   9  40  26  39
2  56  71  97  63   5  84  15  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 85 65  1  9 40 26 39]
 [56 71 97 63  5 84 15 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. One potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Here's how we can do it for this problem:

1. List all the items with their valuations for each agent.
2. Sort the items based on the highest valuation by any agent.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the total number of items allocated is eight.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 63.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 26.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 50.

Let's ensure that each agent receives a fair allocation. Currently, agent 0 has 5 items, agent 2 has 3 items, and agent 1 has 0 items, which is unfair.

To balance the allocation, let's reassign some items:

- Reallocate item 6 to agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 26, and it balances the distribution).

Here's the final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 5

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
