Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  48  13  56  92  41  72  34
1  63   4  41  19  75  62  46  71
2   6  11  30  97  75  41  32  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 11 30 97 75 41 32 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (63).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (48).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (41).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (97).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 75, but since Agent 2 has fewer high-value options available, assign it to Agent 2.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (41).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (72).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (71).

Now, let's create the allocation based on these choices:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
