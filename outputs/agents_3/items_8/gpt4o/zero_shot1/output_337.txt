Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  46  18  82  18  29  40  58
1   3   7   0  37  84  48  52  24
2  77  74  71  55  77  22  55  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent gets from the items they receive. 

Let's analyze the table to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 7 (58)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 4 (84), Item 5 (48)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (77), Item 1 (74), Item 2 (71), Item 7 (95)

To distribute the items fairly, we could try to maximize the valuation of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets: Item 3 (82), Item 7 (58) [Total = 140]
- **Agent 1** gets: Item 4 (84), Item 5 (48) [Total = 132]
- **Agent 2** gets: Item 0 (77), Item 1 (74), Item 2 (71), Item 6 (55) [Total = 277]

This allocation gives each agent a good valuation based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 6]
}
```
