Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  82  87  79  63  21  73  41
1  73  71  10  26  62  91   9   3
2  81  89  12  23  81  69  92  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider the valuations provided. Our goal is to maximize total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify high valuations**: Start by determining which items each agent values the most.
   
2. **Initial allocation**: Allocate items based on the highest value for each agent ensuring that every agent receives at least one item.

3. **Balance the distribution**: Adjust the allocation to ensure that the total number of items allocated is 8, while maximizing the total value and ensuring fairness.

Let's begin:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
  
- **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest.
  
- **Agent 2** values items 6 and 1 the highest.

Initially, let's allocate one high-value item to each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 98)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (value 91)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (value 92)

Now, allocate the remaining items while considering the next highest valuations:

- Allocate item 1 to **Agent 2** (value 89) for a higher overall valuation.
- Allocate item 2 to **Agent 0** (value 87) to use the high valuation.
- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 0** (value 79) as it has another reasonable valuation.
- Allocate item 4 to **Agent 1** (value 62) as it balances the load among agents.
- Allocate item 7 to **Agent 2** (value 33) as it fits well with the leftover items.

Final allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 6, 7]

This allocation maximizes the value while ensuring fair distribution among agents. Hereâ€™s the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
