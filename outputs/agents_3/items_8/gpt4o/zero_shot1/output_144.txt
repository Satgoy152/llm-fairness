Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  85  49  85  16   1  76  95
1  37  68  87  66  52  98  99  63
2  54  73  98  64  65  55   2  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will attempt to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 3 (85), Item 1 (85), Item 6 (76)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (99), Item 5 (98), Item 2 (87), Item 1 (68)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (98), Item 7 (93), Item 1 (73), Item 4 (65)

We aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they highly value, without any overlaps. Let's start by assigning the highest valued items and adjusting to ensure a fair distribution of items:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value, 99).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (highest value, 95).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value, 98).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value, 98).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value, 85).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (9).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (65).

Now, we have one item left (Item 1). Based on remaining preferences:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (68), as Agent 1 currently has fewer items.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, ensuring that all items are distributed.
