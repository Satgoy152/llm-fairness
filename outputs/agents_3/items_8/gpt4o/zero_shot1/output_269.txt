Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  78  31  43  15  46  13  50
1  28  34  16   1  13  41   2  94
2   6  67  98  86  22  46  30   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. This approach is often referred to as maximizing social welfare, where we try to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, while keeping the allocation balanced.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 (78) and item 0 (59) highly compared to others. 

2. **Agent 1** values item 7 (94) highly compared to other items they value. 

3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (98) and item 3 (86) highly compared to others.

Based on this information, we can try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3, 4, and 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value and distributes all 8 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
