Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  12  76  46  28   7  22  16
1  14  48   4  11  60  44  91  84
2  94  85   6  73  73   6  48  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can apply the following strategy: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, maximizing overall satisfaction. Let's determine the allocations based on the given values:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 85
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 91
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 84
   - Agent 2 values it at 18
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

Now, let's summarize the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated to the agents who value them the most.
