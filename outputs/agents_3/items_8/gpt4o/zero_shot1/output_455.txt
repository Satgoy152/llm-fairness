Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  34  76  96  97  86  14  68
1   4  60  74  43  31  11  52  84
2  96  90  42  34  60  65  48  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 34 76 96 97 86 14 68]
 [ 4 60 74 43 31 11 52 84]
 [96 90 42 34 60 65 48 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given that there are more items than agents.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are items 4 (value 97) and 3 (value 96).
   - Allocate items 4 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining highest value item for Agent 1 is item 7 (value 84).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are items 0 (value 96) and 1 (value 90).
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 5 (value 65) for Agent 2.
- Item 6 (value 52) for Agent 1.

Finally, we have:

- Item 2 is left, allocate it to Agent 0 for a value of 76.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 2],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and all 8 items are allocated.
