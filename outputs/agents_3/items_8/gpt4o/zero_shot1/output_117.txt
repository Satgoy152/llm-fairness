Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51   2  27  13  29  45  10  40
1  92  43  52  77  65  20  40  19
2  79  45  80   8   2  68  49  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent over all items.**  
   This gives us an idea of which agent values the items more overall.

2. **Assign items to agents based on their highest individual valuations.**  
   This ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items.**  
   Since there are 8 items and 3 agents, ideally, one agent will get 2 items and the other two will get 3 items each.

Let's go through the procedure:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 51 + 2 + 27 + 13 + 29 + 45 + 10 + 40 = 217
   - Agent 1: 92 + 43 + 52 + 77 + 65 + 20 + 40 + 19 = 408
   - Agent 2: 79 + 45 + 80 + 8 + 2 + 68 + 49 + 32 = 363

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 43.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 80.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 65.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 68.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 49.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 40.

3. **Adjust to Ensure Fair Distribution:**

   - Agent 1 has 4 items (0, 1, 3, 4), Agent 2 has 3 items (2, 5, 6), and Agent 0 has 1 item (7).
   - To balance, we can adjust by giving one of Agent 1's lower-valued items to Agent 0. For instance, give item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items [1, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 4]
   - Agent 2: Items [2, 5, 6]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total items based on their valuations.
