Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  88  96  28  72  99  39  49
1  79  86  28  41   6   7  39  12
2  82  96  30  62  64  63  91  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 88 96 28 72 99 39 49]
 [79 86 28 41  6  7 39 12]
 [82 96 30 62 64 63 91 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the highest valuations for Agent 0, we can allocate:
   - Item 5 (valuation 99)
   - Item 2 (valuation 96)
   - Item 1 (valuation 88)

2. **Agent 1**: We allocate items to Agent 1 based on their highest remaining valuations:
   - Item 0 (valuation 79)
   - Item 3 (valuation 41)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items to Agent 2, focusing on their highest valuations:
   - Item 6 (valuation 91)
   - Item 4 (valuation 64)
   - Item 7 (valuation 39)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least some items, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Below is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6, 4, 7]
}
```
