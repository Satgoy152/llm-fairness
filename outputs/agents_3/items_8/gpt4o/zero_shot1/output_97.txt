Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  45  44  74  60  64  81  27
1  25  25  39  88  62  45  99  82
2  19  15  61  14  12  16  69  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. One way to approach this is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and allocating them accordingly, ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 6, 7.
3. Agent 2 has relatively lower valuations, but we will ensure they get items.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: items 0, 4, 5 (total valuation = 85 + 60 + 64 = 209)
- Agent 1: items 3, 6, 7 (total valuation = 88 + 99 + 82 = 269)
- Agent 2: items 1, 2 (total valuation = 15 + 61 = 76)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, and all 8 items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
