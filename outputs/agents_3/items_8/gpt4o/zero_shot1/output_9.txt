Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  35  27  37  82  47  68  57
1  63  29  58  36  54  55   2  15
2  25  86   3  69  30  44  62  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives an equitable number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 3 agents, a balanced allocation would be for each agent to receive approximately 2 to 3 items.

Hereâ€™s one possible approach to achieving a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 4, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values items 0, 2, and 5 the most.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 1 and 3.

Considering the above preferences, we can allocate the items as follows to approximate fairness:

- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 3, 5, and 7.

This allocation tries to balance the number of items each agent receives and their preferences based on their valuations. Here's how this allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents while considering their valuations.
