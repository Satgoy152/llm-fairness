Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69   0  76  93  20  33  59  24
1  97  12  41  92  12  67  46  92
2  68  85  25  28  64  16  32  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each item is assigned to one agent, and that the allocation is as balanced as possible based on the given valuations. There are multiple approaches to do this, such as maximizing the total valuation or ensuring a fair distribution by some other criteria. Here, I'll aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. 

Let's consider the total value each agent perceives from all items and aim to allocate items in a way that tries to balance these perceived values.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest value for this agent.
   - Items: 3 (value 93), 2 (value 76), 0 (value 69)

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest value for this agent.
   - Items: 0 (value 97), 7 (value 92), 3 (value 92)

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with the highest value for this agent.
   - Items: 1 (value 85), 4 (value 64), 0 (value 68)

### Adjusted Allocation:
To ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent, and considering all items, let's adjust the allocations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation).

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, considering the highest valuations each agent has for different items.
