Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16   8  10  70  72  29  72  98
1  75  14  82  75  54  78  19  27
2  15  69  76  66  34  40  93  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider their valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. One approach is to use a greedy method, where we iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's apply this approach:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the respective agent.

2. Keep track of the number of items each agent receives and ensure no agent receives more than the fair share initially.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 1 (75)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 2 (69)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 1 (82)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 0 (70)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 0 (72)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 1 (78)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 2 (93)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 0 (98)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair number of items. We have:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6]
}
```
