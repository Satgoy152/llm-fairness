Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  79  75  51  79  53  74  13
1  89  90  73  67  24  18  97  20
2  15  78  93  55  85  59  77  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can do this by aiming to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign items to agents by comparing their valuations for each item.
2. Ensure each agent has an integer number of items.
3. Ensure all items are assigned.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make the allocations:

- Agent 0: 
  - High valuations: 79 (item 1), 75 (item 2), 74 (item 6)
- Agent 1:
  - High valuations: 90 (item 1), 89 (item 0), 97 (item 6)
- Agent 2:
  - High valuations: 93 (item 2), 85 (item 4), 78 (item 1), 77 (item 6)

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (valuation 89).
- Allocate item 1 to agent 0 (valuation 79).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (valuation 93).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (valuation 51).
- Allocate item 4 to agent 2 (valuation 85).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 0 (valuation 53).
- Allocate item 6 to agent 1 (valuation 97).
- Allocate item 7 to agent 2 (valuation 12).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
