Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  96  35  13  67  49  63  24
1  55  55  21  97  73  84  93   4
2  54  83  47  74  39  57  38  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a strategy that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the items one by one and assign them accordingly:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0: 79
   - Agent 1: 55
   - Agent 2: 54
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0: 96
   - Agent 1: 55
   - Agent 2: 83
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0: 35
   - Agent 1: 21
   - Agent 2: 47
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0: 13
   - Agent 1: 97
   - Agent 2: 74
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0: 67
   - Agent 1: 73
   - Agent 2: 39
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0: 49
   - Agent 1: 84
   - Agent 2: 57
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0: 63
   - Agent 1: 93
   - Agent 2: 38
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value)

8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 0: 24
   - Agent 1: 4
   - Agent 2: 39
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value)

Now, the complete allocation of items looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while all items are allocated among the agents.
