Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  18  82  24  31  99  11  82
1  55  36  49  61  15  22  80  86
2  99  97  10  17  58  40   2  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 97 10 17 58 40  2 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each receives at least two items, as there are 8 items and 3 agents. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Assign Items to Maximize Value for Each Agent:**

   - For Agent 0:
     - Item 0 (Value: 88) - Highest value for this agent.
     - Item 2 (Value: 82) - Second highest value for this agent.

   - For Agent 1:
     - Item 7 (Value: 86) - Highest value for this agent.
     - Item 3 (Value: 61) - Second highest value for this agent.

   - For Agent 2:
     - Item 1 (Value: 97) - Highest value for this agent.
     - Item 0 is already assigned to Agent 0; choose Item 4 (Value: 58) - Next highest value.

2. **Assign Remaining Items to Balance Allocations:**

   - For Agent 0:
     - Item 5 (Value: 99) - Highest remaining value for any agent.

   - For Agent 2:
     - Item 6 (Value: 2) - Remaining unallocated item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least two items, and the total value received by each agent is reasonably balanced.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
