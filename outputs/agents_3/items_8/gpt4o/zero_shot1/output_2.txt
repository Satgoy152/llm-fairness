Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  76  56  39  21  23  77  59
1  38  33  45  34  41   8  35  89
2  58  86  78  96  81  26  93  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items to agents in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly, ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the table:

```
Items:
0: Agent 0 (36), Agent 1 (38), Agent 2 (58)
1: Agent 0 (76), Agent 1 (33), Agent 2 (86)
2: Agent 0 (56), Agent 1 (45), Agent 2 (78)
3: Agent 0 (39), Agent 1 (34), Agent 2 (96)
4: Agent 0 (21), Agent 1 (41), Agent 2 (81)
5: Agent 0 (23), Agent 1 (8),  Agent 2 (26)
6: Agent 0 (77), Agent 1 (35), Agent 2 (93)
7: Agent 0 (59), Agent 1 (89), Agent 2 (62)
```

Let's allocate items based on the highest value:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (58).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (86).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (78).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (96).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (81).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (23).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (89).

Initially, Agent 2 values most items the highest. However, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

Let's adjust the allocation to make sure each agent gets a balanced number of items:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (77), Item 5 (23)
- Agent 1: Item 7 (89), Item 3 (34)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (58), Item 1 (86), Item 2 (78), Item 4 (81)

Now, we have fairly distributed the items, ensuring each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
