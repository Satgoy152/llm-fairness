Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  31  76  33  82  54  56  45
1  46  44  43  90  34   7  68  34
2  88  42  23  24  72   8  94  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 31 76 33 82 54 56 45]
 [46 44 43 90 34  7 68 34]
 [88 42 23 24 72  8 94 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can achieve this by considering the highest-valued items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 
   - Item 0: 89
   - Item 4: 82
   - Item 2: 76

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 3: 90
   - Item 0: 46 (already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Item 6: 68

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 6: 94 (already allocated to Agent 1)
   - Item 0: 88 (already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Item 7: 87
   
By considering these high-valued items while ensuring a fair allocation, we can proceed as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 4] (values: 89, 82)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [3, 6] (values: 90, 68)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [7, 2, 5, 1] (values: 87, 23, 8, 42)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations while distributing all 8 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7, 2, 5, 1]
}
```
