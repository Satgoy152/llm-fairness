Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  18   0  46  66  63  70  47
1  93   3  15  55  14  24  50  76
2  19  75  43  98  58  69  50  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. One approach could be to assign items based on the highest relative value for each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (70), Item 4 (66), Item 5 (63)
   - Allocate: Items 6, 4, 5

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (93), Item 7 (76), Item 3 (55)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 7, 3

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 1 (75), Item 5 (69)
   - Allocate: Items 2, 1

Now, let's make sure each item is only allocated once, ensuring a total of 8 items are allocated. Let's adjust the allocations to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 3, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, 6

This allocation respects the total number of items (8) and ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations. Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
