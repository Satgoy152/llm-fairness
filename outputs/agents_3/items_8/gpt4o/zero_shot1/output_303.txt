Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  80  89  59   9  46  55  12
1  76  88  49  41  43  87   1  70
2  15  92  11  40  39  67  23  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 92 11 40 39 67 23 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to do this:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 1 (80), Item 3 (59), Item 0 (47)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (88), Item 0 (76), Item 5 (87), Item 7 (70)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (92), Item 5 (67), Item 3 (40)

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least some items if possible.
  
### Allocation Plan:
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: [2, 3] 
   - Total Valuation: 89 (Item 2) + 59 (Item 3) = 148

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: [1, 5, 7] 
   - Total Valuation: 88 (Item 1) + 87 (Item 5) + 70 (Item 7) = 245

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: [0, 4, 6] 
   - Total Valuation: 15 (Item 0) + 39 (Item 4) + 23 (Item 6) = 77

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences.
