Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72   4  41   3  67  55  52  75
1  98  45  96  25  79  89  90  32
2  70  38  49  36  93  16  91  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One straightforward approach is to use a "maximum sum" or "greedy" allocation strategy, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would look step-by-step:

1. For each item, find the agent that values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.

Let's perform this allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 98 (Agent 1)
- Item 1: Highest value is 45 (Agent 1)
- Item 2: Highest value is 96 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 36 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: Highest value is 93 (Agent 2)
- Item 5: Highest value is 89 (Agent 1)
- Item 6: Highest value is 91 (Agent 2)
- Item 7: Highest value is 90 (Agent 2)

Now, let's check the distribution:

Agent 0: 0 items
Agent 1: 4 items (0, 1, 2, 5)
Agent 2: 4 items (3, 4, 6, 7)

As each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items have been allocated, this allocation should suffice.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
