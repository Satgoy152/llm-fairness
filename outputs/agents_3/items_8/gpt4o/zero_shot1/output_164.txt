Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  53   0  21  32  39  29  19
1  63   0  78  72  20  31  22  62
2  64  62  39  35  87   0  32  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One possible way to approach this allocation is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Since there are three agents and eight items, one agent will receive two items, and two agents will receive three items each.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Assign items with the highest values to this agent first. The highest values for agent 0 are for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1: Next, assign items with the highest remaining values to agent 1. The highest values for agent 1 are for items 2, 3, and 7.
- Agent 2: Finally, assign the remaining items to agent 2. The highest values for agent 2 are for items 4 and 6.

Following this approach, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible from the remaining available items.
