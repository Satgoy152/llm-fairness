Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  16  25  52  22  46  53  64
1  69  98  61  60  71  94  63  42
2  92  89  29  87  66   1  72  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 98 61 60 71 94 63 42]
 [92 89 29 87 66  1 72 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation based on their preferences. A common approach is to use a method that tries to ensure each agent is as satisfied as possible, given their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 7 the highest with a valuation of 64. Let's assign item 7 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the highest with a valuation of 98. Let's assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 92. Let's assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. After assigning the items with the highest valuations for each agent, we move to the next highest valuations for the remaining items.
5. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 6 with a valuation of 53. Assign item 6 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 5 with a valuation of 94. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
7. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 7 with a valuation of 95. However, item 7 is already assigned, so we move to the next available highest valuation, which is item 3 with a valuation of 87. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest available item is item 4 with a valuation of 66. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
9. **Agent 0**: The remaining item is item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

Now, each agent should have a nearly balanced distribution of total valuation, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
