Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  89  47  41  88  24  41  49
1  93  72  47  54   0  61  99  51
2  40  60  64  87  81  27  83  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 72 47 54  0 61 99 51]
 [40 60 64 87 81 27 83 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items or at least some items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest values for Agent 0: Item 1 (89), Item 4 (88)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest values for Agent 1: Item 0 (93), Item 6 (99)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest values for Agent 2: Item 3 (87), Item 2 (64)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are distributed and each agent has at least one item:

- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (Value: 61 for Agent 1)
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0 (Value: 49 for Agent 0)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their preferences, maximizing their total valuation while distributing all items among the agents.
