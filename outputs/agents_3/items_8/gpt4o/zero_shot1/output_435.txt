Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  33  56  18  58  31  87  40
1  65  87  89  80  65  76  85  51
2  92  84  38  87  77  46  17  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve that:

1. **List the valuations for each agent** to determine which items they value the most.
2. **Sort the items** based on each agent's valuation in descending order.
3. **Allocate items** to each agent, ensuring each gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: [30, 33, 56, 18, 58, 31, 87, 40]
- **Agent 1's valuations**: [65, 87, 89, 80, 65, 76, 85, 51]
- **Agent 2's valuations**: [92, 84, 38, 87, 77, 46, 17, 72]

Now, let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 6 (87), followed by item 4 (58).
   - Let's allocate items [6, 4] to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (89), followed by item 1 (87), and item 3 (80).
   - Let's allocate items [2, 1, 3] to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (92), followed by item 3 (87).
   - Items 4, 5, and 7 are next highest valued.
   - Let's allocate items [0, 7, 5] to Agent 2.

Check for any unallocated items and adjust if necessary. In this case, all items are allocated, and each agent is receiving a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [2, 1, 3],
    "2": [0, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents with consideration to their valuations.
