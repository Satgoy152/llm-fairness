Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  58  73  25  59  63  25  16
1  97  67  37  93  93  75  17   4
2  51  91   1  58  37  92   5  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their total value. Let's do the allocations step by step:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items: 2 (73), 5 (63), and 4 (59).
2. **Agent 1** has particularly high values for items: 0 (97), 3 (93), and 4 (93).
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items: 1 (91), 5 (92), and 7 (33).

### Allocation Strategy:

Let's allocate items by selecting one high-value item for each agent and then continue balancing the allocation:

- **Agent 1** should get item 0 (value 97), item 3 (value 93), and item 4 (value 93) since these are the highest values among all items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** should get item 1 (value 91) and item 5 (value 92) since these are the highest values among all items for Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** should get item 2 (value 73), item 6 (value 25), and item 7 (value 16) as these are the remaining items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, and all 8 items are allocated with respect to maximizing each agent's total value.
