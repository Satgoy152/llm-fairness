Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  17  79  32   8  81  27  29
1  15  63  44  19  29   8  12  65
2  41  32  92  74  30  70   8  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and aim to maximize their satisfaction. This is often a complex optimization problem, but we can attempt a simple heuristic approach to get an equitable distribution.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 89). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (value 65). Assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 92). Assign item 2 to agent 2.

Remaining items: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

- For the remaining items, we look at the next highest values for each agent:
  - Agent 0: item 5 (value 81)
  - Agent 1: item 1 (value 63)
  - Agent 2: item 7 was already allocated, next is item 3 (value 74)

Assign:
- Item 5 to Agent 0
- Item 1 to Agent 1
- Item 3 to Agent 2

Remaining items: 4, 6

- Continue with the next highest values for the remaining items:
  - Agent 0: item 2 was already allocated, next is item 6 (value 27)
  - Agent 1: item 7 was already allocated, next is item 3 (value 19)
  - Agent 2: item 4 (value 30)

Assign:
- Item 6 to Agent 0
- Item 4 to Agent 2

All items have been assigned. Let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed fairly.
