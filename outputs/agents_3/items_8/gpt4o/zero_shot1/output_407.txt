Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  72  58   4  75  68  50  42
1  49  21  41   5  56  53  77  79
2  52   0   1  27  79  73  43   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm that assigns items based on the highest value-to-agent ratio, or alternatively, by ensuring each agent ends up with similar total valuations.

To achieve a fair allocation of items:

1. Gather the valuations from the table:
   - Agent 0: [0, 72, 58, 4, 75, 68, 50, 42]
   - Agent 1: [49, 21, 41, 5, 56, 53, 77, 79]
   - Agent 2: [52, 0, 1, 27, 79, 73, 43, 9]

2. Assign items to agents, trying to balance the total valuation for each agent.

The allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0 receives items with high value for them, maximizing their valuation.
- Agent 1 receives items that maximize their valuation while ensuring fairness.
- Agent 2 receives items that result in a balanced distribution of total valuations.

Here's one potential fair allocation, calculated by distributing items to maximize each agent's utility while keeping the total distribution fair:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuations each agent receives, ensuring all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.
