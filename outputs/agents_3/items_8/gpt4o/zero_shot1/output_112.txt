Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  77  77  39  13  86  55   6
1  63  61  12  33  57  42  47  46
2  53  48  68  60  98  43  31  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 48 68 60 98 43 31 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the total value received by each agent. Let's allocate the items in such a way that each agent gets a similar total value, or at least the distribution appears balanced.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [81, 77, 77, 39, 13, 86, 55, 6]
- Agent 1: [63, 61, 12, 33, 57, 42, 47, 46]
- Agent 2: [53, 48, 68, 60, 98, 43, 31, 52]

We'll aim to distribute these items as evenly as possible in terms of value.

1. Start by assigning the highest value items to each agent if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives items to balance the overall value distribution.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5
  - Total value: 81 + 77 + 86 = 244
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 7
  - Total value: 33 + 57 + 46 = 136
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
  - Total value: 68 + 31 = 99

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of total values among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```
