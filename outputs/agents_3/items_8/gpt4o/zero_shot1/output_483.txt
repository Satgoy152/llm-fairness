Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  88  75  73  68  12   1  52
1  20  15  30  40  27  81  30  10
2  15  93  68  37  20  76   0  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agentâ€™s preferences while ensuring that every item is allocated. One approach is to focus on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Here's a potential allocation that considers maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [55, 88, 75, 73, 68, 12, 1, 52]
   - Select items with highest valuations: 1 (88), 2 (75), 0 (55)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [20, 15, 30, 40, 27, 81, 30, 10]
   - Select items with highest valuations: 5 (81), 3 (40)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuations: [15, 93, 68, 37, 20, 76, 0, 20]
   - Select items with highest valuations: 6 (0), 7 (20), 4 (20)

Now, let's summarize these allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
