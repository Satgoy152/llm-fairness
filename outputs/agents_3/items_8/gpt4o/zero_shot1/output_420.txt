Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  40  87   7  68  35  63  70
1  84  55  33  48  40  36  13  67
2  13  14  79  67  32   5  81  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 3 agents, we want to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Look at the highest-valued items for each agent and try to allocate those first.
2. Iterate through each agent and try to allocate items that maximize their satisfaction, while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Let's start by allocating items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 2 (87), Item 7 (70), Item 4 (68)
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest values: Item 0 (84), Item 1 (55), Item 7 (67)
  
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest values: Item 6 (81), Item 2 (79), Item 3 (67)

Let's allocate based on these values:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate Item 2 (87) and Item 7 (70)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate Item 0 (84) and Item 1 (55)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate Item 6 (81) and Item 3 (67)

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

- **Remaining items**: 4, 5

We will allocate the remaining based on the next highest values:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Next highest: Item 4 (68)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Next highest: Item 4 (40)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Next highest: Item 5 (5), Item 4 (32)

Allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate Item 4 (68)

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate Item 5 (36)

Now, each agent has 2 or 3 items, and all 8 items have been allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [6, 3]
}
```
