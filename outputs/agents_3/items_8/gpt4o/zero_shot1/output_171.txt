Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  15   2  49   8  24  22  62
1   6  42  99   3  49  51  44  43
2  11  77  47   4  96  87  66  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 77 47  4 96 87 66 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Follow the same principle for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Follow the same principle for agent 2.

We start by examining the valuation matrix and making selections:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 7 (62) and 3 (49).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 2 (99) and 5 (51).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 4 (96) and 5 (87).

We then look for the next highest unallocated items for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 5 (24), but it's already allocated. Item 6 (22) is next.
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 (49) and 6 (44) are next.
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 (77) and 6 (66) are next. Item 6 is already allocated.

Attempting to balance allocations, we want each agent to have approximately the same number of items:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 7 and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 2 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 1, 5, and 6.

However, this brings us to 7 items in total. We need to allocate 1 more item:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (10).

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
