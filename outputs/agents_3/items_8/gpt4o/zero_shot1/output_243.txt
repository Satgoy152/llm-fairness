Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  98  84  79  31  54  47  21
1  90  54  61  52  19   4  50  19
2  97  89  12  79  98  34  89  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations and tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and aim for a fair distribution by considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 1 (98), item 2 (84), and item 3 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (90), item 2 (61), and item 6 (50).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 (97), item 4 (98), and item 1 (89).

Given these preferences, we aim to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: Assigns high value to item 1 and 2, so we can give these items to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly, but Agent 2 values it even more. Instead, we can give Agent 1 items that Agent 0 and 2 value less, such as item 3 and 6.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 and 4 highly. We can assign these to Agent 2.

By following this logic, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2
2. **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 6
3. **Agent 2**: Items 0, 4, 5, and 7

This allocation tries to respect the highest values for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
