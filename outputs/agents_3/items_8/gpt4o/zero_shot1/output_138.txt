Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  72  72  16  29   3  50  18
1   8  45  24  63  80  53  62  42
2  58  48  26  74   0   6  39  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 48 26 74  0  6 39 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their total value while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items. We have 8 items and 3 agents, so each agent should receive approximately 2 to 3 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 1 and 2 (72 each).
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest value items for Agent 1 are items 4 (80) and 3 (63).
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest value items for Agent 2 are items 3 (74) and 0 (58).
   - Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the remaining items:

- Items 5 and 6 are unallocated.

4. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 5 (value of 6) to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values item 5 more than Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 6 (value of 50) to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values item 6 more than Agent 2.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations and each agent receives at least 2 items.
