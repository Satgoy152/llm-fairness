Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  12  36  16  79  88  51  33
1   5  27  55  49  29  37  57  83
2  63  35  58  57  43  98  71  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 35 58 57 43 98 71 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is balanced. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (88), 4 (79)
   - Allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 7 (83), 2 (55)
   - Allocate items 7 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (98), 6 (71)
   - Since item 5 is already allocated, next highest are 6 and 2.
   - Allocate items 6 and 0 to Agent 2.

This ensures each agent gets at least two items and no item is allocated more than once. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [6, 0]
}
```
