Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  43  47  22  78   9   4  68
1  20   4  74  83  45  51  11  49
2  91  89  80  35  29  78  48   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 43 47 22 78  9  4 68]
 [20  4 74 83 45 51 11 49]
 [91 89 80 35 29 78 48  7]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's examine the valuations for each item and decide on an allocation strategy.

Given the table:

```
Agent/Item    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0             77  43  47  22  78   9   4  68
1             20   4  74  83  45  51  11  49
2             91  89  80  35  29  78  48   7
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 4 (value 78) is highly valued by Agent 0.
   - Item 0 (value 77) is also highly valued by Agent 0.
   - Item 7 (value 68) is next in value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 (value 83) is highly valued by Agent 1.
   - Item 2 (value 74) is the next highest value for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1 (value 89) is the highest value for Agent 2.
   - Item 5 (value 78) is also highly valued by Agent 2.
   - Item 6 (value 48) is the next in line for Agent 2.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 5, 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items with high valuations according to their preferences.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation uses all 8 items and aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
