Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  55  13  11  84  11  43  20
1   7  18  97  28  65  27  45  82
2  38  89  54  37  37  85  37  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 4 55 13 11 84 11 43 20]
 [ 7 18 97 28 65 27 45 82]
 [38 89 54 37 37 85 37 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can use the valuations to guide our allocation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Make sure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Ensure a total of 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (38).
- Item 1: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (89).
- Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (97).
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (28).
- Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (84).
- Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (85).
- Item 6: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (45).
- Item 7: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (86).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (84) — to ensure Agent 0 gets at least one item.
- Agent 1: Items 2 (97), 3 (28), 6 (45) — these are the highest values for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Items 0 (38), 1 (89), 5 (85), 7 (86) — these are the highest values for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
