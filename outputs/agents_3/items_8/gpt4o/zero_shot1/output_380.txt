Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  39  37   7  78  75  95  96
1  17  54  64  80  59  38   2  46
2  42  52  15  63  12  29  55  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's first consider the valuations given in the table and aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a balanced set of items based on their preferences.

The valuations table is as follows:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 96 | 39 | 37 | 7  | 78 | 75 | 95 | 96 |
| 1            | 17 | 54 | 64 | 80 | 59 | 38 | 2  | 46 |
| 2            | 42 | 52 | 15 | 63 | 12 | 29 | 55 | 61 |

We'll allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. 

First, let's determine a fair way of distributing the items:

1. Agent 0 values items 0, 6, and 7 highly.
2. Agent 1 values items 3, 2, and 1 highly.
3. Agent 2 values items 3, 7, and 6 highly.

To ensure fairness, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Allocate items in such a way that each agent gets at least some high-valued items according to their preference.
  
Based on the above observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7 (high value for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 2 (high value for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Items 6, 1, 5, 4 (balance the remaining items and value for agent 2)

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [6, 1, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least 2 items, and it distributes the items according to each agent's preferences as closely as possible.
