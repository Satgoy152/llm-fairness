Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  73  86  73  34  28  39  47
1  88  51  31  95  83  36  59  42
2   1  61  37  23   6  56  79  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach in such problems is to maximize the total value for each agent or to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly. Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 
2. If a conflict arises (i.e., two agents value an item equally), try to distribute items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (88).
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (73).
- Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (86).
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (95).
- Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (83).
- Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (56).
- Item 6: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (79).
- Item 7: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (47).

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Each agent can receive around 2-3 items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```
