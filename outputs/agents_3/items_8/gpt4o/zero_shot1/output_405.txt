Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  59  58  26  77  67   0  40
1  85  19   3  60  24  92  78  91
2  66  92   7  78  85  24  42  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 85 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 92 (highest)
   - Assign to Agent 2

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 3
   - Agent 2 values it at 7
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 60 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Assign to Agent 2

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 24
   - Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest)
   - Assign to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 92 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Assign to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 78 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 42
   - Assign to Agent 1

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, ensuring all items are allocated fairly according to the given values.
