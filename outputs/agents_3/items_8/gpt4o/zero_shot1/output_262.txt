Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  34   2  51   2  51  95  24
1  40   4  54  56  60  77  99  86
2  59  98  82   3  26  37  48  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we could try to maximize the total valuation of items for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the valuations provided, I will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to assign items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 7.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 0 (value 49)
   - Item 3 (value 51)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 4 (value 60)
   - Item 5 (value 77)
   - Item 6 (value 99)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 1 (value 98)
   - Item 2 (value 82)
   - Item 7 (value 98)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
