Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  83  85  68  80
1  30  38  81  24  86
2  78  17  35  35  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 38 81 24 86]
 [78 17 35 35 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest valued items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [79, 83, 85, 68, 80]
- Agent 1 values: [30, 38, 81, 24, 86]
- Agent 2 values: [78, 17, 35, 35, 88]

We aim to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item whenever possible.

1. **Assign item 4 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 88.
2. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 81.
3. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 79.
4. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the next highest valuation at 83 for item 1.
5. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: Although Agent 1 values item 3 the least, it balances the number of items between agents, and Agent 1 already has a high-priority item.

Based on this allocation, each agent receives the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items close to their highest preferences while distributing the total number of items fairly.
