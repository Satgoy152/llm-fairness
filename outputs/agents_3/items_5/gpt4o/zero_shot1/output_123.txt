Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  84  49  84  18
1  33  61  10  37   3
2  24  98  28  94  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 61 10 37  3]
 [24 98 28 94 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and only integer numbers of items are assigned.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [71, 84, 49, 84, 18]
- Agent 1: [33, 61, 10, 37, 3]
- Agent 2: [24, 98, 28, 94, 95]

Here's a potential allocation approach:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest at 98.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it at 71.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the same as item 1 at 84, and no one else values it higher.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it at 95, the highest.
5. Lastly, assign item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the least out of their options, but it's the only item left.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total valuation.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
