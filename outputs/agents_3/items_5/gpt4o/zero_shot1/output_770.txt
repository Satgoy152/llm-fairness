Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  19   3  88  40
1  79  42  84  74  97
2  91  17  78  86  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's assess the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 19.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above assessments:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3 (values: 19 and 88)
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4 (values: 84 and 97)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value: 91)

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
