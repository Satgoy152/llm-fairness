Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  96  57  37  63
1  29  15  45  51  65
2   9  72   7  78  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 15 45 51 65]
 [ 9 72  7 78 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    Item
    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  96  57  37  63
1  29  15  45  51  65
2   9  72   7  78  18
```

To make the allocation, we will consider the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuations for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 1** has higher valuations for items 2 and 4 compared to Agent 2.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives us the following:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
