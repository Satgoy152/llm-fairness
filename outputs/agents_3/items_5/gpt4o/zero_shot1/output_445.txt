Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  82  45  35  54
1  40  30  85   2  40
2  46  23  42  26  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items and try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can use the "maximum weight matching" approach in a bipartite graph to achieve this.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Check the highest value each agent assigns to an item and try to allocate that item to that agent.
2. Ensure all agents are allocated at least one item.
3. Ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's go through the valuations and allocate items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.

We can allocate based on these high valuations while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 83).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 85).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 70).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 can go to Agent 0 (value 82).
- Item 3 can go to Agent 2 (value 26).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
