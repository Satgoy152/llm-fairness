Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  73  92  72   5
1  80  74  28  37   2
2  65  24  26  14  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can start by examining the values each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute them so that the allocations are fair and balanced.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [26, 73, 92, 72, 5]
- Agent 1 values: [80, 74, 28, 37, 2]
- Agent 2 values: [65, 24, 26, 14, 77]

We can start by assigning items based on the highest values each agent places on the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 92.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 80.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 77.

Now we have allocated items 0, 2, and 4. We need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3:

- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 74, and Agent 2 at 24. The highest value is 74 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 37, and Agent 2 at 14. The highest value is 72 by Agent 0.

Thus, the proposed allocations based on valuations are:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 2: Item 4

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
