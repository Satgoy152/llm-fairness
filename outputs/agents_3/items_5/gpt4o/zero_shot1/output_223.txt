Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  29  36  69  70
1  32  32  41  31  51
2  38  29  11  30  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents, we can use the approach of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here, we'll aim to assign items such that every agent receives a fair share of the total value they could potentially achieve.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuations overall.
- Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations but still significant for certain items.
- Agent 2 generally has the lowest valuations across the board.

Considering these observations, we can attempt a fair allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has a very high valuation for item 0 (98). Assigning item 0 to Agent 0 maximizes the overall valuation.
2. **Agent 0** also values item 3 quite highly (69). Let's assign item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (41) among their valuations. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 1** also has a good valuation for item 4 (51). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 2** will receive item 1, as they have equal valuation (29) as Agent 0 for this item, and Agent 1 values it relatively lowly.

The allocations will thus be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation preferences.
