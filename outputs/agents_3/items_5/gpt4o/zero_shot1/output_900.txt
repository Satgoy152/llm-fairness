Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  64  21  13  27
1  16  36  78  42  14
2  64  78  60  45  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of agents based on their valuations. We will evaluate the possible allocations to see which one provides a fair distribution of items based on their values.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high value for item 1.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 4.

Now, we allocate based on maximizing the satisfaction for each agent:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we have to allocate the remaining items (0 and 3):

- Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2.
- Item 3 can be given to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already has a high-value item.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is based on relatively high valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
