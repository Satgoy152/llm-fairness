Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  93  89  81  63
1  13  79  29  41  44
2  99  59  61  39  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, let's aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will assign items in a way that provides the highest possible value sum for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations, but no extremely high preferences.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most significantly, and also has moderate valuations for items 2 and 4.

Given these observations, we can make the following allocations:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values item 1 the most).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values item 2 highly, after item 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values item 3 higher than other items).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 4 than other agents).

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
