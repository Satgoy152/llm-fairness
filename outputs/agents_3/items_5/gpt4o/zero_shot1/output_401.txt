Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  84  45  46   4
1  27  27  82  43  89
2  31   2  34  70  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2) based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value = 66
   - Item 1: Value = 84
   - Item 2: Value = 45
   - Item 3: Value = 46
   - Item 4: Value = 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: Value = 27
   - Item 1: Value = 27
   - Item 2: Value = 82
   - Item 3: Value = 43
   - Item 4: Value = 89

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: Value = 31
   - Item 1: Value = 2
   - Item 2: Value = 34
   - Item 3: Value = 70
   - Item 4: Value = 49

Based on the valuations, we aim to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with 66.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 84.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with 82.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with 70.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with 89.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4
- Agent 2 receives item: 3

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
