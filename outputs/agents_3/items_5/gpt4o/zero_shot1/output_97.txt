Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  30  53  69  98
1  80  25  14  58  96
2  50  58  89  46   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation. Here, we will try to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction (total sum of valuations) is maximized while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [23, 30, 53, 69, 98]
- Agent 1: [80, 25, 14, 58, 96]
- Agent 2: [50, 58, 89, 46, 4]

A possible allocation strategy could involve giving each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's review the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (80)
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (58)
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (89)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (69)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (98)

Based on this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4
- Agent 1 receives item 0
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2

Allocating the items this way ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, leading to a fair distribution of the available items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
