Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  15  61  79  26
1  98  23  21  75  26
2  88  31  29  92  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total utility or value that each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (Value 79)
   - Next highest value: Item 2 (Value 61)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (Value 98)
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (Value 75)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (Value 92)
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (Value 88)

Given the constraints of ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we could allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 2
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 1, 4

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and maximizes the value each agent receives from their allocated items.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This ensures all 5 items are allocated and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations.
