Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  30   2  91  93
1  92  46  95  54   5
2  75  98  73  18  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [75 98 73 18 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 4 at 93, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 1 at 98, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 2 at 95, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 0 at 92, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 3 at 91, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation and assigns all items fairly to the agents. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
