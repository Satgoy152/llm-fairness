Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87   3  73  83  35
1  97  74  49  70  54
2  65   8  31  42  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87  3 73 83 35]
 [97 74 49 70 54]
 [65  8 31 42 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We'll try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual values.

Given the valuations table:
```
Agent 0: [87, 3, 73, 83, 35]
Agent 1: [97, 74, 49, 70, 54]
Agent 2: [65, 8, 31, 42, 29]
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 97.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 74.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 73.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 83.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 54.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

Now let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing total satisfaction across all agents.
