Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  37  41  30  72
1   5  32  42  54  12
2  34  56  50  40  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 32 42 54 12]
 [34 56 50 40 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the total valuation score each agent receives based on their preferences. We aim to maximize the overall satisfaction and distribute the items in a way that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged. 

Let's consider the valuations provided:
- Agent 0 values are: [66, 37, 41, 30, 72]
- Agent 1 values are: [5, 32, 42, 54, 12]
- Agent 2 values are: [34, 56, 50, 40, 64]

To achieve a fair distribution, we'll try to allocate the items by matching each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and only 5 items are allocated in total.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 66.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 56.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 50.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 54.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 4].
- Agent 1 gets item [3].
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 2].

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
