Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  74  83  65  72
1  97  56  85  50  28
2  95  45  32  51   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [74, 74, 83, 65, 72]
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 83)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [97, 56, 85, 50, 28]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 97)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [95, 45, 32, 51, 1]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 95)

Now, let's proceed to allocate items ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and we maximize their satisfaction.

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value (97) for them.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value (83) for them.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 because it's the highest available for them after Item 0 (value 51).

Now, we have 2 items left (Items 1 and 4), and we need to allocate them among the agents:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 74) because it increases their total value significantly.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 28) as it's the highest remaining value for them.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their individual utilities from the remaining options, and all items are distributed.
