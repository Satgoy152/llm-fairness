Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  45  77  34  76
1  10  10  60   9  53
2  33  51  82  91  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 2 the most (77), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 4 the most (53), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Item 3 the most (91), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. For remaining items (0 and 1), we aim to balance the allocations based on remaining values:
   - Agent 0 has remaining high value for item 4 (76), but since it's already taken by agent 1, we check item 1 (45).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 with a decent value (33), but item 1 is more valuable (51).

Considering these, a balanced allocation can be:
- Give item 1 to agent 0, since it's their second highest remaining value.
- Give item 0 to agent 2, since it balances the distribution with their existing allocation.

Thus, each agent gets a fair share based on the values they assigned to the items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
