Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  17  77  31  65
1  43  67  17   3  50
2  98  22  86  83  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to distribute the items to maximize total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item or as evenly as possible.

Let's examine the values:

- Agent 0 values: [45, 17, 77, 31, 65]
- Agent 1 values: [43, 67, 17, 3, 50]
- Agent 2 values: [98, 22, 86, 83, 90]

One approach is to allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations to ensure each agent gets the items they value most. Let's try to allocate items such that no agent is left out and the allocation is as fair as possible:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (98), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
2. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (77), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (67), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
4. For item 3, agent 2 values it highly (83), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
5. For item 4, agent 2 has the highest valuation (90), but to ensure some balance, let's allocate item 4 to agent 1 who values it at 50.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is fairly balanced based on their valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
