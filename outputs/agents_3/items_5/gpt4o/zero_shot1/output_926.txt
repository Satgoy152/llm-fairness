Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  57  46  31  34
1  34  36  31   6  69
2  58  62  85  13  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We have 5 items and 3 agents, so at least one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (57), 2 (46), 0 (42)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (69), 1 (36), 0 (34)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (85), 1 (62), 0 (58)

To ensure fairness, we should try to match agents with their most valued items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (least value for Agent 0, but it ensures each agent gets a fair share).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]

Presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
