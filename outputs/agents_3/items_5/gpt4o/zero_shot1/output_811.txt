Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  15  76   7  33
1  12  96  91  58  26
2  37  42  86   7  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value across all agents. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 37.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 96.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 91.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 58.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 33.

Based on this strategy, here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
