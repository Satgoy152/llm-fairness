Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  65  31  98  20
1  35  30  41  56  67
2  67  92  55  56  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we need to find a way to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize their satisfaction.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item for fairness, if possible.

Let's see the valuations:
- Agent 0: [5, 65, 31, 98, 20]
- Agent 1: [35, 30, 41, 56, 67]
- Agent 2: [67, 92, 55, 56, 29]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 3 (value 98), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 4 (value 67), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 1 (value 92), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 3, and 4. Let's allocate the remaining items 0 and 2:

4. **Remaining items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest (value 67), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (value 41), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent has an integer number of items.
