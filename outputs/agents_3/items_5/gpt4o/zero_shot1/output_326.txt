Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1   9  50  47  99
1  16  33  93  61  91
2  83  56  54  46  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Find the most valued items for each agent:**

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (83).

2. **Assign these most valued items to each agent first:**

   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
   
   - Agent 0 values item 3 (47) higher than item 1 (9).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (61) higher than item 1 (33).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 (56) higher than item 3 (46).

   Given the above preferences, allocate:
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1 (since it increases their total value significantly).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total value based on the agents' preferences.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
