Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  22  81  42  84
1  94  37  63  27  38
2  22  42  73  81  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [22 42 73 81 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [33, 22, 81, 42, 84]
- Agent 1: [94, 37, 63, 27, 38]
- Agent 2: [22, 42, 73, 81, 82]

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

**Step 1:** Assign the highest value item for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values Item 4 (84).
- Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (94).
- Agent 2 highly values Item 3 (81).

**Step 2:** Allocate the remaining items:

After the first step, Items 1 and 2 remain unallocated. Let's assign these based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 2: Highest remaining value by Agent 0 (81).
- Item 1: Highest remaining value by Agent 2 (42).

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 gets Items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and the total number of items allocated is five.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
