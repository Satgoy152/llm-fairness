Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  19  22  44  75
1  80  85  42  11  52
2  53  47  59  81  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will look for a distribution that maximizes each agent's valuation, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated.

Let's consider the maximum value each agent has for any item and try to distribute based on those.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is on item 4 (value = 75).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is on item 1 (value = 85).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is on item 3 (value = 81).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 3, and 4. We still have to allocate items 0 and 2.

4. **Unallocated Items:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 1 (value = 80).
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

   - Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 2 (value = 59).
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
