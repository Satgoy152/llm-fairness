Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  43  22  38  98
1  61  92  13  81  99
2  55  70  16  62  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total utility or value each agent receives. A common method for achieving a fair allocation is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" approach, which is similar to the assignment problem in optimization. Here's how we can proceed with this example:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (98), 1 (43), 3 (38), 0 (29), 2 (22)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (99), 1 (92), 3 (81), 0 (61), 2 (13)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (93), 1 (70), 3 (62), 0 (55), 2 (16)

By examining the values, we can make the following allocations:

- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (99). So, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (92). So, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most (81). However, since Agent 1 already has two items, consider Agent 2 who values it second most (62). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (61), but since Agent 1 has two items, consider Agent 2 who values it second most (55). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (22). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
