Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  89  78  65  20
1  59  85  94  36  19
2  98  19  59  77  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here’s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 89. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 94. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 98. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated three items and need to allocate two more. We will look for the next highest valuations:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - The next highest unallocated item for Agent 0 is item 2 with a value of 78, but it’s already allocated. So we consider item 3 with a value of 65. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 2**:
   - The next highest unallocated item for Agent 2 is item 4 with a value of 92. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
