Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87   1  22  48   2
1  20  76  35  60  79
2  43  80  30  17  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 76 35 60 79]
 [43 80 30 17 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We will try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 87, 1, 22, 48, 2
Agent 1: 20, 76, 35, 60, 79
Agent 2: 43, 80, 30, 17, 67
```

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 87.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 80.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 35.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest at 60.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.

Using this strategy, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
