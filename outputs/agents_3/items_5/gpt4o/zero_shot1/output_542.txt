Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  62  77  76  25
1  58   9  45  75  22
2  44  33  65  75  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering the valuations of the agents, let's aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the individual satisfaction of each agent as much as possible. We can follow a simple method to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the total value across all items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 60, 62, 77, 76, 25
- Agent 1: 58, 9, 45, 75, 22
- Agent 2: 44, 33, 65, 75, 77

One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the highest:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 at 58, and Agent 2 at 44. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 9, and Agent 2 at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 45, and Agent 2 at 65. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 75, and Agent 2 at 75. Assign to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest cumulative value).
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 22, and Agent 2 at 77. Assign to Agent 2.

Now let's check if this distribution is fair and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has received items 0, 1, 2, 3.
- Agent 1 has received no items.
- Agent 2 has received item 4.

Since Agent 0 has too many items, we need to redistribute to ensure fairness.

Redistributing:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is more balanced.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
