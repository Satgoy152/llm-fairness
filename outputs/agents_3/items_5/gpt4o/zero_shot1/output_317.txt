Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  50   1  16  43
1  97  58  75  19  27
2  95  10  62  75  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocating the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** `[69, 50, 1, 16, 43]`
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** `[97, 58, 75, 19, 27]`
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** `[95, 10, 62, 75, 95]`

We can use a greedy approach to distribute items based on the highest marginal increase in total valuation across agents.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0: 69
   - Agent 1: 97
   - Agent 2: 95
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 50
   - Agent 1: 58
   - Agent 2: 10
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 1
   - Agent 1: 75
   - Agent 2: 62
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 16
   - Agent 1: 19
   - Agent 2: 75
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 43
   - Agent 1: 27
   - Agent 2: 95
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

### Final Allocation:
Agent 0 receives no items, Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2, and Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
