Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  59  72  82   1
1  54  42  30  99  88
2  26  64  88   6  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible, considering the constraint of having only 5 items). Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (82).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99), but since we want to distribute items fairly, we will consider other items based on their values.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (98).

Now, let's look at the remaining items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (66).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 has a significant valuation (64).
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (88).

Considering these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, and 4

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the items are allocated in a way that respects the highest valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
