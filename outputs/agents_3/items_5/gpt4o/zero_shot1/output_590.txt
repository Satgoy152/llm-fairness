Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  87  27  43  31
1  68  59  18  98   0
2  49   7  12  84  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as high as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 68
- Item 1: 87
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 43
- Item 4: 31

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 68
- Item 1: 59
- Item 2: 18
- Item 3: 98
- Item 4: 0

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 7
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 84
- Item 4: 24

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items to the agent who values them the most. Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 68, but to balance the allocation, we can assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 27.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it more than the others at 24.

Based on this allocation strategy, the assignment is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items that maximize their total valuation.
