Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  10  55  77  74
1  80  14  72  84  78
2  51  32  84  70  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize each agent's value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One such approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values item 3 at 77, which is their highest available valuation.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values item 2 at 55, which is their second-highest available valuation.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values item 0 at 80, which is their highest available valuation.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values item 4 at 78, which is their second-highest available valuation.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values item 1 at 32, which is their highest remaining valuation after other allocations.

This allocation ensures that all agents receive an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
