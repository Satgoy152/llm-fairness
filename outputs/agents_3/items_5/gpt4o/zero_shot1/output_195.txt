Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  56  56  78  75
1  78  78  58  11  11
2  31  54  22  36   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation each agent receives. We should consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1, but their valuations are generally lower than those of agents 0 and 1.

Let's try to allocate items by prioritizing the highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 3 (valuation 78, highest among all agents for this item)
  - Item 4 (valuation 75, highest among all agents for this item)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 0 (valuation 78, same as Agent 0, but Agent 1's next best option is a lower valuation)
  - Item 1 (valuation 78, highest among all agents for this item)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 2 (valuation 22; other items are allocated, and this is reasonably fair given the remaining options)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and ensures all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
