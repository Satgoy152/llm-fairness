Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  75  48  62  14
1  33  89  17  15   7
2  68  59  39  81  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. We will allocate the items by considering the highest valuations for each item and ensuring a balanced distribution among agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 68 for item 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 89 for item 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 48 for item 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 81 for item 3.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 14 for item 4.

After considering these allocations, the distribution would be:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuations are maximized.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
