Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  38  23  46  79
1  61  66  38  25  91
2  79  97  43  11  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation method:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation item: Item 0 (Value 89)
   - Second highest valuation item: Item 4 (Value 79)
   - Allocated items: [0, 4]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation item: Item 4 (Value 91)
   - Second highest valuation item: Item 1 (Value 66)
   - Allocated items: [1]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation item: Item 1 (Value 97)
   - Second highest valuation item: Item 2 (Value 43)
   - Allocated items: [2, 3]

Let's now allocate the items, ensuring each agent ends up with an item and no item is allocated more than once:

Given this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

Now, let's represent the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item and all items are distributed fairly based on the valuations provided.
