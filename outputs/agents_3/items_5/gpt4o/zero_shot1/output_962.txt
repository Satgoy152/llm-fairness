Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  56  22  32  86
1  77   2  74  82  80
2  87  56  88  92  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Make sure each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 87, so assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 56, but Agent 2 already has an item. Assign it to Agent 0 to spread allocations.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 88, so assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 92, so assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 86, but Agent 0 already has an item. Assign it to Agent 1 to spread allocations.

Now, checking the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items [1].
- Agent 1 has items [4].
- Agent 2 has items [0, 2, 3].

All items are distributed, and each agent has an integer number of items. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
