Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  93  19   4  72
1  77  22   2  44  14
2  23   0   8  70  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 22  2 44 14]
 [23  0  8 70 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most.

Let's analyze the table and assign items:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 23
   - Assign to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 93
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 0
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Agent 2 values it at 8
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - Assign to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.

Now, let's compile the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
