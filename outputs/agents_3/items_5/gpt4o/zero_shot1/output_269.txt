Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  78  83  80  67
1  39  40  77  96  16
2  63  68  58   1  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [63 68 58  1 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: [53, 78, 83, 80, 67]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [39, 40, 77, 96, 16]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [63, 68, 58, 1, 50]

A possible approach is to first assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

- Item 2 has the highest valuation by Agent 0: 83
- Item 3 has the highest valuation by Agent 1: 96
- Item 1 has the highest valuation by Agent 2: 68

Now we have allocated items 2, 3, and 1. We will allocate the remaining items 0 and 4:

- Item 0 has the highest remaining valuation by Agent 2: 63
- Item 4 has the highest remaining valuation by Agent 0: 67

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]

The JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
