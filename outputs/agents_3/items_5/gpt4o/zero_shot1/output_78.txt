Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  83  84  39  50
1  89  11  52  98  20
2  13  31  33  75  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: 91, 83, 84, 39, 50
- Agent 1: 89, 11, 52, 98, 20
- Agent 2: 13, 31, 33, 75, 46

One way to approach this is to allocate items based on which agent values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 46 (as Agent 0 already has 3 items and Agent 1 has 1 item, it's fair to give this item to Agent 2).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's how it looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
