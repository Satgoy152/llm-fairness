Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  45   0  86  48
1  49  69  30  39  65
2  49  61   9   0  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, if possible, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

Agent 0 values item 3 the most (86), so we'll assign item 3 to agent 0.

Agent 1 values item 1 the most (69), so we'll assign item 1 to agent 1.

Agent 2 values item 4 the most (66), so we'll assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now we have items 0 and 2 unallocated.

Item 0: 
- Agent 1 and Agent 2 both value it equally (49), but since Agent 1 has only one item so far, we'll assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Item 2:
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most among the three agents (30). Since Agent 1 has the capacity to take another item, we'll assign item 2 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations.
