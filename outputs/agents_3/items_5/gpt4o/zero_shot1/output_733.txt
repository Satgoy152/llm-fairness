Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96   4  93  96  30
1  83  41  12  61  43
2  81   1  34  70  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 41 12 61 43]
 [81  1 34 70 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their total value. One such approach is to use a greedy allocation strategy where we allocate items based on the highest valuation first.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 30

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 61
  - Item 4: 43

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 77

Let's find the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (96) and Item 3 (96).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (41).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (77).
4. The remaining Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 0, who values it at 93.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 2, Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4

The JSON format for the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
