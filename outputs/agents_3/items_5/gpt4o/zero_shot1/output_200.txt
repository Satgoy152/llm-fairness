Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  79  72  23  83
1  24  72  34  78  49
2  46   1  51  73   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their respective valuations, we'll analyze the table and distribute the items accordingly. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a decent valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has a good valuation for item 3, but not as high as Agent 1.

Considering these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation at 90).
- **Item 1:** Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation at 79).
- **Item 2:** Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation at 72).
- **Item 3:** Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation at 78).
- **Item 4:** Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation at 83).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing overall satisfaction.
