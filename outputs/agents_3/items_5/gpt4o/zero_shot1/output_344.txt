Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  41  75  80   2
1  18  37  15  28  36
2  52  28  53  11  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Ideally, each agent should receive items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has moderate valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.

Considering these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly (75).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly (80).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it highly (83).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because it has a moderate value for Agent 1 (37).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it highly (52).

This allocation gives each agent a considerable portion of their high-valued items.

The JSON format of this allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 5 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item based on their valuations.
