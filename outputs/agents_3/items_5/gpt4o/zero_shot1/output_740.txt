Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  61  94  80  51
1  80  20  56  16  16
2  16  10  76  57  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for each item. Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (94)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 3 (80)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 0 (79)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (80)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 2 (56)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 1 (20)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (76)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 3 (57)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 4 (25)

Let's allocate based on these valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total allocation does not exceed 5 items:

- **Step 1**: Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 because it has the highest valuation overall.
- **Step 2**: Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valuation.
- **Step 3**: Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 as it's their next highest valuation and no one else values it as highly.
- **Step 4**: Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2, giving them at least one item and based on their third highest valuation.
- **Step 5**: Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it gives them the highest total valuation.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction by considering each agent's preferences and ensures that each agent receives an item.
