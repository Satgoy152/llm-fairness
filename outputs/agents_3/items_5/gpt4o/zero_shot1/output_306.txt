Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  42  81  48  69
1  85  46  15  71  45
2  45  59  17  49  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation of items for each agent or ensuring that each agent receives items according to their preferences. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent. Here, we will aim to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible, given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 37, 42, 81, 48, 69
- Agent 1: 85, 46, 15, 71, 45
- Agent 2: 45, 59, 17, 49, 74

One possible allocation strategy is to find a combination where each agent has a balanced share of the total value:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 81) - highest value for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 85) - highest value for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 74) - highest value for Agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 71) - second-highest value for Agent 1.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 42) - second-highest value for Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and maximizes the total value for each agent.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
