Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  40  53  97  82
1  72  66  38  49  15
2  46  94  59  83  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items to the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's explore an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.

Given the constraints, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

This doesn't yet allocate all items, so we need to allocate the remaining item 2. Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 2 than Agent 1, so it makes sense to allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
