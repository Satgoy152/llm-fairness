Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  73  31  10  66
1  40  80  38  96  25
2  84  35  96  33  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [14, 73, 31, 10, 66]
- Agent 1 values: [40, 80, 38, 96, 25]
- Agent 2 values: [84, 35, 96, 33, 50]

We will allocate items in a manner that maximizes the total value for each agent.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for Agent 0: Item 1 (73)
   - Next highest value: Item 4 (66)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for Agent 1: Item 3 (96)
   - Next highest value: Item 1 (80) - already allocated to Agent 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for Agent 2: Item 2 (96)
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (84)

### Allocated Items:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 0

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items allocated is 5.
