Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  95  22  31  96
1  90  83  98  96   7
2  63  17  14   1  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value received by all agents, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here’s one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly (96), so they should receive item 4.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (98) and item 3 (96). Agent 1 should receive item 2 and item 3.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 can receive item 0, which has a relatively high value of 63 for them.

4. **Remaining item**:
   - Item 1 is left, which agent 0 values at 95, higher than any other agent’s valuation for this item. Therefore, item 1 should go to agent 0.

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuations are reasonably balanced.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 5, satisfying all the given conditions.
