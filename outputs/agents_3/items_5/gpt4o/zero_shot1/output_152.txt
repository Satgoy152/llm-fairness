Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  56  48  37  45
1  70  17  61  26  56
2  71  25  79  92  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the agents' valuations for each item and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the agents and their valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 56
- Item 2: 48
- Item 3: 37
- Item 4: 45

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 17
- Item 2: 61
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 56

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 71
- Item 1: 25
- Item 2: 79
- Item 3: 92
- Item 4: 58

Let's start by allocating items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest at 71.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 56.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it highest at 79.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 92.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 56.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 4.
- Agent 2 gets Items 0, 2, and 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
