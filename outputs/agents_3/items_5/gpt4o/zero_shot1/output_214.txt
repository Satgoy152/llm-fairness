Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  74  63  51  89
1  23  15  41  24  89
2  10  61  85  39  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [10 61 85 39 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [24, 74, 63, 51, 89]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [23, 15, 41, 24, 89]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [10, 61, 85, 39, 50]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 23, Agent 2 at 10. 
  - Highest value by Agent 0.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 15, Agent 2 at 61. 
  - Highest value by Agent 0.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 at 41, Agent 2 at 85. 
  - Highest value by Agent 2.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 24, Agent 2 at 39. 
  - Highest value by Agent 0.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 89, Agent 2 at 50. 
  - Highest value shared by Agent 0 and Agent 1, but since Agent 0 already has multiple items, we will assign it to Agent 1.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
