Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  15  72  52  39
1  27  60  24  57  56
2  64  51  94  92  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items, we can consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The objective is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest, so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, so we can allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items and need to allocate 2 more. We'll aim to balance the allocations by checking the remaining highest values:

- Agent 0 can take item 3, as it has a relatively high valuation from them among the unallocated items.
- Agent 1 can take item 0, as it has a higher valuation than Agent 2 for this item.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair portion based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```
