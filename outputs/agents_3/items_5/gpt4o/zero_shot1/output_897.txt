Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  96   3   1  18
1  19  18  54  81  46
2  56  38   7  69  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [56 38  7 69 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for the items and aim to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for item 1 (96), so assign item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuation for item 3 (81), so assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation for item 0 (56), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
   - Also has a relatively high value for item 4 (36), so assign item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining item**:
   - Item 2 has not been allocated. Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (54), so assign item 2 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned while maximizing the agents' valuations in a balanced manner.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
