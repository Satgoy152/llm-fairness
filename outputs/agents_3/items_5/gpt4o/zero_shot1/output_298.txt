Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  28  11  14   2
1  71  65  10  75  49
2  49  17  20  86  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use the following method to achieve this:

1. Evaluate the value each agent has for each item and try to allocate items to agents to maximize their total satisfaction.
2. Ensure that every agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 31.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 75.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 97.

From these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now, we have two items left: item 1 and item 2. We should allocate these remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction:

- Agent 1 values item 1 at 65, which is the highest remaining value.
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 11, which is higher than agent 1's value of 10 and agent 2's value of 20.

Thus, allocate:
- Item 1 to agent 1.
- Item 2 to agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and maximizes the agents' total valuations.
