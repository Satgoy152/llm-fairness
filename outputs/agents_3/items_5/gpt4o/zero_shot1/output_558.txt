Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  15  31  52  17
1  20  67  73  38  64
2  41  17  48  69  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. We'll consider a simple approach to balance the allocations based on the valuations provided.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 41.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 67.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 73.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 52.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 38.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations for those items, and all items are allocated.

    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
