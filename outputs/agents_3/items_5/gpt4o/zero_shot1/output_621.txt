Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  73  90  32  55
1  39  72  41  76  10
2  87  91  91  10  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [87 91 91 10 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 5 items and 3 agents, so one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's evaluate a fair allocation based on maximizing the total valuations for agents:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 48
   - Item 1: 73
   - Item 2: 90
   - Item 3: 32
   - Item 4: 55

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 39
   - Item 1: 72
   - Item 2: 41
   - Item 3: 76
   - Item 4: 10

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 91
   - Item 2: 91
   - Item 3: 10
   - Item 4: 39

A potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (value 90).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 76).
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1 (values 87 and 91).
- Remaining item 4 can be allocated to Agent 0 (value 55).

This allocation maximizes the sum of values each agent receives while fulfilling the requirement that only 5 items are allocated.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
