Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  52   9  90  26
1  56  40  46  99  38
2  75  88  75  99  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [56 40 46 99 38]
 [75 88 75 99 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets the items they value the most while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's examine the valuations and assign the items accordingly.

### Valuation Table Recap:
- **Agent 0**: [7, 52, 9, 90, 26]
- **Agent 1**: [56, 40, 46, 99, 38]
- **Agent 2**: [75, 88, 75, 99, 75]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 99).
2. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 75).
3. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 88).
4. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 56).
5. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 9).

### Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

This allocation considers the highest value for each agent and ensures all items are distributed fairly.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
