Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  69  14  75   7
1  59  72  13  61  28
2  42  48  44  88  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their perceived value, while also ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. We can aim for a fair distribution of total value among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0: Value = 69
   - Item 1: Value = 69
   - Total Value = 69 + 69 = 138

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 4: Value = 28
   - Total Value = 28

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value = 44
   - Item 3: Value = 88
   - Total Value = 44 + 88 = 132

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
