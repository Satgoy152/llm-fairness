Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  37  95  95  72
1  12  40  47   6  46
2  19  73   2   5  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [19 73  2  5 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into consideration their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, or ensure the allocation is sensibly balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items as [67, 37, 95, 95, 72]
- Agent 1: Values items as [12, 40, 47, 6, 46]
- Agent 2: Values items as [19, 73, 2, 5, 98]

A fair allocation strategy could be to assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for items 2 and 3 (value: 95). We'll assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (value: 47), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 1 (value: 40). We'll assign item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (value: 98). We'll assign item 4.

Now, items 0 and 3 are left. We should distribute them to balance the allocations:

4. Assign item 3 to **Agent 0** (next highest value after item 2).
5. Assign item 0 to **Agent 1** (next highest value after item 1).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value obtained by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
