Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  58  74  79  45
1  96  24  20  51  80
2  21  10   6  32  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent gets from their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A simple approach to this is to allocate items based on the highest value an agent has for an item, ensuring each item is allocated only once.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 3 has the highest value of 79 for agent 0.
   - Item 2 has the second highest value of 74 for agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 0 has the highest value of 96 for agent 1.
   - Item 4 has the second highest value of 80 for agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 1 has the highest value of 10 for agent 2, but since other allocations are higher, we allocate item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and maximizes the total value each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
