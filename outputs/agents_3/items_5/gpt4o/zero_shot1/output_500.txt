Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  30  33  24   4
1  53  32   1  88  40
2  13  64  23  69  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total utility for each agent by assigning items based on their preferences. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations based on the values given:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** 96, 30, 33, 24, 4
- **Agent 1's valuations:** 53, 32, 1, 88, 40
- **Agent 2's valuations:** 13, 64, 23, 69, 82

A potential strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0:** Highest value is 96 (Agent 0).
2. **Item 1:** Highest value is 64 (Agent 2).
3. **Item 2:** Highest value is 33 (Agent 0).
4. **Item 3:** Highest value is 88 (Agent 1).
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is 82 (Agent 2).

Based on this valuation, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive items based on their highest valuations, maximizing the total utility.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
