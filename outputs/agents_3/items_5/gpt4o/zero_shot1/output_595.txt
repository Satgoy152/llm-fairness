Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  69  29  29  15
1   8  51  29  56  47
2  69  38  24  59  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (38).
   - Agent 0 also values item 1 highly (69), more than other agents.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (56).
   - Agent 1 also values item 4 significantly (47).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2 (24), which is more than agent 1's valuation.

Given these observations, a reasonable allocation of the items might look like this:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 2

This allocation distributes all items, and each agent receives items that are of relatively higher value to them.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
