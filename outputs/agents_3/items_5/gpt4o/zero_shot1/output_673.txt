Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  85  92  45  17
1  30  61   6  72  94
2  38  85  34  97  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that the total value for each agent is maximized based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 92.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 94.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 97.

2. **Allocate these items to the respective agents:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate the remaining items (0 and 1):**
   - Item 0: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 30, and Agent 2 at 38.
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.
   - Item 1:
     - Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 61, and Agent 2 at 85.
     - Items 1 can be allocated to Agent 0 or Agent 2, both value it equally. To balance out the total number of items, allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 2 already has two items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 3

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
