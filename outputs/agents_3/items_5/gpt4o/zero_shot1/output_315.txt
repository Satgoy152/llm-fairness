Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  59  26  66  24
1   9  53  84  76  45
2  89  96  15  74  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The values for Agent 0 are: [14, 59, 26, 66, 24]
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for them (66).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The values for Agent 1 are: [9, 53, 84, 76, 45]
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since it has the highest value for them (84).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The values for Agent 2 are: [89, 96, 15, 74, 87]
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 since it has the highest value for them (96).

Now, we need to assign the remaining items (0 and 4):

4. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Item 0:
     - Agent 2 values this the most (89), assign it to Agent 2.
   - Item 4:
     - Agent 2 values this the most (87), assign it to Agent 2.

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their total value is maximized as much as possible while also ensuring each agent gets an item.
