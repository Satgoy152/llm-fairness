Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  20  27  97  28
1  92  51  13  68  41
2  47  22  45  82  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that all items are distributed. We aim for a distribution where each agent gets an integer number of items, and the distribution is as fair as possible in terms of valuation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly, so we can assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0, so we can assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly, so we can assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. For item 1, agent 1 values it the most, so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
5. For item 2, agent 0 and agent 2 have similar valuations, but to balance the total number of items, we assign item 2 to agent 0.

Based on this reasoning, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
