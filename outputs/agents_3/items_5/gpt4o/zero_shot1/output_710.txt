Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  57  19  53  50
1  53  85  19  48  77
2  33  94  41  65  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Assign the highest valued items first**: Each agent should receive items that maximize their own valuation, while ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

2. **Check each agent's highest value item**: For each agent, identify the item with the highest valuation and attempt to assign it to them if it's not already assigned.

3. **Reevaluate and allocate remaining items**: If conflicts arise (i.e., two agents want the same item), allocate based on the highest remaining valuation for that item, then move to the next highest valued unallocated item for the remaining agents.

Following this approach for the given table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 36     | 57     | 19     | 53     | 50     |
| 1     | 53     | 85     | 19     | 48     | 77     |
| 2     | 33     | 94     | 41     | 65     | 41     |

- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation of 94 for item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation of 85 for item 1, but it's already assigned, so we look at the next highest, which is item 4 with a valuation of 77. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation of 57 for item 1, but it's already assigned. Look at their next highest, which is item 3 with a valuation of 53. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Next highest available for **Agent 1** is item 0 with 53. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- The remaining item, item 2, is assigned to **Agent 2**, as they have a valuation of 41 for it, which is the highest among unallocated items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed in a way that maximizes the valuations for each agent.
