Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  66  15  86  24
1  81  39  22  58  80
2  22  64  56  36  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 39 22 58 80]
 [22 64 56 36 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. However, since there are only 5 items and 3 agents, at least one agent will receive 2 items. 

Let's consider the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  66  15  86  24
1  81  39  22  58  80
2  22  64  56  36  68
```

A possible allocation strategy is to give each agent their highest valued available item, and then allocate any remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (86).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (81).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (64).

This leaves items 2 and 4 to be allocated. To decide between these:

- Agent 0: Values item 4 (24) higher than item 2 (15).
- Agent 1: Values item 4 (80) higher than item 2 (22).
- Agent 2: Values item 4 (68) higher than item 2 (56).

To maximize overall satisfaction, allocate item 4 to Agent 1, who values it at 80, and item 2 to Agent 2, who values it at 56.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item, and it maximizes the total value based on the given valuations.
