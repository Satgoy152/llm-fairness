Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  90  35  38  20
1  73  87  20  39  51
2  47  26  47  12   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [47 26 47 12  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their total valuation, we can use a method that considers each agent's highest-valued items first. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 1 (value 90). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 0 (value 73). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 2 (value 47). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, the remaining items are 3 and 4.

4. For item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 39 (highest).
   - Agent 2 values it at 12.
   
   Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

5. For item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 20.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51 (highest).
   - Agent 2 values it at 3.
   
   Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [2]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
