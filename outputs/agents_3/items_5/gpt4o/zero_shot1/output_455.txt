Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  37  52  36  33
1   7  75  22  49  75
2  74  20  97  64  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total value and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method like the "maximum sum allocation" or "maximizing efficiency" approach. This involves assigning items to agents based on the highest valuations, ensuring that each item is allocated once and only once.

Let's break down the valuations and make allocations:

- Agent 0:
  - Values: [28, 37, 52, 36, 33]
- Agent 1:
  - Values: [7, 75, 22, 49, 75]
- Agent 2:
  - Values: [74, 20, 97, 64, 54]

Now, let's consider the highest value each agent has for the items:

1. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 2 (97).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 (75).
3. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (75).
4. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (74).
5. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (64).

Allocating based on the above observations:

- Agent 0: 
  - No items have the highest value for Agent 0, but to ensure fairness, Agent 0 can get item 3 (since item 3â€™s highest value was already taken by Agent 2, we will consider second highest value).
- Agent 1:
  - Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2:
  - Items 0 and 2

After allocation, we get:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is exactly five.
