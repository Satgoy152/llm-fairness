Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  80   6  70  25
1  30  37  10  58  49
2  18  82  87  60  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 0 and item 1 highly, so we should aim to allocate these to them.
2. **Agent 1**: They have a moderate valuation for item 3 and item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 2 and item 1, but since item 1 is already considered for agent 0, we focus on item 2.

Given these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2.

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent while distributing the items reasonably.

Here is the allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
