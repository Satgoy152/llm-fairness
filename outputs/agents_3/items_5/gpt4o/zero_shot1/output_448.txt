Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  27  72  28  50
1  12  12  99  68  91
2  68  38  92  91  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we should consider the valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 99 compared to others.

2. Assign item 3 to agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 91.

3. Assign item 4 to agent 1:
   - After assigning item 2, agent 1 also values item 4 highly at 91.

4. Assign item 0 to agent 2:
   - Agent 2 has a fairly high valuation for item 0 at 68.

5. Assign item 1 to agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 27, which is higher than agent 1's valuation of 12.

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items based on their preferences and all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format: 

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
