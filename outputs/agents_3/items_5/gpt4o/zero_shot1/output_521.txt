Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  56  53  15  38
1  28  26  13  26  85
2  44  17  39   4  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations, aiming to maximize the total value received by all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 3.

Based on these considerations, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for it.
- Assign items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 2, as they have relatively high valuations and ensure all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
