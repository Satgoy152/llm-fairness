Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  16   4  85  40
1  21  11  60  22  63
2  19  76  59  64  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent, ensuring each gets at least one item. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum of valuations" heuristic or other fair division approaches. Given the valuations from each agent for each item, we can attempt a fair allocation as follows:

### Step 1: List the Valuations
- Agent 0: [31, 16, 4, 85, 40]
- Agent 1: [21, 11, 60, 22, 63]
- Agent 2: [19, 76, 59, 64, 91]

### Step 2: Analyze the Optimal Assignments
- Identify the highest valuations for each agent and allocate items accordingly, ensuring no item is double-allocated.

### Step 3: Allocate Items
- Agent 0: Prefers item 3 (85)
- Agent 1: Prefers item 4 (63)
- Agent 2: Prefers item 1 (76)

Since items 3, 4, and 1 have been allocated, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 2).

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value)

### Final Allocation
The final allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the highest individual valuations per agent, ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.
