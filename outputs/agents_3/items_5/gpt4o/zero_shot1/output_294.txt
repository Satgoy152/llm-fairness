Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  10  59  78  26
1  88  42  42  29  69
2   8  58  90  65  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 58 90 65 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [8, 10, 59, 78, 26]
Agent 1: [88, 42, 42, 29, 69]
Agent 2: [8, 58, 90, 65, 77]
```

We will try to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized. The strategy is to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on an item if possible.

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 0 (78), but Agent 2 values it at 65. Since Agent 2 has the highest overall value for their top pick (90 for Item 2), it might be best to give Item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 2 (90).
3. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 1 (88).
4. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 2 (77).
5. **Item 1** has a moderate value for each but is highest for Agent 2 (58).

Considering these valuations, we try to allocate keeping the balance:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (78)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (88)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (90), Item 4 (77), Item 1 (58)

This allocation respects the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items and each item is allocated exactly once.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4, 1]
}
```
