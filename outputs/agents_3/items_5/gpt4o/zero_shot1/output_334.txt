Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  23  59  32  85
1   4  18  47  95  78
2  46   6  41  52  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate potential allocations based on the given valuations:

The valuations are as follows:
- Agent 0: [61, 23, 59, 32, 85]
- Agent 1: [4, 18, 47, 95, 78]
- Agent 2: [46, 6, 41, 52, 19]

To efficiently allocate the items, we can choose the highest-value items for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (85).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (95).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (46).

After these allocations, the remaining items are 1 and 2. Let's allocate these based on the next highest available valuations:

- For item 1, Agent 0 has a valuation of 23, Agent 1 has 18, and Agent 2 has 6. So, item 1 goes to Agent 0.
- For item 2, Agent 0 has 59, Agent 1 has 47, and Agent 2 has 41. So, item 2 goes to Agent 0.

Therefore, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
