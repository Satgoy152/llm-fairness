Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  30  82  66  74
1   5  36  91  80  40
2  61  90  96  18   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [92, 30, 82, 66, 74]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (92)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [5, 36, 91, 80, 40]
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (91)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [61, 90, 96, 18, 0]
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (96) but this is already taken. Next highest is Item 1 (90).

To allocate the items fairly:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for this agent).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for this agent).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value for this agent).

Now we have allocated 3 items, with 2 items remaining (Items 3 and 4).

- For the remaining items, consider the next highest values for each agent:
  - Agent 0: Items 3 (66) and 4 (74)
  - Agent 1: Items 3 (80) and 4 (40)
  - Agent 2: Items 3 (18) and 4 (0)

Allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
