Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  83  46  32  30
1  74  28  45   9  88
2  90  33  86  23  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" strategy, which involves assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation across all items.

Let's consider the valuations for each item and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 83
   - Agent 1 values it at 28
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Agent 2 values it at 23
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation).

Now, each agent will have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
