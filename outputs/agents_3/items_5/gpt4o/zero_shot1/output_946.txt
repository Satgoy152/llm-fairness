Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  40  13  37  71
1   0   0  63  30  21
2  42  31  62  30  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Evaluate the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the corresponding agent.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 at 0, Agent 2 at 42. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 0, Agent 2 at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 at 63, Agent 2 at 62. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 30, Agent 2 at 30. Allocate to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest cumulative valuation so far).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 21, Agent 2 at 50. Allocate to Agent 0.

However, to ensure fairness and that all agents have a chance to get items, we need to adjust:

- Give Item 2 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value for them.
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 as it has a significant value.

Revised allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
