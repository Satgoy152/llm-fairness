Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  96  26  81  36
1  68  35  45  65  57
2  68  32  22  69  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here, we aim to distribute the items such that the overall happiness (total value derived by all agents) is maximized. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Agent 1 values it at 68.
   - Agent 2 values it at 68.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** because they have the highest valuation.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Agent 2 values it at 32.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** because they have the highest valuation.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 26.
   - Agent 1 values it at 45.
   - Agent 2 values it at 22.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** because they have the highest valuation.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 81.
   - Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Agent 2 values it at 69.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** because they have the highest valuation.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Agent 1 values it at 57.
   - Agent 2 values it at 62.
   - **Assign to Agent 2** because they have the highest valuation.

Based on the above allocation, here are the results:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
