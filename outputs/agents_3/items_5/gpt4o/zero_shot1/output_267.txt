Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  65  30  49  99
1  65  90  39  20  56
2  92  14  16  97  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's follow this approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 65
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

After allocating based on the highest valuation for each item, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3

In JSON format, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
