Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  97  40  22  68
1  69  98  87  83  51
2  12  78  81  51  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is maximized or balanced as evenly as possible given the constraint of integer allocations. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 1.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuation for items 1 and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively balanced valuations but the highest for item 2.

Based on these observations, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since they value it highly.
- Assign item 0 and item 4 to Agent 1 because they provide a relatively good valuation balance.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2 as they have a good balance for these items.

This distribution aims to ensure that each agent receives items they value, while also distributing the total number of items fairly.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
