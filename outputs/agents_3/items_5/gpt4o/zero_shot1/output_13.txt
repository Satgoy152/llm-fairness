Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  76  69   9  13
1  60  78  59  77  43
2   5  96   3  21  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 5 96  3 21 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  76  69   9  13
1  60  78  59  77  43
2   5  96   3  21  45
```

We'll assess which items provide the highest value to each agent and try to fairly distribute the items.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1, followed by item 4.

### Fair Allocation

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0 (value 81)
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 3 (value 77)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 1 (value 96)
  - Item 4 (value 45)
  
Since each agent should receive at least one item, and we have 5 items to allocate, we need to assign the remaining item considering the highest remaining valuation that hasn't been allocated.

- The remaining item, 2, can go to **Agent 0** since it adds significant value (69) compared to other options.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
