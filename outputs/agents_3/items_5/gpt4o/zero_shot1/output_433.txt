Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1   9  89   5  66
1  25  28  20  67  11
2  70  99  20  33  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the items and assign them to the agents:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 70 (highest)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 28
   - Agent 2 values it at 99 (highest)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 20
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 67 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 96 (highest)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now we check the allocations to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction.
