Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  14  92  27  57
1  27   3   3  40  61
2  72   1  11  36  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent gets relative to their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for items 0, 2, and 4. 
   - Let's assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are for items 4 and 3.
   - Since item 4 is already taken, assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values are for items 4 and 0.
   - Since item 0 is already taken, assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to assign the last remaining item:

4. **Remaining Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 14.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 3.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 1.

   Since Agent 0 values it the most among the unallocated items, assign item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 5.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
