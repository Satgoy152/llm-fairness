Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  84  27  54  39
1  49  78  98  72  76
2  21  19  43  23  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve this is to use a variation of the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, but since this is a small problem, we can manually assess potential allocations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 54
- Item 4: 39

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 78
- Item 2: 98
- Item 3: 72
- Item 4: 76

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 21
- Item 1: 19
- Item 2: 43
- Item 3: 23
- Item 4: 50

To maximize fairness and satisfaction, we should try to give each agent their highest-valued items, ensuring that each item is uniquely assigned to one agent. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 with 98, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 with 84, so assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 with 50, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3 with 72, and since agent 2 already got item 4, assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 with 19, so assign item 0 to agent 0.

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
