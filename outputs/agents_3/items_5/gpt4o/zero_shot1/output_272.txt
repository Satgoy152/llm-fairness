Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  47  27  64  75
1  62   6  74  52  52
2  31  99   3   3  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Assess Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 values: [93, 47, 27, 64, 75]
   - Agent 1 values: [62, 6, 74, 52, 52]
   - Agent 2 values: [31, 99, 3, 3, 68]

2. **Assign High Value Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest value is 93 by Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 74 by Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 64 by Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Highest value is 75 by Agent 0.

3. **Fair Allocation**: 
   - Assign items primarily based on the highest valuations while ensuring balance across agents.

4. **Allocation**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 93).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 99).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 74).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 64).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 52).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their individual valuations.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes the five items fairly among the three agents, considering their valuation preferences.
