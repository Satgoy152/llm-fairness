Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  79  18   6  86
1  25  63  96  14  97
2  46  22  35  13  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we should try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [25, 79, 18, 6, 86]
- Agent 1: [25, 63, 96, 14, 97]
- Agent 2: [46, 22, 35, 13, 24]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation of 97 for item 4. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** also highly values item 2 with 96. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 with 79. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also highly values item 0 with 25 (same as Agent 1, but Agent 1 has already received two items). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** has no allocations yet, and item 3 has the highest remaining value of 13 for Agent 2. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
