Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  13  51  59  60
1  72  81   4  36  62
2  26  35  86  87  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple allocation strategy that seeks to maximize the total satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. List all item valuations for each agent.
2. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
3. Assign the item to that agent, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and no item is assigned more than once.
4. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this strategy to the given table:

Item valuations:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 72, Agent 2 at 26.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 at 81, Agent 2 at 35.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 4,  Agent 2 at 86.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 at 36, Agent 2 at 87.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 at 62, Agent 2 at 44.

Allocation:
- Item 0 is valued most by Agent 1 (72).
- Item 1 is valued most by Agent 1 (81).
- Item 2 is valued most by Agent 2 (86).
- Item 3 is valued most by Agent 2 (87).
- Item 4 is valued most by Agent 1 (62).

After considering the maximum value for each item, we aim to balance the allocations:
1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 1 already has more items, balancing the count).

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest valuations while keeping the distribution fair and balanced.
