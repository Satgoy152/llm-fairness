Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  12  17  69  45
1  38  98  16  32  76
2  11  34  58  11  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [11 34 58 11 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy to maximize total valuations and ensure fairness. Below is one such allocation:

Agent 0:
- Item 0 has the highest valuation for agent 0 (95), so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Agent 1:
- Item 1 has the highest valuation for agent 1 (98), so it makes sense to allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Item 4 also has a relatively high valuation for agent 1 (76), so it is sensible to allocate item 4 to agent 1.

Agent 2:
- Item 2 has the highest valuation for agent 2 (58), so it makes sense to allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Item 3 has an equal valuation for agent 0 (69) and a lower valuation for agent 1 (32), but agent 2 has less overall allocation, and thus item 3 can be allocated to agent 2.

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on given valuations and ensures each agent receives one or more items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
