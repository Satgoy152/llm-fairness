Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  11  94  30  81
1  50  80  90  37  14
2  54  71  27  28  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We will try to maximize the total valuation for the agents by making strategic decisions based on their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Look at the valuation table to identify which agent values each item the highest.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 95 (Agent 0)
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 80 (Agent 1)
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 94 (Agent 0)
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 37 (Agent 1)
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 0)

From this analysis, we can propose an allocation:

- Agent 0 should get items 0, 2, and 4 because they value them highly.
- Agent 1 should get items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 will not receive any items, as none of the highest valuations belong to them.

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on the highest valuations, maximizing the satisfaction of the agents who value the items the most.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
