Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  22  47  54  13
1  68  23  21  82  94
2  22   0  91   3   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items. We do this by examining the valuations and attempting to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences.

Let's review the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 54
  - Item 4: 13

- **Agent 1** values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 82
  - Item 4: 94

- **Agent 2** values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 3
  - Item 4: 9

We shall allocate the items by considering the highest valuations for each agent and ensuring that all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for Item 0 (70) and Item 3 (54).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are for Item 4 (94) and Item 3 (82).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for Item 2 (91).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items and need to allocate 2 more:

4. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 3 (82) is highly valued by Agent 1 and has not been allocated.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Agent 0**: 
   - The remaining item is Item 1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

The final allocation ensuring all items are distributed fairly is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
