Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  62  21   4  16
1  75  78   1   0  80
2  41  47  29  46  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction. Let's look at the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 75, Agent 2 values it at 41.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 78, Agent 2 values it at 47.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 1, Agent 2 values it at 29.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 0, Agent 2 values it at 46.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 80, Agent 2 values it at 91.

Given these valuations, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it highest at 75.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it highest at 78.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it highest at 29.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it highest at 46.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it highest at 91.

Now, let's distribute these items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: No items (as Agent 0 has the lowest or equal lowest valuation for all items compared to the other agents).
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, and 4.

This allocation ensures each item goes to the agent that values it the most, which should maximize overall satisfaction among the agents. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
