Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  87  74  18  49
1  78   4  98   4  55
2  77  46  46  44  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the respective agent if it hasn't already been allocated.

2. If any items remain unallocated, continue to allocate them to agents based on their next highest valuations, ensuring each agent does not exceed more than the number of items they can fairly receive.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value = 87).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value = 98).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value = 77).

Allocate these items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Remaining items are 3 and 4.

- Item 3: Highest remaining valuation is from Agent 2 (value = 44).
- Item 4: Highest remaining valuation is from Agent 1 (value = 55).

Allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
