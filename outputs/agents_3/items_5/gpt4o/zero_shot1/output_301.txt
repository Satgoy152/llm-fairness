Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  61   0  49  47
1  83  35  82  87  61
2  23  44  88  40  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - List each agent's highest-valued item and attempt to allocate it to them if it hasn't been allocated yet.
   
2. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 61)

3. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 87)

4. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 88)

5. **Next Steps**:
   - After assigning the highest-value items, check for any conflicts or remaining items.
   - Allocate remaining items based on maximizing the overall valuation for the agents.

6. **Allocations**:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (61 is the highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (87 is the highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (88 is the highest value for Agent 2)

7. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 4 are unallocated.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (83 is a high value for Agent 1 compared to other agents).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (80 is a high value for Agent 2 compared to other agents).

Final allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations while maximizing the total value for each agent.
