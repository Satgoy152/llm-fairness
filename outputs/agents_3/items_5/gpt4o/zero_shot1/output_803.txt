Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30   9  53  68   6
1  97  76  65  63  88
2  19  24  92   3  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations to maximize overall satisfaction. We can use a simple greedy approach by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0: 30
   - Agent 1: 97 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 19
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0: 9
   - Agent 1: 76 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 24
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0: 53
   - Agent 1: 65
   - Agent 2: 92 (highest valuation)
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0: 68 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1: 63
   - Agent 2: 3
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0: 6
   - Agent 1: 88 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 32
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 received item 3.
- Agent 1 received items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 2 received item 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated.
