Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11   1  56  93  69
1  79  40  25  11  55
2  68  56  37  96  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given the constraints. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Start by sorting the items for each agent based on their valuations.
2. Assign items to agents one by one, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and trying to maximize the total value for each agent.

### Allocation Process:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 3: 93
  - Item 4: 69
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 1

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 4: 55
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 11

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 4: 45

### Potential Fair Allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value of 96).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest available value of 79).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value of 69).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value of 56).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest available value of 56 for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed based on maximizing each agent's valuation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation keeps the total number of items at 5, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.
