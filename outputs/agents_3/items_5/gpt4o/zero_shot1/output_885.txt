Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  47  32  56  69
1  92  50  56  97  67
2  26  26  22  79  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the total value that each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's look at potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [55, 47, 32, 56, 69]
   - Highest value items: 4 (69), 3 (56)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [92, 50, 56, 97, 67]
   - Highest value items: 3 (97), 0 (92)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [26, 26, 22, 79, 57]
   - Highest value items: 3 (79), 4 (57)

Considering these valuations, we can allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because it holds the highest value for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it is their second highest valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as it is their third highest valued item and no other agent has a higher preference for it.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as it doesnâ€™t significantly impact the highest value items for other agents and provides some value to Agent 2.

Allocations based on this approach:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent receives an item allocation and attempts to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.
