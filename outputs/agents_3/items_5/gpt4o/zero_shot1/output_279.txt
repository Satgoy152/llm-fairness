Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  24  99  59  70
1  84  65  61  83  73
2  82   0  37  17  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [82  0 37 17 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets the most valuable items possible according to their valuations. We can use a greedy approach that involves assigning the highest valued items to agents until all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [81, 24, 99, 59, 70]
- Agent 1's valuations: [84, 65, 61, 83, 73]
- Agent 2's valuations: [82, 0, 37, 17, 20]

The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 0 (99). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 1 (84). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 1 (83). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 1 (73). Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 0 (24). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, which should maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation assigns 3 items to Agent 1, 2 items to Agent 0, and none to Agent 2.
