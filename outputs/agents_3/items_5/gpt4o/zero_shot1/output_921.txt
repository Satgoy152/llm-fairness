Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  80  44  97  66
1  42  81  38  33  18
2  19  39  26  30  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible based on the given valuations. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 80.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 81.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 44.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 66.

By this allocation, Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, 3, and 4, and Agent 1 gets item 1. Agent 2 does not receive any items because they have the lowest valuation for all items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": []
}
```
