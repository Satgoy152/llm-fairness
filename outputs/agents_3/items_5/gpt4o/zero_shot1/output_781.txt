Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  10  57  80  84
1   5  13  80  46  46
2  57   5  51  12  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: 28
   - Item 1: 10
   - Item 2: 57
   - Item 3: 80
   - Item 4: 84

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: 5
   - Item 1: 13
   - Item 2: 80
   - Item 3: 46
   - Item 4: 46

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0: 57
   - Item 1: 5
   - Item 2: 51
   - Item 3: 12
   - Item 4: 93

**Allocation Strategy:**
- To determine the allocation, start by looking at the item with the highest single valuation and allocate it to the respective agent. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

**Allocation:**
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation 93).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation 80).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 80).
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation 57).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 13).

**Resulting Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

Agent 0 receives item 3, Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, and Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4. This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.
