Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  70   8  67  12
1  63  54  90  65  20
2  70  93  51  75  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive based on their valuations, while also striving for a balanced distribution. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to the agents who value them the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 70.
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
   
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
   
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 20.

Now, let's see the allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are allocated based on the highest valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
