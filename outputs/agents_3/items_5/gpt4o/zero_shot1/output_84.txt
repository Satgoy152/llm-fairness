Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  38  72  40   6
1   7  65  13  35  88
2  31  31  44  49  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Consider the highest valuation for each item and allocate the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Make sure each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the items:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 38
  - Agent 1 values it at 7
  - Agent 2 values it at 31
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 38
  - Agent 1 values it at 65
  - Agent 2 values it at 31
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 72
  - Agent 1 values it at 13
  - Agent 2 values it at 44
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 40
  - Agent 1 values it at 35
  - Agent 2 values it at 49
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 6
  - Agent 1 values it at 88
  - Agent 2 values it at 96
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value)

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
