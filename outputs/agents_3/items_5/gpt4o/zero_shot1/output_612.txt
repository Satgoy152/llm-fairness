Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  94  51  85  25
1  38  78  92  14  90
2  18  75  99  50  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations for each item. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values are for items 1 (94) and 3 (85).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values are for items 2 (92) and 4 (90).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value is for item 2 (99), but item 2 is already a high-value item for Agent 1. Other high values are for item 4 (71) and item 1 (75).

Given these preferences, we can proceed with the following allocation strategy:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it's their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it's the next highest value for them.

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it's their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it's another high-value item for them.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it hasn't been allocated yet and ensures each agent gets at least one item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 5.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
