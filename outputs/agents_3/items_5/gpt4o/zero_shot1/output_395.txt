Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  38  85  75  49
1  87  81  90  61  22
2  94  82  46  79  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing overall satisfaction. Let's consider a few approaches to achieve this:

1. **Maximizing Total Valuation**: Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes the total sum of valuations.
2. **Fair Share**: Ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 38, 85, 75, 49]
- Agent 1: [87, 81, 90, 61, 22]
- Agent 2: [94, 82, 46, 79, 23]

Let's evaluate an allocation strategy that maximizes total valuation by considering each agent's preference:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (value 94). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (value 90). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (value 75). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values item 1 the second highest (value 81). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** values item 4 next (value 49). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value while distributing the items fairly based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns two items to Agent 0, two items to Agent 1, and one item to Agent 2, ensuring a fair and optimal distribution based on the given valuations.
