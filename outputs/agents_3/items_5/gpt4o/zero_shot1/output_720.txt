Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  89  18  23  66
1  60  96  33  39  16
2  95   6  46  85  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent or trying to balance the allocation based on preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1, but since Agent 0 values it highly as well, assigning it to Agent 0 might be better for overall fairness, while Agent 1 can take items with lower conflict.
3. **Agent 2** has a very high valuation for item 0 and item 3.

Considering these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

Following this approach, each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences, maximizing the overall satisfaction given the constraints.
