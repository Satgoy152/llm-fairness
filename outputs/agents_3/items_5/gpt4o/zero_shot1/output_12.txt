Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  51  64   0  47
1  25  45  43  81  98
2  78   2  70  80  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to maximize total satisfaction or fairness. One common method to achieve fairness is to assign items in a way that maximizes the sum of the minimum valuations each agent receives. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [88, 51, 64, 0, 47]
   - Agent 1: [25, 45, 43, 81, 98]
   - Agent 2: [78, 2, 70, 80, 75]

2. **Assign the highest valued items to the agents for maximizing the overall satisfaction:**

   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most with 88, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most with 98, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most with 80, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Assign the remaining items by considering which agent values them more, without duplicating items:**

   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 45, and Agent 2 at 2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 43, and Agent 2 at 70. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3.

Finally, present the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
