Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  28  95  18  83
1  68  23  48  66  99
2  91  52  22   5  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value, we can employ a strategy to ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 77
  - Agent 1 values it at 68
  - Agent 2 values it at 91
  - **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2** (highest value of 91)

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 28
  - Agent 1 values it at 23
  - Agent 2 values it at 52
  - **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2** (highest value of 52)

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 95
  - Agent 1 values it at 48
  - Agent 2 values it at 22
  - **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0** (highest value of 95)

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 18
  - Agent 1 values it at 66
  - Agent 2 values it at 5
  - **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1** (highest value of 66)

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 83
  - Agent 1 values it at 99
  - Agent 2 values it at 20
  - **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1** (highest value of 99)

After assigning each item to the agent with the highest valuation, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
