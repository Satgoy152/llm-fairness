Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  89  55  98  35
1   5  76  76   6  59
2  59   9  41  19  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the total valuation.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 with a valuation of 98.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is items 1 and 2, both with a valuation of 76. 
   - Since item 1 has a higher valuation for Agent 0, we assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 with a valuation of 68.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 and moderately by Agent 1. Since Agent 0 already has item 3 (with the highest overall valuation), it's reasonable to allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the allocations.
- Item 0 is left. It is valued at 26 by Agent 0, 5 by Agent 1, and 59 by Agent 2. To maximize satisfaction, allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 0.

Here is the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
