Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  59  28  75  72
1  36  44  91  73  92
2  79  11  39   8  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can employ a method that maximizes the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on the items, ensuring that each item is given to the agent who values it most.

Let's examine the values for each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values at 19
  - Agent 1 values at 36
  - Agent 2 values at 79
  - Best allocation: Agent 2

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values at 59
  - Agent 1 values at 44
  - Agent 2 values at 11
  - Best allocation: Agent 0

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values at 28
  - Agent 1 values at 91
  - Agent 2 values at 39
  - Best allocation: Agent 1

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values at 75
  - Agent 1 values at 73
  - Agent 2 values at 8
  - Best allocation: Agent 0

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values at 72
  - Agent 1 values at 92
  - Agent 2 values at 64
  - Best allocation: Agent 1

Based on this analysis, the allocations will be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are fairly distributed according to the highest valuations.
