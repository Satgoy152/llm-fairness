Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  88  21  82  96
1  49  47  53  59  14
2  64  13  11  68  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations of items for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We have 3 agents and 5 items, so one agent will receive 1 item, and the other two will receive 2 items each.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 13, 88, 21, 82, 96
- Agent 1: 49, 47, 53, 59, 14
- Agent 2: 64, 13, 11, 68, 96

A possible allocation strategy is to maximize the value each agent gets while ensuring fair distribution. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 96)
   - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 59)
   - Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 64)

2. Assign the remaining items to ensure fairness:
   - Agent 0: items 4, 1 (values 96, 88)
   - Agent 1: items 3, 2 (values 59, 53)
   - Agent 2: item 0 (value 64)

This allocation is one of the fair distributions based on maximizing individual values for each agent initially and then distributing remaining items to keep the distribution fair.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
