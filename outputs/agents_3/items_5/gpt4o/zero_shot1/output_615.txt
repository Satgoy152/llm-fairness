Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  18  34  83  76
1   4  45  15  64  56
2  15  63  81  11  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's try to allocate items by considering the highest valuations first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

**Allocating Items:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation is for items 0 and 3 (value 83). Since we need to allocate distinct items, let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 45). Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 81). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Now we have allocated three items, and we need to allocate two more items.

4. **Remaining Items (3 and 4):**
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 0 has the highest valuation (value 83), but agent 1 also has a relatively high valuation (value 64). 
     - Since agent 0 already has an item, let's give item 3 to agent 1.

   - For item 4:
     - Agent 0 has the highest valuation (value 76). Since agent 2 already has an item, and agent 1 already has two items, let's give item 4 to agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution.
