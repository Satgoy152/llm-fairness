Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  79  72  93  60
1  72  13  30  37  95
2  54  90  39  47  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 13 30 37 95]
 [54 90 39 47 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations:

Here are the agents and their valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [25, 79, 72, 93, 60]
- Agent 1: [72, 13, 30, 37, 95]
- Agent 2: [54, 90, 39, 47, 20]

We will consider each agent's preferences and try to allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 (93) and 1 (79).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (95) the highest.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (90).

Allocate items:

- **Item 3** to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0)
- **Item 1** to Agent 2 (highest valuation by Agent 2)
- **Item 4** to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1)

Now, allocate the remaining items (0 and 2):

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (72) after considering the previous allocations.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 72, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 2
- Agent 1: Items 4, 0
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
