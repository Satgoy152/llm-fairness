Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  58   7  61  56
1   4  74  37  23  47
2  52  12  64  90  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations of each agent and tries to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the most at 61.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most at 74.
   - Agent 2 values Item 3 the most at 90.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 90, so Agent 2 receives Item 3.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 74, so Agent 1 receives Item 1.

3. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items:**

   - Remaining items are 0, 2, and 4.

4. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 52, which is the highest among the agents, so Agent 2 receives Item 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 64, which is the highest among the agents, so Agent 2 receives Item 2.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 56, which is the highest remaining valuation, so Agent 0 receives Item 4.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 3

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is five.
