Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  14  16  36  63
1  29  67  63   6  55
2  88  20  29  99  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences and valuations of the agents for each item. One approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (63), Item 0 (36), Item 3 (36)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (67), Item 2 (63), Item 4 (55)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 0 (88), Item 2 (29)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (Item 0 and Item 2). Consider the next highest valuations for these items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (88), Agent 0 (36), Agent 1 (29)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (63), Agent 2 (29), Agent 0 (16)

Allocate based on the highest available preference:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (88)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (63)

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized given the constraints.
