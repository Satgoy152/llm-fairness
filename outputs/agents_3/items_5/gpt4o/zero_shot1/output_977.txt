Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  18  51  72   4
1  37  76  90  73  84
2  99  33  80  49  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 33 80 49 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's evaluate the most optimal allocation based on the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: Values = [80, 18, 51, 72, 4]
Agent 1: Values = [37, 76, 90, 73, 84]
Agent 2: Values = [99, 33, 80, 49, 72]
```

One approach to maximize value is to allocate the highest value item to each agent iteratively, ensuring all items are assigned. We can use a greedy algorithm to perform this allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most at 76.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most at 84.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing total value for each agent where possible.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
