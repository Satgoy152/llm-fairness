Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  76  21  72  35
1  19  55  37  89  52
2  77  53  45  76  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. One way to approach this is by trying to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest valued items are: 0 (96), 1 (76), 3 (72)

- Agent 1: 
  - Highest valued items are: 3 (89), 1 (55), 4 (52)

- Agent 2: 
  - Highest valued items are: 0 (77), 3 (76), 4 (76)

Given these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Allocate item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highest (96), and Agent 2 also values it highly (77). 
   - Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 highest (89), and Agent 2 also values it highly (76).
   - Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate item 1**:
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (76), but Agent 1 also values it (55).
   - Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Allocate item 4**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly (76), and Agent 1 also has a decent valuation for it (52).
   - Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

5. **Allocate item 2**:
   - The remaining item is 2. Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 2 (45) than the other agents.
   - Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Here's how the allocations look based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.
