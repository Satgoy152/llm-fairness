Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  60  99  93  35
1  28  53   5  34  34
2  49  99   2  76   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to fair allocation is to try to maximize the overall satisfaction of agents by considering their preferences. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [50, 60, 99, 93, 35]
Agent 1: [28, 53, 5, 34, 34]
Agent 2: [49, 99, 2, 76, 0]
```

We can use the following strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
2. If there's a tie in valuations, consider the overall distribution and try to balance the allocations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (50).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (99).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (34).

By following these allocations, we ensure that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most and that the allocations are balanced across agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
