Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  65  92  99  17
1  70  44  19  38  16
2  18  57  77  90  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's how the allocation can be done step-by-step:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 18
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 57
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 77
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 38
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
