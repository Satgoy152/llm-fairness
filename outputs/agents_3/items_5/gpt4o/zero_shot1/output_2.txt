Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  91  52  13  10
1  55  45  37  70  48
2   6  98  83  89  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6 98 83 89 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying which items each agent values the most.
2. **Prioritize High Valuations:** Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each item is only given to one agent.
3. **Balance Allocations:** Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, but since we have more items than agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 85.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 70.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 98.

From here, we can allocate these high-value items to each respective agent:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Now, we have 2 more items to allocate (items 2 and 4):

- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2 at 83, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- The remaining item 4 has a higher valuation from Agent 1 at 48 compared to Agent 0 at 10, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent that values it highly, while also distributing the items fairly among the agents.
