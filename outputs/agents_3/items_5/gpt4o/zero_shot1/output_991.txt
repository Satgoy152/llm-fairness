Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  82  49  44   3
1  76   2  76  50  20
2  96  82  50   9  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a few strategies, such as maximizing the total value each agent receives or ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given the input table of valuations, one approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as this might lead to a reasonable distribution based on the given preferences.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent\Item   0   1   2   3   4
0            72  82  49  44   3
1            76   2  76  50  20
2            96  82  50   9  62
```

For each item, let's find the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 96 (highest among agents).
- Item 1: Agents 0 and 2 both value it at 82. We'll assign it to Agent 0 for balance.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 76 (highest among agents).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 50 (highest among agents).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 62 (highest among agents).

Based on the above analysis, the allocation strategy is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed according to who values them the most, given the constraints.
