Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  34  53  56  30
1   4  53   9  86  86
2  28  20  77  56  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 2 has the highest value for agent 0 with a valuation of 53.
   - Item 3 also has a high value for agent 0 with a valuation of 56.
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Item 4 has the highest valuation for agent 1 with a value of 86.
   - Item 1 also has a high valuation for agent 1 with a value of 53.

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 0 can be allocated to agent 2, and it has a valuation of 28.

This allocation aims to achieve a reasonably fair distribution based on the agents' valuations. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations, and all 5 items are allocated.
