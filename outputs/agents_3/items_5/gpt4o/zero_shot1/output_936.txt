Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  21  20  98  52
1  68  21  13  78  71
2  53  13  50   8  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [53 13 50  8 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 9, 21, 20, 98, 52
- Agent 1 values: 68, 21, 13, 78, 71
- Agent 2 values: 53, 13, 50, 8, 49

We can use a simple greedy approach by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 9
   - Agent 1: 68 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 53
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 21
   - Agent 1: 21
   - Agent 2: 13
   - Allocate to Agent 0 or 1 (let's choose Agent 0 for balance)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 20
   - Agent 1: 13
   - Agent 2: 50 (highest value)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 98 (highest value)
   - Agent 1: 78
   - Agent 2: 8
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 52
   - Agent 1: 71 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 49
   - Allocate to Agent 1

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 5 items are allocated.
