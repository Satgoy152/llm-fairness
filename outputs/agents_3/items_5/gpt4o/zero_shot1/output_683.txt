Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  83  78  63  63
1  40  31  26  98  95
2   8  85  35  50  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (83), 2 (78), 3 (63), 4 (63), 0 (45)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (98), 4 (95), 0 (40), 1 (31), 2 (26)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (85), 3 (50), 2 (35), 4 (35), 0 (8)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is the next available item with a high value for them.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining two items (0 and 2):

- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (45) has the next highest value for Agent 0.
- **Agent 2:** Item 2 (35) is assigned to Agent 2, as it has a higher value for them compared to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the overall valuation.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
