Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  40  90  99  69
1  25  32  78  95  93
2  85  72  53  75  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on the valuations given. However, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.

Given the valuations, let's consider how to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (99), followed by item 2 (90).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (93), followed by item 3 (95).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (85), followed by item 1 (72).

A possible allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items is:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it's the highest value for Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it's the highest value for Agent 1 that hasn't been taken.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it's the highest value for Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it benefits Agent 2 more than the others.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it gives a high value to Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
