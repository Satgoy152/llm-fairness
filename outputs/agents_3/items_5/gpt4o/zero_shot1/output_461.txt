Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  51  75  51  98
1  49  91   1  19  27
2  62  53   7  91  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method like maximizing total satisfaction or ensuring each agent gets at least one high-value item. One common approach is to use a method that tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction (value) each agent receives, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given values:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 98, so assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 91, so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 91, so assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items, 0 and 2.
5. Agent 0 values item 2 second most at 75, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
6. Lastly, item 0 is left, and Agent 1 values it at 49, the highest among the unallocated items, so assign item 0 to agent 1.

The allocations can be represented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one item they highly value while ensuring all items are allocated.
