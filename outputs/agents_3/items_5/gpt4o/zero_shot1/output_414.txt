Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  58  72  16  47
1  98  66  20  42  36
2  44  70  40  63   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [44 70 40 63  2]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will use the valuations provided in the table. The aim is to allocate all 5 items to the agents in a way that maximizes their total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is for item 2, with a valuation of 72.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 0, with a valuation of 98.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is for item 3, with a valuation of 63.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items: item 2 (Agent 0), item 0 (Agent 1), and item 3 (Agent 2). We still need to allocate 2 more items.

4. **Remaining items (1 and 4)**:
   - For item 1, Agent 0 has a valuation of 58, Agent 1 has a valuation of 66, and Agent 2 has a valuation of 70. The highest valuation is by Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

5. **Final item 4**:
   - For item 4, Agent 0 has a valuation of 47, Agent 1 has a valuation of 36, and Agent 2 has a valuation of 2. The highest valuation is by Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
