Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27   3   5  32  30
1  32  82  43  51   6
2  60  62  45  79  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One possible approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. Item 0: Valuations are [27, 32, 60]. Agent 2 values it the most.
2. Item 1: Valuations are [3, 82, 62]. Agent 1 values it the most.
3. Item 2: Valuations are [5, 43, 45]. Agent 2 values it the most.
4. Item 3: Valuations are [32, 51, 79]. Agent 2 values it the most.
5. Item 4: Valuations are [30, 6, 21]. Agent 0 values it the most.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, and 3.

The allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

All 5 items have been allocated, and each agent has at least one item.
