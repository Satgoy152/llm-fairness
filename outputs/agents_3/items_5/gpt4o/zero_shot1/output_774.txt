Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  11  85  23   8
1  35  79  15  42  41
2  69  67  50  42  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35 79 15 42 41]
 [69 67 50 42 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent and ensure that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 3 agents and 5 items). We'll try to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 11, 85, 23, 8]
- Agent 1: [35, 79, 15, 42, 41]
- Agent 2: [69, 67, 50, 42, 72]

We'll allocate items such that we consider the highest available value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (value 85).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 1 (value 79).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 72).

Next, allocate the remaining items:

- For Agent 0, allocate item 0 (value 49) since it is the second highest after item 2 and no conflict with other agents.
- For Agent 1, allocate item 3 (value 42) since it is the second highest after item 1 and no conflict with other agents.

Now, all 5 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 0
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 4

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
