Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  17  64  87  16
1   6  47  76  63  58
2  99   1  90  78   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider the values that each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: [48, 17, 64, 87, 16]
- Agent 1: [6, 47, 76, 63, 58]
- Agent 2: [99, 1, 90, 78, 3]

We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

1. Agent 2 values item 0 highest at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 highest at 87. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 2 highest at 76. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 second highest at 64, but it's already allocated. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 1).
5. Agent 1 values item 4 second highest at 58, and it's unallocated. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

Now we check allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest valuations while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
