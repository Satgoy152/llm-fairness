Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78   1  70  95  25
1  66  12  49  95  71
2  62  57  55  30  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest valued items. Here is one potential fair allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (95).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (95), but since Agent 0 already has it, we consider their next highest valued item, which is item 4 (71).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 (64) the highest, but since Agent 1 already has it, we consider their next highest valued item, which is item 0 (62).

Now, for the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has item 3 and their next highest valued item is item 0 (78), which is not taken.
- Agent 1 has item 4 and their next highest after item 3 and item 4 is item 0 (66), which is taken, so we consider item 2 (49).
- Agent 2 has item 0 and their next highest valued item is item 2 (55), which can be taken.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 and item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 4 and item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 0, but since item 0 is taken by Agent 0, we give them item 1.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed.
