Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  51  84  19  60
1  25  43  28  81  77
2  89  32  33  43  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [86, 51, 84, 19, 60]
Agent 1: [25, 43, 28, 81, 77]
Agent 2: [89, 32, 33, 43, 70]
```

A common method to achieve fair allocation is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items based on the highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 0 (84) and Agent 2 (33). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 2 (89) and Agent 0 (86). Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 3** is highly valued by Agent 1 (81) and Agent 2 (43). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 1 (77) and Agent 2 (70). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 1** is left, valued highest by Agent 0 (51) and least by Agent 2 (32). Allocate to Agent 0.

So the allocations would be:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item, maximizing the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.
