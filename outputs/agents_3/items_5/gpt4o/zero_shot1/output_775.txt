Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  15   2  35  32
1  61  98  11  67  53
2  37  21  53  19  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We want to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the overall distribution is balanced based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [35, 15, 2, 35, 32].
- Agent 1 values the items as: [61, 98, 11, 67, 53].
- Agent 2 values the items as: [37, 21, 53, 19, 39].

We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets the items for which they have relatively high valuations compared to the others:

1. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (98), so it makes sense to give item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 0 and item 3 both at 35, but among these, Agent 2 values item 0 higher than Agent 3, so we give item 0 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (53), so we will allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Now, Agent 0 and Agent 2 both have one item. We need to allocate item 3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 at 35, so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, item 4 is left. Agent 1 values it at 53, which is the highest among the agents, so we'll assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [2]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
