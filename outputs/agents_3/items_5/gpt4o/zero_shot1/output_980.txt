Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  78  15  26  82
1  69  62  30  24  78
2  74  58  27  52  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (95) and item 1 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Has relatively high valuations for item 2 (30) and item 4 (78).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 4 (99) and a decent valuation for item 3 (52).

To ensure a fair distribution of items, we need to consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated and every agent can potentially get at least one item.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (95)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (62)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (99)
- Agent 0: Item 3 (26)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (30)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

Presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
