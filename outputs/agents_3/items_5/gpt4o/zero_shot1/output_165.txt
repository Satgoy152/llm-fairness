Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  43  35  26  59
1  70  85  34  26  15
2  79  10  58  86  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible, given that there are 5 items and 3 agents. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as 12, 43, 35, 26, and 59, respectively.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as 70, 85, 34, 26, and 15, respectively.
- Agent 2 values items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as 79, 10, 58, 86, and 15, respectively.

We can allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 59).
2. Item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 85).
3. Item 3 to Agent 2 (value: 86).
4. Item 0 to Agent 1 (value: 70).
5. Item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 58).

This allocation provides a reasonable distribution based on the values, maximizing the overall satisfaction for each agent.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
