Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  38  96  29  53
1   2  91  71  88  16
2  34  37  23  46  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Let's evaluate each agent's value for each item and distribute the items accordingly.

Here's the valuation table:

```
        0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0  41  38  96  29  53
Agent 1   2  91  71  88  16
Agent 2  34  37  23  46  11
```

We can use a strategy where we allocate items based on the highest value that an agent assigns to an item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 2 (96).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (91) and item 3 (88).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (46) the highest among the remaining options if 3 is not taken by Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** can take item 0 (41) as it is the next highest value for them.
5. **Agent 2** can take item 4 (11) as it is the next highest value for them.

Let's decide based on the highest values and ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2, Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 1, Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 4

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on the agents' preferences, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
