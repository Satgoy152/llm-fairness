Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  79  78  14  75
1  72  67  48  59  58
2  30   3  52  56  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the table of valuations for clarity:

```
        Item
         0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0  2  79  78  14  75
Agent 1 72  67  48  59  58
Agent 2 30   3  52  56  22
```

To fairly allocate the items, let's consider the highest value each agent has for any item and ensure each item is allocated to maximize the total value:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Check that each agent gets a fair number of items (as evenly distributed as possible).

Following this approach:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 1 (72).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (79).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (78).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 2 (56).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0 (75).

However, this allocation gives Agent 0 too many items (3 items) and leaves Agent 1 and Agent 2 with only 1 item each. We need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness and balance.

Revisiting allocations to ensure fairness:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest after Agent 2).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This way:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

With this allocation, each agent gets a fair number of items and the allocation maximizes the individual values.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
