Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  67  36  57  41
1   7  92  63  29  48
2  58  65  51   1  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share according to their valuations while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate items accordingly:

Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 67
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 57
- Item 4: 41

Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 7
- Item 1: 92
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 48

Agent 2's Valuations:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 65
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 1
- Item 4: 31

Based on these valuations, we can make the following allocations:

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 1 and Item 3, so we can allocate those items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values Item 1 and Item 2, but since Item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, we can give Agent 1 the next highest valued items they have not been allocated, which are Item 2 and Item 4.
3. Agent 2 highly values Item 0 and Item 1, but since Item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, we can give Agent 2 Item 0, which is their highest value remaining.

Given this analysis, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 and Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2 and Item 4.
- Agent 2 receives Item 0.

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
