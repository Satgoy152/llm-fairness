Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  32  34  42  82
1  84  52  65  33  42
2  88  11   3  84  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [88 11  3 84 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation by considering each agent's preferences. One common method is the "Maximum Sum Allocation" approach, which tries to maximize the sum of the values of items allocated to each agent. Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

### Valuation Table:

- Agent 0: [43, 32, 34, 42, 82]
- Agent 1: [84, 52, 65, 33, 42]
- Agent 2: [88, 11, 3, 84, 20]

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 4 (Highest Valuation: Agent 0, 82)**  
   Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it the most.

2. **Item 3 (Highest Valuation: Agent 2, 84)**  
   Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the most.

3. **Item 0 (Highest Valuation: Agent 2, 88)**  
   Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the most.

4. **Item 1 (Highest Valuation: Agent 1, 52)**  
   Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it more than any other available item.

5. **Item 2 (Highest Valuation: Agent 1, 65)**  
   Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the most after previous allocations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated fairly.
