Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  34  70  96  64
1  78  66  67  59  85
2  50  75  91  14  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, trying to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 34, 70, 96, 64]
- Agent 1: [78, 66, 67, 59, 85]
- Agent 2: [50, 75, 91, 14, 80]

To allocate the items, we can assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will attempt to distribute the items as evenly as possible:

1. Item 0: The highest value is 78 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: The highest value is 75 by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: The highest value is 91 by Agent 2.
4. Item 3: The highest value is 96 by Agent 0.
5. Item 4: The highest value is 85 by Agent 1.

Given these assignments:
- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations, and all five items are allocated.
