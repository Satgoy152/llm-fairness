Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  64  39  23  49
1  70  74  32   5   6
2   0  16  88  34  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to try to maximize the total valuation, ensuring each agent receives items they value highly while distributing all the items.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [66, 64, 39, 23, 49]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [70, 74, 32, 5, 6]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [0, 16, 88, 34, 64]

We aim to allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is for Agent 1 (70).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is for Agent 1 (74).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is for Agent 2 (88).
4. **Item 3**: Second highest value is for Agent 2 (34) since Agent 1 has low value (5).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is for Agent 2 (64).

A possible allocation based on these valuations is:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check if this allocation is fair:

- Agent 0: Receives no items, but their high-value items are prioritized for others.
- Agent 1: Receives items 0 and 1, which are their highest value items.
- Agent 2: Receives items 2, 3, and 4, which are high-value for them.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total value is maximized for the agents.
