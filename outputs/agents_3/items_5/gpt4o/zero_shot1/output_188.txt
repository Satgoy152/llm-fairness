Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  88  22  90  66
1  16  19   9  62  75
2  62  31  69  21  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Hereâ€™s one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 and 3. To maximize their total value, allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a higher valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 2 and a decent value for item 0. Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 2.

Now let's put these allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation across all agents.
