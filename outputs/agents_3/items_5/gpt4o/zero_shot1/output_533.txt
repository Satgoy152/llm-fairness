Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  20  47  46  87
1  78  84  18  49   9
2   9   0   5   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to give each agent the items that maximize their total value while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values items 0 and 4 the most, with values 85 and 87, respectively. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most, with a value of 84. Assign this item to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most, but since it is already assigned to Agent 0, we allocate item 2 to Agent 2, which has a value of 5, the maximum available for Agent 2 given the remaining items.
4. The remaining item is item 3, which Agent 1 values the most of the unallocated items, with a value of 49. Assign this to Agent 1.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items that maximize their total value given the constraints, while all items are allocated.
