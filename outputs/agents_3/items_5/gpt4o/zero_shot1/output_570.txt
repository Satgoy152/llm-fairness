Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  93  34  17  27
1  78  43  79  54  90
2  66   2  42  38  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value across all agents. This might not always be perfect, but it aims to make the distribution as fair as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 27

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 43
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 54
  - Item 4: 90

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 11

A possible fair allocation would be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 (value 78)
2. Item 1: Agent 0 (value 93)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 (value 79)
4. Item 3: Agent 1 (value 54)
5. Item 4: Agent 1 (value 90)

However, this results in Agent 1 getting too many items, so let's attempt a more balanced allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1 (value 93).
- Agent 1 gets Item 0 (value 78) and Item 2 (value 79).
- Agent 2 gets Item 3 (value 38) and Item 4 (value 11).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and it tries to respect the highest value preferences where possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
