Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  26  91  98  71
1  85  52  13   4  39
2  92  88  70  10  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because they value it the most at 98.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because they value it at 85, which is higher than other agents.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because they value it at 88, which is the highest value for that item.
4. Now, agent 0 has one item, agent 1 has one item, and agent 2 has one item. We still need to allocate items 2 and 4.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because they value it highly at 91.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because they value it at 62, which is higher than agent 1's valuation of 39.

Now each agent has been allocated items, and all items are distributed. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
