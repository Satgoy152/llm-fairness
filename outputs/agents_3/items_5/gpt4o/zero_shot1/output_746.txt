Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  72  75  63  72
1  15  64  75  60  65
2  86  57  39  98  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the happiness of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (74), Item 2 (75)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (75), Item 1 (64)
   - Since Item 2 is already allocated, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (98), Item 0 (86)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we still have items 0 and 4 left to allocate:

- **Agent 2** can take Item 0, as they value it highly at 86.
- **Agent 1** can take Item 4, as they value it at 65, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 72.

This allocation ensures no items are left unallocated while considering the agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
