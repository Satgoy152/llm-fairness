Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  52  83  99  67
1  61  32  70  85  65
2  75  51  95  36  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll consider the agents' preferences and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 3 (99), Item 2 (83), Item 4 (67).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 3 (85), Item 2 (70), Item 0 (61).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 2 (95), Item 0 (75), Item 1 (51).

We will allocate items to maximize the total valuation:

- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95, which is the highest single valuation for any item.
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it at 99, and it's their highest valuation.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2**: This is Agent 2's second-highest valuation at 75.
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: This is Agent 0's second-highest valuation at 52.
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: This is Agent 1's third-highest valuation at 65, and it ensures each agent gets at least one item.

The final allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
