Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  88  72   6   2
1  80  86  47  54  48
2  20  94   2  13  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. One common approach is to use a combinatorial optimization method, such as maximizing the total valuation or using a fair division algorithm. Here, we will try to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their highest-valued items.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (88), Item 2 (72), Item 0 (33)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (80), Item 1 (86), Item 3 (54)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 4 (64)
   - Since Item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 3:

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (72), followed by Agent 1 (47), but let's allocate based on remaining needs.
   - Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (54), followed by Agent 2 (13).

Considering the need for balance and based on remaining highest valuations:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, considering their valuations.
