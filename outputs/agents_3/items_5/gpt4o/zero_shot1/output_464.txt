Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  67  73  71  68
1  73  43   8  76  58
2  99   4  89  32   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items. A common approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems, which seeks to find a maximum-weight matching.

Let's analyze the table to determine the optimal allocation:

```
Agent 0: Values [46, 67, 73, 71, 68]
Agent 1: Values [73, 43, 8, 76, 58]
Agent 2: Values [99, 4, 89, 32, 5]
```

We'll attempt to allocate items by prioritizing the highest-value items for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (73). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (76). Assign item 3 to agent 1.

Now we have allocated 3 items. The remaining items are 1 and 4. Let's allocate these to maximize overall satisfaction:

4. **Agent 0** values item 1 (67) second highest among unallocated items. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values item 4 (58) second highest among unallocated items and agent 2 does not value it highly. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

This provides each agent with a set of items maximizing their perceived value, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items that maximize their personal valuations.
