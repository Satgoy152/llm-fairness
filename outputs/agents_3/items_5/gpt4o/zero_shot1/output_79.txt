Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  37  66  95  67
1  94  67  25  37  44
2  76  76  96  41   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This problem resembles a type of assignment problem, which can be approached with various strategies, including the Hungarian method or heuristic approaches. For simplicity and fairness, let's try a straightforward allocation that ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their valuations.

Let's start by assigning the highest valued item that each agent highly values. Then, we will adjust to ensure that all items are allocated:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (95).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (94).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (96).

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, and 3. We need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4.

For the remaining items:
- Agent 0 values item 4 the most after item 3 (67).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most after item 2 (76).

Thus, we can allocate:
- Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Item 1 to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their individual valuations based on the given table.
