Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  81  70  14  99
1  66  28  29  18  59
2   9  60  18  62  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will do this by examining the valuations and trying to give each agent items that they value highly.

Let's start by considering the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (81), 1 (81), 4 (99) highly.
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (66), 2 (29), 4 (59) highly.
- Agent 2 values items: 1 (60), 3 (62) highly.

Now, let's attempt an allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, since it's their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued and Agent 0 already has a high-value item.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, since it's their highest valued item.

Now we have items 1 and 2 left to distribute:

4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly.
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, since it is valued higher by Agent 1 than Agent 2.

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
