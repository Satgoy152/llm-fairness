Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  41  30  28  69
1  27  36  92  97  70
2   4  14  70  46  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value received by each agent. One strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest individual valuations. We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most and ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual item valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 72 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 41 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 92 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 97 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 75 by Agent 2.

Reviewing the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
