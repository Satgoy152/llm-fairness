Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  74  48  56  13
1  71  64  87  44  30
2  50  94  90   1  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [50 94 90  1 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation reflects the agents' valuations as best as possible. One way to approach this is by maximizing the total valuation across all allocations.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  74  48  56  13
1  71  64  87  44  30
2  50  94  90   1  48
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how we can allocate:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 71.
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 94.
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 87.
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 56.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 48.

Now we assign the items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 4.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
