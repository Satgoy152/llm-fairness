Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  64  41  56  32
1  46  56  90  45  72
2  85  48  99  60  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 56 90 45 72]
 [85 48 99 60 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This doesn't necessarily mean each agent gets an equal amount of value, but rather that we'll try to make each agent as satisfied as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  64  41  56  32
1  46  56  90  45  72
2  85  48  99  60  80
```

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (64).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (90).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (99).

To avoid conflicts over item 2:
- Agent 1 is given item 2 for their highest value (90), which is slightly less than Agent 2's valuation but allows for a more balanced distribution of other items.

Let's make allocations based on maximizing value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0:** Item 1 (64)
- **Agent 1:** Item 2 (90)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0 (85), 3 (60), and 4 (80)

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to only one agent, and it attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
