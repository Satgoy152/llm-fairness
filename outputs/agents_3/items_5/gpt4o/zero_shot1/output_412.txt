Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  37  19  33  76
1  48  87  44  62  12
2  25  99  10   8  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a method that maximizes the total value of the allocations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to accomplish this:

1. **List each agent's highest value item**:
   - Agent 0: [79 (Item 0), 76 (Item 4)]
   - Agent 1: [87 (Item 1), 62 (Item 3)]
   - Agent 2: [99 (Item 1), 67 (Item 4)]

2. **Allocate items based on the highest value and distribute them fairly**:
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 2 already received a high-value item, this item goes to the next highest non-conflicted agent).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (last remaining item).

Given this strategy, we achieve a balanced allocation based on maximizing total value:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
