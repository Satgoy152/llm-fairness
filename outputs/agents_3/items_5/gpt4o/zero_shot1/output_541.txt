Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  91  59  90   9
1  99  25  96  10  78
2  34  81  18  83  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations and try to find an allocation that achieves this:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [49, 91, 59, 90, 9]
- Agent 1: [99, 25, 96, 10, 78]
- Agent 2: [34, 81, 18, 83, 77]

A possible fair allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it results in an integer allocation for each agent. Let's evaluate this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest (99).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest (91).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest (96).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest (83).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest (78).

By following this allocation strategy, we achieve:

- Agent 0: [1] (Item 1)
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4] (Items 0, 2, and 4)
- Agent 2: [3] (Item 3)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
