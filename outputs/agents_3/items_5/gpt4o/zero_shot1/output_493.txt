Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  0  65  73   9  42
1  2  94  89  14  27
2  8   4  21   8   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. A simple and common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations, often referred to as the "maximum sum" or "utilitarian" allocation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 73). Next highest is item 1 (value 65), and item 4 (value 42).

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 94), followed by item 2 (value 89).

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 21), but since item 2 is taken, the next highest is item 0 (value 8) and item 3 (value 8).

Given these considerations, here's a fair allocation:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (89).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, since their second highest value is 65.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest available value (8).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, since Agent 2's next highest value is also 8.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their third highest value (42).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the total valuation.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing the overall value each agent receives based on their preferences.
