Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  99  55   4   2
1  61  47  64  17  23
2  75  89  49  11  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or valuation) for all agents. One way to approach this problem is to use a greedy method, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocations can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 20.
   - Agent 1 values it at 61.
   - Agent 2 values it at 75.
   - **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99.
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Agent 2 values it at 89.
   - **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0** (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55.
   - Agent 1 values it at 64.
   - Agent 2 values it at 49.
   - **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1** (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 4.
   - Agent 1 values it at 17.
   - Agent 2 values it at 11.
   - **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1** (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 2.
   - Agent 1 values it at 23.
   - Agent 2 values it at 35.
   - **Assign Item 4 to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated based on the highest valuations.
