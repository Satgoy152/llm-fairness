Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  41   3  56  57
1   6  99  66  32  95
2  21  11  45  83  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [15, 41, 3, 56, 57]
Agent 1: [6, 99, 66, 32, 95]
Agent 2: [21, 11, 45, 83, 36]
```

Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the items where Agent 0 has relatively high valuations compared to others. Item 3 (value 56) and Item 4 (value 57) are decent choices.

2. **Agent 1**: Assign the items where Agent 1 has high valuations. Item 1 (value 99) and Item 4 (value 95) are very high for Agent 1. However, since Item 4 is already assigned to Agent 0, we will assign Item 2 (value 66) instead.

3. **Agent 2**: Assign the items where Agent 2 has relatively high valuations. Item 0 (value 21) and Item 3 (value 83) are good choices, but since Item 3 is already assigned to Agent 0, we will assign Item 1 (value 11) instead.

Here is a possible allocation ensuring each agent gets items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 0

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
