Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  78  59  91  57
1  41  28  34  39  44
2  98  35  25  55  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. First, identify the highest value for each item across all agents to maximize overall satisfaction.
2. Assign items based on these highest values such that each agent gets a fair share, considering their valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 78.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 59.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 44.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the agents receive items they value highly.
