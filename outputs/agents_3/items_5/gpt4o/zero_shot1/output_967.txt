Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  38  22  96  37
1  39   9  30  95  86
2  10  39  59  50  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize overall satisfaction. One common method is to use a greedy approach or an optimization technique to distribute the items. Let's see how this can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 31.
   - Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Agent 2 values it at 10.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 9.
   - Agent 2 values it at 39.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Agent 2 values it at 59.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Agent 2 values it at 50.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37.
   - Agent 1 values it at 86.
   - Agent 2 values it at 44.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

Based on the above allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
