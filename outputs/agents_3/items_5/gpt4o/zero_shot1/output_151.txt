Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  56  20  51   1
1  41  60  19  79   6
2  11  48  20  27  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences, given that each agent may have different valuations for different items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 1

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 79
  - Item 4: 6

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 27
  - Item 4: 79

Let's aim to allocate the items such that we maximize satisfaction for each agent based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item the most at 79.
2. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values this item the most at 79.
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item highly at 56.
4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item at 48, which is their second highest valuation.
5. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values this item equally to Agent 0, but Agent 0 has already received two items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value the most, Agent 1 the item they value the most, and Agent 2 the items they value the most, ensuring a fair distribution based on preferences.
