Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  29  89  51  51
1   9  88   3  73  21
2  25  26  39  79  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We will consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them in a way that seems most equitable. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify top valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (89).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (85).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent initially:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 0 and 3.
   - Check which agents value these items next highest after their initial allocations.

4. **Consider remaining items and their values:**
   - For item 0:
     - Agent 0 values it at 18.
     - Agent 1 values it at 9.
     - Agent 2 values it at 25.
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 51.
     - Agent 1 values it at 73.
     - Agent 2 values it at 79.

5. **Allocate remaining items to maximize fairness:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 because they value it the highest (79).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 as well, since after getting item 3, they still have a higher valuation for item 0 (25) compared to what other agents have already received.

Thus, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed considering each agent's preferences.
