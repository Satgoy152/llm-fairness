Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  97  91  28  53
1  14  70  55  16  76
2  87  93  24  72  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 70 55 16 76]
 [87 93 24 72 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items: [20, 97, 91, 28, 53]
- Agent 1 values the items: [14, 70, 55, 16, 76]
- Agent 2 values the items: [87, 93, 24, 72, 13]

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (97), and the second highest is item 2 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (93), but since item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can give a second preference, item 0 (87).

Now let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 1 (97) and item 3 (28) - Total value = 97 + 28 = 125
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (76) - Total value = 76
3. **Agent 2**: Item 0 (87) and item 2 (24) - Total value = 87 + 24 = 111

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the satisfaction based on the values provided.

Now, let's format this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items that they value relatively highly, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
