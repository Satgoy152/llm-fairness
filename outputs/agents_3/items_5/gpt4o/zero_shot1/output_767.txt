Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  98  33  80  24
1  48  85  76  47  58
2  37  10  31  19  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 85 76 47 58]
 [37 10 31 19 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to assign items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of all agents. One common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives or tries to balance the values received as evenly as possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [44, 98, 33, 80, 24]
- Agent 1 values: [48, 85, 76, 47, 58]
- Agent 2 values: [37, 10, 31, 19, 42]

We can try to allocate the items such that each agent gets items they value highly, and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 1 (98) and 3 (80)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 2 (76) and 1 (85)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 4 (42) and 0 (37)

To avoid conflicts:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it's their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it's the next highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it highly and it hasn't been assigned yet.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it's their next highest valued unassigned item.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while giving each agent some of the items they value highly.
