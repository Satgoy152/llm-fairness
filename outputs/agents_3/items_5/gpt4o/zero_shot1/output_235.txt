Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  63  10  80  90
1  51  43  96  97  93
2  61  86  90  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by each agent and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4. Let's allocate these items to Agent 1 since they have the highest preference for them.

2. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 and 3, but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we check the next preferred items. Let's give Agent 2 item 1.

3. **Agent 0** has a relatively high valuation for item 0, making it the best candidate for that item.

Following this allocation plan, we have:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their preferences, maximizing their total valuation.
