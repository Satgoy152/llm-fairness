Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  75   9  98  55
1  61  68  74  14  98
2  91  44  37  78  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We'll aim for an allocation where each agent gets at least one item and the total value of items for each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (98)
   - Second choice considering balancing: Item 0 (43)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (98)
   - Second choice considering balancing: Item 2 (74)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (91, but given to Agent 0)
   - Second choice considering balancing: Item 1 (44)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is balanced according to their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
