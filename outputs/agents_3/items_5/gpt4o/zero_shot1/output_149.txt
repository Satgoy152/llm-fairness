Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  44   5  79   0
1  33  34   2  23  86
2  17  96  56  60  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 34  2 23 86]
 [17 96 56 60 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's evaluate the best allocation strategy:

Agent 0's valuations: [19, 44, 5, 79, 0]  
Agent 1's valuations: [33, 34, 2, 23, 86]  
Agent 2's valuations: [17, 96, 56, 60, 40]

Let's begin by assigning each item to the agent who values it most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 33, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 96, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 56, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 79, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 86, which is the highest.

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed based on the highest valuation while also distributing all 5 items across the agents.

Here are the allocations in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
