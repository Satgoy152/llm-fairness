Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  36  17  59  65
1  56  48  37  75  20
2  85  62  85  49  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's evaluate and assign the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 
     - Item 0: 99
     - Item 4: 65

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items:
     - Item 3: 75
     - Item 1: 48

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items:
     - Item 2: 85
     - Item 0: 85
   
Based on the above valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 0** because they value it the highest (99).
- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 1** because they value it the highest (75).
- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 2** because they value it the highest (85).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 4):

- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 0** because their second-highest preference is 36.
- Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 2** since they value it reasonably high (76) after their top choice.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
