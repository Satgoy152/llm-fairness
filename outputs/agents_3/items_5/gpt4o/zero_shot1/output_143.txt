Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  48  44  57  30
1  29  11  29  97  47
2  10  54  39  30  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 54 39 30 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. We will also aim for a balanced distribution of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [9, 48, 44, 57, 30]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [29, 11, 29, 97, 47]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [10, 54, 39, 30, 71]

To allocate these items, we can observe the highest value items for each agent and distribute them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values for Agent 0: Item 3 (57), Item 1 (48), Item 2 (44)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values for Agent 1: Item 3 (97), Item 4 (47), Item 0 (29)
   - Since Item 3 is already allocated, give Agent 1 the next highest value, Item 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values for Agent 2: Item 4 (71), Item 1 (54), Item 2 (39)
   - Since Item 4 is already allocated, give Agent 2 the next highest value, Item 1

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Items remaining: 0, 2

4. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (29) as it maximizes value for Agent 1 among the remaining items.
5. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (44), maximizing value for Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Items 3 and 2
- Agent 1 gets Items 4 and 0
- Agent 2 gets Item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
