Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  32  38  36  72
1   5  76  76  70  68
2  33  40  12  75  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value for item 4 (72).
   - Agent 1: Highest values for items 1 and 2 (76 each).
   - Agent 2: Highest value for item 3 (75).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0 and 2 are left to be allocated.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 more than item 0 (38 vs. 9).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (76) more than item 0 (5).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 (33) more than item 2 (12).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it maximizes value.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 because it gives them a reasonable value compared to other options.

5. **Check Allocations:**
   - Each agent has at least one item.
   - All items are allocated.

Following this approach, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
