Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78   1   6  23  15
1  53  32  35   4   7
2  88  26  14  27  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items to the 3 agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by assigning items they value the most. We also ensure all items are allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
    - Highest valued item: 0 (value 78)
    - Second highest: 3 (value 23)

2. **Agent 1:**
    - Highest valued item: 2 (value 35)
    - Second highest: 1 (value 32)

3. **Agent 2:**
    - Highest valued item: 4 (value 70)

Following this strategy, we allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2
- Agent 2 gets item 4

This results in the following JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and that all items are distributed.
