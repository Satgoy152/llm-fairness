Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  85  24  30   7
1   9  92  15  28  37
2  92  99   7  93  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 92 15 28 37]
 [92 99  7 93 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations. We will try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as high as possible, given the constraints.

### Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  85  24  30   7
1   9  92  15  28  37
2  92  99   7  93  63
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 66, 85, 24, 30, 7
   - Highest Value: Item 1 (85), Item 0 (66)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 9, 92, 15, 28, 37
   - Highest Value: Item 1 (92)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 92, 99, 7, 93, 63
   - Highest Value: Item 1 (99), Item 3 (93), Item 0 (92)

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest value for Item 1 (99), allocate Item 1.
  - Next highest value for Item 3 (93), allocate Item 3.
  
- **Agent 0**: 
  - With Item 1 allocated to Agent 2, pick next highest: Item 0 (66), allocate Item 0.

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest remaining value is Item 4 (37), allocate Item 4.

- **Agent 0**:
  - Allocate remaining Item 2 (24) to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest valuations and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
