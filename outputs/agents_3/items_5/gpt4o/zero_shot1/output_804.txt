Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  54  97  17   3
1  18  11  12  12  42
2  26  23  67  16  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [26 23 67 16 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. Let's analyze the given valuations and decide on an optimal allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 3

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 42

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 27

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 2 (97), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 4 (42), so we allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for Item 0 (26), but Agent 0 values it the highest at 59, so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 2 values Item 1 at 23, which is the highest among the remaining items for them, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
5. Finally, we have Item 3 left, which Agent 0 values at 17 and Agent 2 at 16. As Agent 0 already has 2 items and Agent 2 has only 1, we allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 to ensure fairness.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing individual valuations where possible.
