Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  46  43  87  45
1  36  83  76  11   7
2  61  12  97   8   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value each agent receives. This involves examining the valuations each agent has for the items and attempting to distribute them in a way that is optimal for all parties involved.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2, but since it is less than Agent 1's total valuation, we allocate item 4 to this agent as it is not highly valued by others.

Following this strategy, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

This allocation attempts to give each agent the items they value most highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
