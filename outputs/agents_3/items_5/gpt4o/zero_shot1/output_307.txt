Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  25  74  53  99
1  75  16  51  33  60
2  11   4  75  81   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [11  4 75 81  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or trying to balance the value distribution if not all agents can receive items due to the constraints.

Let's analyze the table to determine an optimal allocation:

```
Agent 0: Values = [18, 25, 74, 53, 99]
Agent 1: Values = [75, 16, 51, 33, 60]
Agent 2: Values = [11, 4, 75, 81, 1]
```

A possible approach is to assign items based on maximizing individual agent's values for fairness:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (99) and item 2 (74).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (75) and item 4 (60).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (81) and item 2 (75).

Let's try to allocate based on these preferences while ensuring no item is assigned more than once:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest individual value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest individual value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest individual value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0, and Agent 2 already has item 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (next available item with some value).

This allocation ensures each agent receives almost equal importance based on their valuation preferences, subject to the constraint that all items are assigned. Let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
