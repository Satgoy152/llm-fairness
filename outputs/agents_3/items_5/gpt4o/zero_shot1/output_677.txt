Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  76  45  39  40
1  99  12  63  75  53
2  24  19  45  24  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their overall satisfaction, one common approach is to assign items based on each agent's highest valuations. However, we must ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations:

1. Identify each agent's highest-valued item and allocate it if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Make sure that the total number of allocated items is exactly 5.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a value of 76.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a value of 99.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most with a value of 61.

Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [4]

Now, we have 2 more items (2, 3) to allocate. Let's assign the remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

- Agent 1 values item 3 highly with a value of 75.
- Agent 2 values item 2 with a value of 45.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 2]

This allocation distributes all 5 items among the agents fairly based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
