Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  33  70  20  66
1  81  99  73  39  73
2  22   9  72   3  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total value each agent receives, we can use an approach that involves examining the valuations and distributing items to agents based on their highest preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. First, we look for the highest valuation for each item across all agents and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. We ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 81.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 99.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 70.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest at 39.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 66.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 2 receives no items. 

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
