Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  84  69  83   7
1  15  68  14  99  49
2  23  79  78  78   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them accordingly. Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: 81, 84, 69, 83, 7
   - Highest values are for items 1 and 3.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: 15, 68, 14, 99, 49
   - Highest value is for item 3, followed by items 1 and 4.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: 23, 79, 78, 78, 6
   - Highest values are for items 1 and 2.

Considering the above, here's one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 3. These are among the highest values for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4. This is the highest remaining valued item for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1 and 2. These are the highest valued items for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and only five items are allocated in total.

The allocations in the required JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
