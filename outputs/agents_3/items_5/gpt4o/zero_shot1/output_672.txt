Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  51  48  70  18
1   8  14  64  52  49
2  77  86  83  38  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 86 83 38 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a technique to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum assignment" problem, which aims to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

```
Agent 0: 90, 51, 48, 70, 18
Agent 1:  8, 14, 64, 52, 49
Agent 2: 77, 86, 83, 38, 16
```

We should aim to assign items to the agents such that the sum of the valuations of the assigned items is maximized.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Assign item 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the most (90), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Assign item 1:** Agent 2 values item 1 the most (86), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Assign item 2:** Agent 2 values item 2 the most (83), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Assign item 3:** Agent 0 values item 3 the most (70), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Assign item 4:** Agent 1 values item 4 the most (49), so assign item 4 to agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: item [4]
- Agent 2: items [1, 2]

By following these steps, all items have been allocated, and we have maximized the total valuation.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
