Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  99  48  41  89
1  66  55  82  95  30
2  11  22  26  63  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 89.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 99.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 82.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 95.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 89.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Now, we ensure all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: No items

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
