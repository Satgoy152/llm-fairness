Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  49  41  99  92
1  53  73  20  19  78
2  74  34  55  16  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, taking into consideration the different valuations each agent has for the items. Since we have 3 agents and 5 items, we can try to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a high total value, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Here are the steps for a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 4. Allocating these items to Agent 0 will give them a high total value.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1, so we can allocate it to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 2. Allocating these to Agent 2 will maximize their total value.

Based on this approach, the allocations could be:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the agents while considering the high valuations each agent has for certain items. Now, let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
