Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  48  87  80  75
1  45  76  46  13  60
2  40  84  51  36   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we look at the agents' preferences for each item. Our goal is to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here are the steps to reach a fair allocation:

1. **Assess Preferences:** Review the valuation table to determine which items each agent values the most.
2. **Initial Allocation:** Attempt to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring no agent receives more items than necessary.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If conflicts arise, consider reallocating items to ensure each agent's overall satisfaction is maximized.

Let's work through the allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valued items: 2 (87), 0 (80), 3 (80)
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valued items: 1 (76), 4 (60), 2 (46)
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valued items: 1 (84), 2 (51), 0 (40)
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have items 3 and 4 left to allocate:

- **Unallocated Items:**
  - Consider the remaining items 3 and 4.
  - Agent 0 values item 3 at 80 and item 4 at 75.
  - Agent 1 values item 3 at 13 and item 4 at 60.
  - Agent 2 values item 3 at 36 and item 4 at 4.

Based on the remaining preferences:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation that fairly satisfies each agent's preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

With this allocation, each item is allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
