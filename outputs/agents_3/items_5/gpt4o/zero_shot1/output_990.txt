Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  70  79   8  52
1  39  90  59  59  11
2  49  21  82   6  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step fair allocation:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent places on an item:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value 79)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 90)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (value 82)

2. Allocate the highest valued item to each agent if possible:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1
   - Agent 2 initially gets Item 2, but it is already allocated to Agent 0. Therefore, Agent 2 will choose the next highest value, which is Item 0 (value 49).

3. Allocate the remaining items:
   - Items left: 3, 4
   - Agent 0 can choose Item 4 (value 52)
   - Agent 1 can choose Item 3 (value 59)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
