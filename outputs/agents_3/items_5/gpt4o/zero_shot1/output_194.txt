Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  28  83  87  56
1  19  92  78  24  30
2  79  99  96  96  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [79 99 96 96 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints, here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [92, 28, 83, 87, 56]
   - Highest valuation item: 0 (value: 92)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [19, 92, 78, 24, 30]
   - Highest valuation item: 1 (value: 92)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuations: [79, 99, 96, 96, 56]
   - Highest valuation item: 2 (value: 99)

After assigning the highest valuation item to each agent, we allocate the remaining items based on the remaining highest valuations:

- Remaining items: 3, 4
- Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for items 3, 4 (both valued at 96).

Thus, the allocations can be:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 3, and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 5.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
