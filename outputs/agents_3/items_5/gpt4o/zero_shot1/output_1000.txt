Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  37   6  86   9
1  35  55  69   5  95
2  91  44  68  56  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. We'll consider the valuations and try to allocate items to agents such that their total valuation is reasonably balanced. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 3 is valued at 86, which is the highest value for Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is valued at 42, which is the next highest value for Agent 0.
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Item 4 is valued at 95, which is the highest value for Agent 1.
   - Item 2 is valued at 69, which is the next highest value for Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 1 is valued at 44, which is a reasonable allocation for Agent 2 given the remaining items.

Let's see the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 1. 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
