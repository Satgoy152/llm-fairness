Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  73  65  89  56
1  72  37  58  69  32
2  44  71  94  55   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 37 58 69 32]
 [44 71 94 55  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We can use a simple greedy approach to achieve this.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [74, 73, 65, 89, 56]
- Agent 1: [72, 37, 58, 69, 32]
- Agent 2: [44, 71, 94, 55, 3]

Let's assign the items one by one to the agent who values them the most:

1. Item 3 should go to Agent 0 (value 89).
2. Item 2 should go to Agent 2 (value 94).
3. Item 0 should go to Agent 0 (value 74).
4. Item 1 should go to Agent 2 (value 71).
5. Item 4 should go to Agent 0 (value 56).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. If any agent does not have an item, we can reassign the least valuable item from an agent with more than one item.

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 has items [3, 0, 4]
- Agent 2 has items [2, 1]
- Agent 1 has no items.

To ensure fairness, let's reassign item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1. Now each agent has at least one item.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [3, 0]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2, 1]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
