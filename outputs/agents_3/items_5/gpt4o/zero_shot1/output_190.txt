Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  35  32  25  48
1  35  25  45  11  30
2  68   0  30  79  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's a plausible allocation based on the given values:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 with a value of 68 is the highest value for Agent 0.
   - Item 4 with a value of 48 is the second highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 with a value of 45 is the highest value for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 with a value of 79 is the highest value for Agent 2.
   - Item 1 with a value of 0 is chosen over any other items because the other items have been allocated, and this ensures a fair allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
