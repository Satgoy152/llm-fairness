Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  75  15  71  34
1  59  74  11  33  79
2  72  20  42  96  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can adopt a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given that we have three agents and five items, we can allocate items in such a way that each agent gets roughly the most valuable items available to them.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High valuations for items 0 (86), 3 (71), and 1 (75).
   - Let's allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations for items 4 (79) and 1 (74).
   - Since item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations for items 3 (96) and 0 (72).
   - Since item 0 is allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, item 2 remains unallocated. Let's determine the best fit for item 2:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 at 15.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 at 11.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 at 42.

Given these, item 2 should be allocated to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
