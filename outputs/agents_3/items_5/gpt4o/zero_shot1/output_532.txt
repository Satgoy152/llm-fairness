Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  35  83  97   2
1  13  16  46  97  33
2  24  41  73  56  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations agents have for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can attempt a simple approach to balance the distribution of the most valued items among the agents.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest preferences for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 2 (83), Item 0 (66), Item 1 (35), Item 4 (2)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 2 (46), Item 4 (33), Item 1 (16), Item 0 (13)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 2 (73), Item 3 (56), Item 1 (41), Item 0 (24)

From these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 3** is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. Since both have the highest value for this item, allocate it to one of them. Let's give it to Agent 0.
  
- **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 2, so allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

- **Item 2** is the next highly valued item. Both Agent 0 and Agent 2 have high valuations for it, but since Agent 2 already has an item, allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

- **Item 0** has a high value for Agent 0 and is not yet allocated, but since Agent 0 already has two items, consider Agent 1. However, Agent 1 values it the least. Let's consider reallocating for balance:

  - Allocate **Item 0** to Agent 1.

- **Item 1** is the remaining item, which Agent 2 values more than Agent 1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations with some balance are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that items are distributed fairly based on the agents' preferences and the need to allocate all items.
