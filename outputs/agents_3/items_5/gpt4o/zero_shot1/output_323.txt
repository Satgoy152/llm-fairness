Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  94  65  99  52
1  46  63  75  27  76
2  23   4  44  71  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's evaluate a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Therefore, we can allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively high valuations for item 2 and item 4. Thus, we can allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** will receive item 0, as it has the least impact on the valuations for other agents.

This allocation distributes the items while attempting to maximize the fairness based on the agents' valuations. Here is how the allocations look:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all five items are distributed.
