Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  31  48   4  76
1  18  65  54  76  46
2  28  80  45  17  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 80 45 17 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values: [71, 31, 48, 4, 76]
- Agent 1 values: [18, 65, 54, 76, 46]
- Agent 2 values: [28, 80, 45, 17, 73]

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 71.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 80.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 54.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 76.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 76.

This allocation respects the constraint that a total of 5 items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
