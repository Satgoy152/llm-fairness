Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  46  30  29  85
1  34  46  80   3  19
2  30  47   4  12  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations for each item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (95), 4 (85)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: 2 (80)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Next highest value items: 1 (47), 3 (12)

We aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here's a possible allocation based on the above considerations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4 (values: 95, 85)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value: 80)
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 3 (values: 47, 12)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while distributing the items fairly among the agents.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
