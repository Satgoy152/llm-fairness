Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  63  89  31  44
1  26   5  55  92  75
2  75  59  73  24  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. We can use a simple approach to achieve this by considering the highest valued items for each agent and balancing the remaining allocations.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [53, 63, 89, 31, 44]
Agent 1: [26, 5, 55, 92, 75]
Agent 2: [75, 59, 73, 24, 85]
```

We will allocate items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction, ensuring a fair distribution.

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (89)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (92)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (85)

2. Allocate the remaining items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction:
   - The remaining items are 0 and 1.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 75).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 63).

The allocations are as follows:

Agent 0: Items [1, 2]  
Agent 1: Item [3]  
Agent 2: Items [0, 4]  

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
