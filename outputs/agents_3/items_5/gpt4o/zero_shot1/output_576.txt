Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  98   7  96  17
1  67  95  88  20  26
2  12  72   0  87  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (98), Item 3 (96)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (95), Item 2 (88)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (92), Item 3 (87)

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Start with the highest value for any agent and assign that item to the corresponding agent.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets a Fair Share:**
   - Since there are 5 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should get at least 1 item, with one agent getting 2 items (since 5 items split among 3 agents).

4. **Propose Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Assign Item 1 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Agent 1: Assign Item 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 1)
   - Agent 2: Assign Item 4 (highest remaining value for Agent 2)
   - Agent 0: Assign Item 3 (next highest value for Agent 0)
   - Agent 1: Assign Item 0 (next highest value for Agent 1)

5. **Review and Finalize Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has Items 1, 3
   - Agent 1 has Items 2, 0
   - Agent 2 has Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible with the given valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```
