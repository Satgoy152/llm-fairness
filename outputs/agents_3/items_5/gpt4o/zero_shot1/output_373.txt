Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  10  34  96  59
1  68  40  18  10   8
2  61  58  50  67  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate the items** based on the highest values:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 68.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 58.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 34.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 69.

3. **Check for balance**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and every item is allocated.

With this approach, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items they highly value.
