Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  25  10  43  66
1  17  93  66  33  69
2  66  88  49   9  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (66)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (93)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (90) but already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest value: Item 1 (88) but already taken by Agent 1.
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (66)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items.

4. **Consider remaining items:** Items 2 and 3 are still unallocated.
   - Item 2:
     - Agent 1 values it at 66.
     - Agent 2 values it at 49.
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (higher value).

   - Item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 43.
     - Agent 1 values it at 33.
     - Agent 2 values it at 9.
     - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (higher value).

Based on this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is made to maximize each agent's total value based on their individual preferences.
