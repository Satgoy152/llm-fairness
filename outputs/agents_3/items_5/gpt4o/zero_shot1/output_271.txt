Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  92  49  52  74
1  21  70  31  75  46
2  66  46   2  29  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are 92 (Item 1), 74 (Item 4), and 52 (Item 3).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are 75 (Item 3), 70 (Item 1), and 46 (Item 4).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are 66 (Item 0), 46 (Item 1), and 29 (Item 3).

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Start by allocating items that are uniquely highest valued to one agent:
     - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 92 and Agent 1 at 70, Agent 2 at 46. Allocate to Agent 0.
     - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 75 and Agent 0 at 52, Agent 2 at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
     - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 66 and Agent 0 at 48, Agent 1 at 21. Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 2 and 4.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 46, and Agent 2 at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 31, and Agent 2 at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Check Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 2 (Total valuation = 92 + 74 + 49 = 215)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (Total valuation = 75)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (Total valuation = 66)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their total valuations. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all five items among the agents, considering their highest valuations.
