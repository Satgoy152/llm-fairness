Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  35  95  89  62
1  65  70  95  56  43
2  84  71  70  42  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations. We can achieve this by trying to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 65, and Agent 2 at 84.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 70, and Agent 2 at 71.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 95, and Agent 2 at 70.
   - Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value Item 2 equally, but to balance the allocation, we can assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 56, and Agent 2 at 42.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 43, and Agent 2 at 60.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, we have:
- Agent 0 receives Items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 1.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
