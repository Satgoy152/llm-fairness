Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  50  69  29  60
1  84  73  83  10  14
2   6  50  12  90  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuations for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (99).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (83).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (90).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. Now we are left with items 1 and 4.

5. **For item 1:**
   - Agent 0: 50
   - Agent 1: 73
   - Agent 2: 50
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (since 73 is the highest).

6. **For item 4:**
   - Agent 0: 60
   - Agent 1: 14
   - Agent 2: 17
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (since 60 is the highest).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation based on the given values.
