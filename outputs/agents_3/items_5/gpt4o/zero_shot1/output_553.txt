Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  27  59  26  35
1  85  81  30  95  21
2  32  20  83  56  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets approximately the same number of items.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [99, 27, 59, 26, 35]
- Agent 1: [85, 81, 30, 95, 21]
- Agent 2: [32, 20, 83, 56, 62]

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (81).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (83).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (95).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (62).

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair, with each agent getting an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 4.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable distribution based on their preferences, with Agent 1 receiving two items due to strong preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
