Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  27  40  34  47
1  81  87  55  17  63
2  31  17  77  29  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their given valuations, we need to consider each agent's preference and the total number of items available. A common approach is to try to maximize the total valuation, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 65), which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item. Therefore, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 87), and also has a high valuation for item 2 (value 55). Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 81), which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item. Therefore, allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - For the remaining item, item 3, Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation (value 34), but since Agent 2 has only one item, allocate item 3 to Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
