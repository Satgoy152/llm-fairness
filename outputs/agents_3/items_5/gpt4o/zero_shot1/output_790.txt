Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  40  91  99  14
1  16  89  83  46  56
2  45   3  47  31  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 14

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 46
  - Item 4: 56

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 10

To allocate fairly, we will try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to one agent only.

Let's start with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for Item 3 (99) and Item 2 (91). Let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for Item 1 (89) and Item 2 (83). Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has relatively lower valuations, but we can give them the remaining items while considering their preferences to some extent.

Continuing with the allocation:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 as they value it highly.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2, since it has a decent value of 45 for them.
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 as they value it at 56, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation for any remaining item.

Based on this reasoning, here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
