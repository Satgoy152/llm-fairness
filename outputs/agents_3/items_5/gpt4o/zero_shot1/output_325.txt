Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  13  39  32  60
1   7  18  24  81  12
2  57   1  61   8  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [57  1 61  8 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall value. Let's examine the table to determine the best allocation strategy:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  13  39  32  60
1   7  18  24  81  12
2  57   1  61   8  42
```

We'll aim to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with what they receive and the total value is maximized across all agents.

1. **Agent 0** values items 0, 2, and 4 highly (33, 39, and 60).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (81).
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 and 2 highly (57 and 61).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0** gets item 4 (60), which is the highest valuation for this item.
- **Agent 1** gets item 3 (81), which is the highest valuation for this item.
- **Agent 2** gets items 0 and 2 (57 and 61), which are highly valued by this agent.
- **Agent 0** gets item 1 as it has the next highest value (13) compared to other agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall value is distributed fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
