Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  20  42  81  26
1  37  74  90  49  21
2  63  64   4  16  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We'll consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute them in a way that optimizes overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 26

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 49
  - Item 4: 21

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 53

To maximize fairness, we can use a simple approach where we assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations and try to distribute the total fairly:

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (81).
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values it the most (64).

Now, we have two items left to distribute (Items 0 and 4):

4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values it decently (70), and it adds to their total value, maximizing their benefit.
5. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values it more than Agent 1 (53 vs. 21).

With these assignments, let's check the total values:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 3: Total value = 70 + 81 = 151
- Agent 1 gets Item 2: Total value = 90
- Agent 2 gets Items 1 and 4: Total value = 64 + 53 = 117

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are fairly distributed. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
