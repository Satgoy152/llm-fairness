Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  85  15  87  45
1  17  24  64  70  23
2  51  79  56   8  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and each item is allocated only once. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0 (87).
   - Item 4 has a reasonable value (45) compared to other agents.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (64).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 2 (79).
   - Item 0 has a reasonable value (51) compared to other agents.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair portion of the total value based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
