Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  16  20  11  18
1  48  42  68  89   2
2  39  91  53  25  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can approach this problem using a method that tries to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [89, 16, 20, 11, 18]
- Agent 1: [48, 42, 68, 89, 2]
- Agent 2: [39, 91, 53, 25, 85]

To allocate fairly, we should attempt to allocate the highest valued items to the respective agents:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 89, which is the highest among all agents.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 91, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 68, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 89, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 85, which is the highest.

Based on the above analysis, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
