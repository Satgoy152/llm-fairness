Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  13  35  53  31
1   8   8  31  26   3
2  81  73  49  59  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated exactly once. We'll do this by considering each agent's valuation of the items and trying to distribute the items such that overall, the assignment is as fair as possible.

Let's analyze the table:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 80
- Item 1: 13
- Item 2: 35
- Item 3: 53
- Item 4: 31

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 8
- Item 1: 8
- Item 2: 31
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 3

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 73
- Item 2: 49
- Item 3: 59
- Item 4: 78

We will assign the items to the agents based on maximizing their individual valuations.

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (max value 81).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (max value 73).
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (max value 78).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (max value 53).
5. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (max value 35).

Agent 1 will not receive any items in this allocation, as the valuations are significantly lower than the others, making it difficult to justify an item allocation compared to others.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
