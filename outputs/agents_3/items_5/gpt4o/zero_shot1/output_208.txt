Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  18  21  79  99
1  26  97  61  34  61
2  91  76  92  66  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuation for item 4.

Based on these valuations, here's a fair allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation of 91.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation of 97.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation of 92.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation of 79.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation of 99.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of their highest-valued items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is based on maximizing individual agent valuations.
