Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  82  42  40  11
1  57  90  90  79  65
2  58   9  66  51  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 90 90 79 65]
 [58  9 66 51 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations and try to allocate the items:

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-----------|-------------------
    0      | 67  82  42  40  11
    1      | 57  90  90  79  65
    2      | 58   9  66  51  70
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest (82).
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 and 2 value it equally (90), but Agent 1 values more items highly, so allocate to Agent 1 for balance.
3. **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 2 (58), as Agent 0 has been prioritized for another high-value item.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest (79).
5. **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 2 (70), the highest valuation for remaining items after allocating items 3.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while respecting their individual preferences.
