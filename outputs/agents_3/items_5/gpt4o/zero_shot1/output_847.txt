Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  89  21  64  32
1  26  51  87  78  14
2  71  64  89  15  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [71 64 89 15 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. We have to ensure that each agent receives at least one item because there are three agents and five items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item starting with the highest value item for each agent.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

Let's proceed with this approach.

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (89), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (87), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (89), but since item 2 is already taken, assign item 0 to agent 2 as it's the next highest value (71).

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
- Remaining items are 3 and 4.
- Agent 0: Value of item 3 (64), item 4 (32)
- Agent 1: Value of item 3 (78), item 4 (14)
- Agent 2: Value of item 3 (15), item 4 (45)

Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 78) because it maximizes the value for the remaining items and item 4 to agent 2 (value 45).

### Final Allocation

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total value to each agent is maximized given the constraints.
