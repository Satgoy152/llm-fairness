Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9   5   3  90   6
1  13   6  43  79  93
2  61  32  80  98  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively low valuations for items, but item 0 is one of the lower-valued items overall.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 3, and a decent valuation for item 1.

Given these observations, a potential fair allocation is:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2, as they have very high valuations for these.
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as these are the lesser valued items by the other agents.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
