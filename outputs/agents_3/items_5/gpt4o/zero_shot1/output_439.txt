Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  20  32   5  80
1  87  72  27  53  70
2  27  13  41  58  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: [80, 20, 32, 5, 80]
- Agent 1: [87, 72, 27, 53, 70]
- Agent 2: [27, 13, 41, 58, 86]

We can start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 41.
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 58.
5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 86.

After initial allocation, the distribution is:
- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 4]

However, Agent 0 has no items, and we need to ensure a fair allocation. Let's re-evaluate:

Re-allocate:
- Item 0 can go to Agent 0 since they value it highly at 80. 
- Item 1 remains with Agent 1.
- Item 2 remains with Agent 2.
- Item 3 remains with Agent 2.
- Item 4 can go to Agent 0 since they also value it highly at 80.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

This ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent receives items they value fairly highly. The allocation is balanced and considers the valuations.

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
