Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  37  37  77  70
1  70  16  46  56  43
2  29  81  40  51  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [29 81 40 51 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's valuations:

- Agent 0: [29, 37, 37, 77, 70]
- Agent 1: [70, 16, 46, 56, 43]
- Agent 2: [29, 81, 40, 51, 34]

We'll allocate based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction for their most valued items:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (81).
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (77).
3. **Agent 0** also values item 4 at 70, which is higher than the others.
4. **Agent 1** values item 0 at 70, which is highest compared to other agents.
5. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 2 (46).

This allocation ensures each agent gets their highest valued items available, and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [1]

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
