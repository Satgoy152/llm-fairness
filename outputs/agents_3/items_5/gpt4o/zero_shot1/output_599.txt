Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  97  54  32  47
1  52  62  96  44  26
2  78  40  40  22  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. We will use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. **Assign Items to Agents:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 72
  - Agent 1 values it at 52
  - Agent 2 values it at 78 (highest)
  
  Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 97 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values it at 62
  - Agent 2 values it at 40

  Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 54
  - Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 40

  Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 32
  - Agent 1 values it at 44 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 22

  Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 47 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values it at 26
  - Agent 2 values it at 54 (highest)

  Assign Item 4 to Agent 2. Since both Agents 2 and 0 have high valuations for this item, we can choose either. For balance, let's allocate it to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
