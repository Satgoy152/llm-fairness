Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  70  33  36  53
1   0  84  61  65  82
2  36  72  43  13   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 36
  - Item 4: 53

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 82

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 6

A fair allocation should consider maximizing the value each agent gets. One approach is to allocate the items to the agent who values them the most. Here's how we can do that:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (97).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (84).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (61).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (65).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (82).

Now, considering fairness and distribution, we'll try to distribute items so that each agent gets a non-zero number of items if possible, without exceeding 5 items in total.

Let's adjust allocations to ensure fairness:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (Agent 1 values it highly, and it balances the distribution).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes the items based on their highest valuations while ensuring fairness.
