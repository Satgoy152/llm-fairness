Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47   5   4  30  25
1  40  61  58   5  32
2  29  48  83  24  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's assess the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 30
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 5
  - Item 4: 32

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 24
  - Item 4: 83

To maximize fairness, we can allocate based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 47 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 61 by Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 83 by Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 30 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 83 by Agent 2.

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items, Agent 1 one item, and Agent 2 two items, which is a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
