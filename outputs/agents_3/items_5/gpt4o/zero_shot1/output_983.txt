Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  89  47  66  11
1  50  85  21   3  59
2   8  91  22  35  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 91 22 35 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed. We will consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to allocate accordingly, maintaining fairness and ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (60), 1 (89), and 3 (66).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 (50), 1 (85), and 4 (59).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 (91) and 4 (43).

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 91. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 60. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 66, which is higher than any other agent. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item at 59, which is the highest among the agents. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item at 47, which is higher than any other agent. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items according to their valuations as best as possible, while all items are distributed.
