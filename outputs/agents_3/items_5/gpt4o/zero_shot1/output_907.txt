Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  62  51  12  10
1  18  92  95  17  82
2  75  25  66  38  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [75 25 66 38 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations in the table, we will attempt to assign items such that the highest value for each item is assigned to the corresponding agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it highly at 82.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it at 75, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for item 0.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it at 62, which is higher than agent 2's valuation, and agent 1 has already received two items.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it higher than agent 0 and agent 1.

Now, each agent has received an allocation, and all items have been assigned. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
