Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97   3  91  52  51
1  39  83   2  71  98
2   4  38  96  20  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent**:
    - Agent 0 has high values for items 0 (97) and 2 (91).
    - Agent 1 has high values for items 4 (98) and 1 (83).
    - Agent 2 has high values for items 2 (96) and 4 (61).

2. **Initial allocation based on highest values**:
    - Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 97).
    - Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 98).
    - Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 96).

3. **Assign remaining items to maximize fairness**:
    - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
    - Agent 1 has a high value for item 1 (83), assign item 1 to agent 1.
    - Agent 0 has a relatively high value for item 3 (52), assign item 3 to agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items while also maximizing their total value received.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
