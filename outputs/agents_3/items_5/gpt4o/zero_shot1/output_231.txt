Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  37  69  37  52
1  94  16   8  81  88
2  78  11  54  37  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. However, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. Evaluate each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible, adjusting the allocation if needed to maintain fairness.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  37  69  37  52
1  94  16   8  81  88
2  78  11  54  37  44
```

Let's assign the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 37.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 88.

Now, checking the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4
- Agent 2 receives no items

This allocation uses all 5 items. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items, with Agent 0 receiving three, Agent 1 receiving two, and Agent 2 receiving none.
