Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  71  34  35  46
1  10  26  37  40  48
2  68  78  20  33  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One way is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but also ensure that each agent ends up with an item.

Given the valuations, let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 10, Agent 2 at 68.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 26, Agent 2 at 78.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 37, Agent 2 at 20.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 40, Agent 2 at 33.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 at 48, Agent 2 at 70.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total allocation is 5 items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
