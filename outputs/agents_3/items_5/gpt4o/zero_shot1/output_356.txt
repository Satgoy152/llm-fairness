Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  90  56  49  70
1   4   6  45  37  62
2   4  82  91  79  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4  6 45 37 62]
 [ 4 82 91 79 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

### Valuations Table:
```
    Item
    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  90  56  49  70
1   4   6  45  37  62
2   4  82  91  79  19
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 the highest. Allocating these items to Agent 0 seems the best choice to maximize their satisfaction.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values items 2 and 3 the highest. These should be allocated to Agent 2.

The allocations can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

Each agent receives a different set of items, maximizing their respective valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
