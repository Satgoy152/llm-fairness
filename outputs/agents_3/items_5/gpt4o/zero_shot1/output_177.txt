Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  59  28  14   6
1  16  37   8  93  51
2  40  87  23   5  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value that each agent receives. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4.
   - Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Agent 2 values it at 40.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Agent 2 values it at 87.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28.
   - Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Agent 2 values it at 23.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14.
   - Agent 1 values it at 93.
   - Agent 2 values it at 5.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Agent 2 values it at 35.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

Now, let's represent the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
