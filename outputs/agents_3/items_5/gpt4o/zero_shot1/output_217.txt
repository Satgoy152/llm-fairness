Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  51  47  44   8
1  55  60  75  56  48
2  63  73  22  79  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or valuation) for each agent given their preferences. We can use a simple greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, making sure each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 63
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 47
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

Now, let's check the allocations and ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 4]

The allocations result in Agent 0 receiving one item, Agent 1 receiving one item, and Agent 2 receiving three items. This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
