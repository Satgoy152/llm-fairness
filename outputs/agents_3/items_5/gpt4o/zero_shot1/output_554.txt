Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  48   9  78  62
1  87   2  66  14   4
2  27  14  35  31   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations. We can use the following strategy to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Ensure that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate each item based on the valuations:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are [84, 87, 27]. Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 1**: Valuations are [48, 2, 14]. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 2**: Valuations are [9, 66, 35]. Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 3**: Valuations are [78, 14, 31]. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 4**: Valuations are [62, 4, 5]. Agent 0 values it the most.

Based on the highest valuations, the initial allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: []

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items, Agent 1 two items, and Agent 2 none. This distribution respects the requirement to allocate all 5 items fairly based on the highest valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
