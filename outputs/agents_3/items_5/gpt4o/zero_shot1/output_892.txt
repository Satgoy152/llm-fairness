Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29   8  13  49  33
1  27  68  47  46  99
2  78  40  39  24  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation for the items. A common approach is to use a method like the "Maximum Nash Welfare" or "Envy-Free" allocation where the goal is to maximize the product of the utilities or ensure no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. However, given the constraints and simplicity of this task, let's aim for a balanced approach where each agent gets a fair share according to the highest valuations they have for certain items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (49).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation for item 4 (99).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (78).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. We have allocated 3 items, 2 more to go. Let's consider the remaining items 1 and 2:

   - For item 1:
     - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (68).
     - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

   - For item 2:
     - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (47).
     - Assign item 2 to agent 1.
   
This results in each agent having certain items that best align with their preferences, ensuring a fair distribution given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
