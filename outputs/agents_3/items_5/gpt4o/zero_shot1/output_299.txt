Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  27  75  51  17
1  24  55  88  31  94
2  44  42  77  45  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 55 88 31 94]
 [44 42 77 45 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent receives items they value relatively higher. Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: 64, 27, 75, 51, 17
- Agent 1: 24, 55, 88, 31, 94
- Agent 2: 44, 42, 77, 45, 21

We will aim to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item and the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is high.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (75).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (94).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the second most (77), but since Agent 0 already has it, we'll give them their next best, which is item 3 (45).

Now, we have allocated items 2, 3, and 4. We still need to allocate items 0 and 1.

4. **Agent 0** can take item 0 (64), which they value highly.
5. **Agent 1** can take item 1 (55), which they value more than Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and it maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
