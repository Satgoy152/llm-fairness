Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  31  29   1  19
1  30  35  11  33  88
2  53  76  90  77  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, weâ€™ll use a simple greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value for each agent.

Let's calculate the allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0 value: 19
   - Item 1 value: 31
   - Item 2 value: 29
   - Item 3 value: 1
   - Item 4 value: 19

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 value: 30
   - Item 1 value: 35
   - Item 2 value: 11
   - Item 3 value: 33
   - Item 4 value: 88

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 value: 53
   - Item 1 value: 76
   - Item 2 value: 90
   - Item 3 value: 77
   - Item 4 value: 56

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing individual agent's values:

- **Item 2** is most valuable to Agent 2 (value 90).
- **Item 4** is most valuable to Agent 1 (value 88).
- **Item 1** is next most valuable to Agent 2 (value 76).
- **Item 3** is next most valuable to Agent 2 (value 77).
- **Item 0** is most valuable to Agent 2 (value 53).

Thus, to balance the allocations fairly, we can proceed with the following allocation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Allocate **Item 2** to Agent 2.
- Allocate **Item 4** to Agent 1.
- Allocate **Item 1** to Agent 0.
- Allocate **Item 3** to Agent 1.
- Allocate **Item 0** to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to maximize the values received by each agent while ensuring an integer number of items for each.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent items based on maximizing their individual values and ensures all items are allocated.
