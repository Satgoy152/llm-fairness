Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  13  32  64  47
1  93  22  53  64  89
2  65  87  79  18  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations for each item. Given that there are 5 items and 3 agents, one possible way to allocate them is as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Given the highest value item (Item 3) to Agent 1, we look at the next highest value items for Agent 0. Items 2 and 4 are the highest valued by Agent 0 among the remaining items.
2. **Agent 1**: We already assigned Item 3, which is of high value to Agent 1. We can also assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest preference available.
3. **Agent 2**: We assign items to maximize their total value. Items 0 and 1 are the highest valued by Agent 2.

Let's check these allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1]

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that we fairly distribute the items while maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
