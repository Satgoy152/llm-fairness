Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  73  88  86   7
1   4   5   8  48  79
2  34  36   2  12  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. First, observe the highest valuations each agent has for the items:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (79).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (36).

2. Allocate these items to each respective agent:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

3. Now, consider the remaining items (2 and 3) and allocate them to maximize the total valuation:
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest (88), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest (86), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, with Agent 0 receiving more items due to their higher valuations.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
