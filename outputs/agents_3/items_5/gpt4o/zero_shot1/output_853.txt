Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  81   0  90  75
1  44  36  19  50  91
2   5  61  88  12  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can look for an allocation that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the sum of values for each agent's assigned items.

Let's examine each agent's highest-valued items to make allocations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest values: Item 3 (90), Item 1 (81), Item 0 (68)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest values: Item 4 (91), Item 3 (50), Item 0 (44)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest values: Item 2 (88), Item 1 (61), Item 4 (26)

We aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that are among their higher-valued preferences. Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Value 90)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Value 91)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (Value 88)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Value 68)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (Value 61)

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
