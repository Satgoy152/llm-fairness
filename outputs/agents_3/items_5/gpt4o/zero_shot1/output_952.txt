Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  57   2  25  84
1  45  25  84   4  15
2   1  58  20  60  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is fair, meaning each agent is satisfied with their share given the constraints. A common approach is to maximize the total value an agent receives based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [63, 57, 2, 25, 84]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [45, 25, 84, 4, 15]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [1, 58, 20, 60, 13]

To make a fair allocation, we can use a strategy where we allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 63.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 58.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 84.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 60.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 84.

Based on this allocation, we check that all agents get a fair share of items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3]

Let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
