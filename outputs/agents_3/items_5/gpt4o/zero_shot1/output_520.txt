Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  57  93  30  56
1  29  78  18   9  46
2  34  35  14  55   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [34 35 14 55  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: 40, 57, 93, 30, 56
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: 29, 78, 18, 9, 46
3. **Agent 2's valuations**: 34, 35, 14, 55, 3

A potential strategy is to allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's try to assign items one by one:

- **Item 2** (highest value for Agent 0, 93): Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** (highest value for Agent 1, 78): Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3** (highest value for Agent 2, 55): Assign to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and there are 2 items remaining (0 and 4).

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 40).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 46).

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
