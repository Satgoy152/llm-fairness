Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  10  76  25  65
1  26  99  26  60  10
2  13  71  39  87  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [13 71 39 87 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation. Given the constraints that each agent should get an integer number of items and all 5 items must be allocated, one way to approach this is to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values: [86, 10, 76, 25, 65]
- Agent 1 values: [26, 99, 26, 60, 10]
- Agent 2 values: [13, 71, 39, 87, 96]

A possible step-by-step allocation process could be:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (99), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (96), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (86), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Now, we have items 2 and 3 left to allocate.
5. **Agent 0** values item 2 (76) more than Agent 1 (26) and Agent 2 (39), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (87) compared to Agent 1 (60) and Agent 0 (25), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has been allocated items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
