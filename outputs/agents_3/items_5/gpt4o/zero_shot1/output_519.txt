Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  95  94  45   2
1  21  95  12  93  42
2  27  87  59  84  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value allocated to each agent. In this context, fairness might be interpreted as ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total valuation according to their preferences. One approach is to allocate items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible, given the constraints. Let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 1 (95), Item 2 (94)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for any agent.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 3 (93)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest valued item after Item 0.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (87), Item 3 (84), Item 2 (59)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2, as Item 1 is already allocated.

Now, we have allocated Items 0, 1, and 3. We need to allocate two more items:

4. **Remaining Items and Valuations:**
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (94), Agent 1 (12), Agent 2 (59)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (2), Agent 1 (42), Agent 2 (39)

5. Allocate Item 2:
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.

6. Allocate Item 4:
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the agents, considering their highest preferences to the extent possible.
