Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  20  32  26  66
1  85  33  18  27  24
2  10  54   2  84  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [11, 20, 32, 26, 66]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [85, 33, 18, 27, 24]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [10, 54, 2, 84, 99]

We will begin by assigning the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 1 (85).
2. Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (54).
3. Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (32).
4. Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 2 (84).
5. Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 2 (99).

However, Agent 2 cannot receive all items 1, 3, and 4 because we must distribute items among all agents as evenly as possible.

We will adjust the allocation to ensure a fair distribution:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0

This allocation allows Agent 0 to have two items, Agent 1 to have one item, and Agent 2 to have two items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
