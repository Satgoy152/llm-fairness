Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  84  38  83  59
1  47  98   9  46  38
2  47  31  86  61  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 3. Therefore, we can assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1, but since item 1 is already allocated, we can assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. For items 3 and 4, Agent 0 and Agent 2 both have relatively high valuations. We can assign item 3 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation tries to balance the distribution based on the valuations provided:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
