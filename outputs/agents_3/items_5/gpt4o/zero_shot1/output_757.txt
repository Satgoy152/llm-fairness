Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75   6  76  94  58
1  17  45  61  56  24
2  93  54  34  32  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has the highest value for item 3 (94) and item 2 (76).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has the highest value for item 1 (45).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has the highest value for item 0 (93) and item 4 (34).

Based on this strategy, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items maximizing their valuations, ensuring a fair distribution according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
