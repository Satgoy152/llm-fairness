Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  87  12  33  95
1  64  66  64  24   7
2  33  12   6  80  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can utilize a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we aim to allocate the five items such that the total valuation for every agent is as fair as possible.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: (27, 87, 12, 33, 95)
- Agent 1 values: (64, 66, 64, 24, 7)
- Agent 2 values: (33, 12, 6, 80, 29)

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Assign the highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (95). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (80). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

2. **Assign the next highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 second highest (87). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (64). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign the remaining item:**
   - Item 2 is left. Agent 1 and Agent 0 both value it reasonably (64 and 12), but Agent 1 has a higher valuation for it. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [3]

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and it attempts to maximize the satisfaction based on their valuations while distributing all 5 items.
