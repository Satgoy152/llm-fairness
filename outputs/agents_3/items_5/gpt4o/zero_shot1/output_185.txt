Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  78  11  25  53
1  47  79  59  81  38
2  97  45  21  88  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations, while ensuring each agent receives a whole number of items. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and a moderate valuation for item 4. We'll allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3. We'll allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 3 and moderate for item 0. However, since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

The allocations can be represented in the specified JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while all items are distributed.
