Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  79   0  10  16
1  83   0  79  70  82
2  57  29  31  26   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  79   0  10  16
1  83   0  79  70  82
2  57  29  31  26   4
```

A possible approach is to assign the items to the agents who value them the most, subject to the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and only 5 items are allocated in total.

Analyzing the values:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (83).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (79).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (79).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (70).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (82).

Given this, a possible allocation could be:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 2: No items

This allocation maximizes the value for Agent 1, who has the highest valuations for most items.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```
