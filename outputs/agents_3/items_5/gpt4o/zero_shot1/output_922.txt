Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  36  79  50  30
1  85  98  19  52  45
2  88  78  80  47  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Assign items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Highest: Item 2 (79), Item 3 (50), Item 0 (49)
- Agent 1 values:
  - Highest: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (85), Item 3 (52)
- Agent 2 values:
  - Highest: Item 0 (88), Item 2 (80), Item 1 (78)

Allocate items by maximizing each agent's individual valuation:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

Now, allocate the remaining items, Items 3 and 4:

- Considering remaining values:
  - Agent 0: Item 3 (50), Item 4 (30)
  - Agent 1: Item 3 (52), Item 4 (45)
  - Agent 2: Item 3 (47), Item 4 (15)

4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest available value).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 for balance (highest remaining valuation).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and total valuation is reasonably balanced.
