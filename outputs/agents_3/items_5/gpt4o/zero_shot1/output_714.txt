Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  35  14  87  88
1  79  21  40  18   1
2  84  37  36  88  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is as happy as possible with their allocation, considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items need to be allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [33, 35, 14, 87, 88]
- Agent 1's valuations: [79, 21, 40, 18, 1]
- Agent 2's valuations: [84, 37, 36, 88, 59]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most. However, we must ensure that each agent gets at least one item, given that there are 5 items and 3 agents.

Let's consider the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (84)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (35)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (40)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (87)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (88)

To ensure fairness, we can allocate accordingly, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This way, every agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are reasonably based on valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
