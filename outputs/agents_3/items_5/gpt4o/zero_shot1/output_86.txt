Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  39  58  98   0
1  82  77  96  26   3
2  28   2  96   1  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total utility while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's assign the items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair chance:

1. **Item 3** - Agent 0 values this item the most at 98.
2. **Item 2** - Agent 1 values this item the most at 96.
3. **Item 0** - Agent 1 values this item the most at 82.
4. **Item 4** - Agent 2 values this item the most at 67.
5. **Item 1** - Agent 0 values this item the most at 39.

We ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation balances the overall utility and ensures every agent receives at least one item.
