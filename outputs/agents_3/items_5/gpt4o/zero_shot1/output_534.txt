Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  47  62  32  38
1  77  52   3  54  78
2  81  98  30  73  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 52  3 54 78]
 [81 98 30 73 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. An effective way to do this is to assign items based on their highest valuation by any agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 89     | 47     | 62     | 32     | 38     |
| 1     | 77     | 52     | 3      | 54     | 78     |
| 2     | 81     | 98     | 30     | 73     | 27     |

1. **Item 0:** Highest value is 89 (Agent 0)
2. **Item 1:** Highest value is 98 (Agent 2)
3. **Item 2:** Highest value is 62 (Agent 0)
4. **Item 3:** Highest value is 73 (Agent 2)
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is 78 (Agent 1)

Now, let's allocate based on these values:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 4.
- Agent 2 gets Item 1 and Item 3.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, and every agent receives at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
