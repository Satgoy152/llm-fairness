Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80   4  19  62  25
1  21  73  54  33   1
2  59  22  21  94  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the most at 94.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it highly at 73.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0, who values it the most at 80.
4. Assign item 4 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it at 69, which is the highest for this item.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1, who values it at 54, which is higher than the others.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This distribution maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
