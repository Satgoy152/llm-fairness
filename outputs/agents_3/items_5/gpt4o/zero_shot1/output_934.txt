Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  22  60  38  18
1  65  98  61  47  47
2  43  79  34  32   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 98 61 47 47]
 [43 79 34 32  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [40, 22, 60, 38, 18]
Agent 1: [65, 98, 61, 47, 47]
Agent 2: [43, 79, 34, 32, 8]
```

We can proceed by analyzing the highest value each agent places on the items and try to allocate items in such a way that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 98.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest at 60.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest at 65 after item 1.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 0 and Agent 1 already have items, and Agent 2 values it the highest among the remaining.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 2.

The allocation then becomes:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 0
- Agent 2: Item 3

Therefore, the JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
