Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  98  76  75   3
1  25  85  56  52  88
2   5  74  15  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 98)
   - Second highest value item: Item 2 (value 76)
   - Allocated items: [1, 2]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 88)
   - Allocated items: [4]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 65)
   - Second highest value item: Item 0 (value 5)
   - Allocated items: [3, 0]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the total value based on each agent's preferences. The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
