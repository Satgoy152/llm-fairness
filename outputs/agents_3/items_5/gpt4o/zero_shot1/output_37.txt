Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  43  47  60  24
1   3  20  10   9   2
2  62  90   9  77   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 20 10  9  2]
 [62 90  9 77  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent places on the available items, while also ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the valuation table and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [62, 43, 47, 60, 24]
   - Highest value: 62 for item 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [3, 20, 10, 9, 2]
   - Highest value: 20 for item 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [62, 90, 9, 77, 2]
   - Highest value: 90 for item 1, but it's already taken by agent 1, so next highest is 77 for item 3

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, and 3. We still have items 2 and 4 to allocate.

4. **Remaining items: 2 and 4**:
   - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (47), and item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0 (24), but Agent 2 values item 4 at 2, while Agent 1 needs more items.

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and considering remaining options:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (needs more items, even though low value)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly considering the agents' valuations.
