Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  95  20  80  68
1  66  86  11  83  83
2  96  22  39  58  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 86 11 83 83]
 [96 22 39 58 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We have to ensure that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [71, 95, 20, 80, 68]
- Agent 1: [66, 86, 11, 83, 83]
- Agent 2: [96, 22, 39, 58, 50]

To maximize fairness, we can attempt to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (96), so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (95), so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (83), so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
4. For item 3, the highest valuation is by **Agent 0** (80), so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. For item 2, only Agent 2 has not received a second item, and their valuation (39) is higher than Agent 1's (11), so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
