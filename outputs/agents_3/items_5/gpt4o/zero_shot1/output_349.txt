Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  69  60  62  44
1  41  93   5  47  28
2  42  82  98  65  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents based on the given valuations, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: Look at each column to see which agent values the item the most.
   
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91 (highest).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 93 (highest).
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 98 (highest).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 65 (highest).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44 (highest among available choices).

2. **Allocate items based on highest value**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated and all agents receive at least one item**:
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives Items 2 and 3.

The allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most, and all items are fairly distributed.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
