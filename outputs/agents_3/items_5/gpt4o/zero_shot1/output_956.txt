Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  38  55  35  71
1  40  92   9  48  63
2  57  60  89  28  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Sort the items based on their value for each agent.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Ensure all 5 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (71), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (92), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (89), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has one item, and two items remain to be allocated.

- The remaining items are 0 and 3:
  - For item 0:
    - Agent 0 values it at 12
    - Agent 1 values it at 40
    - Agent 2 values it at 57
  - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (57), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.

- For item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 35
  - Agent 1 values it at 48
  - Agent 2 values it at 28
  - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (48), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total value for each is maximized based on their preferences.
