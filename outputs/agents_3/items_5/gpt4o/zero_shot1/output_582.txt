Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  45  14  38  42
1  75   4  10  51  92
2   7  51  97  67   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We'll aim to allocate items so that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (98), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (92), so we assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (97), so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 1 second after item 0 (45), so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 3 next to item 4 (51), so we assign item 3 to agent 1.

Now, all items are allocated, and here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
