Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  18  79  67  30
1  95  41  94  36  10
2  44  24   5  85  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (value 79) and item 0 (value 77), and these are the highest values among all agents for these items.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 41) and item 3 (value 36).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1. 
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The remaining item is item 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, which has the highest valuation (65) compared to other agents for this item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are allocated, and each agent gets a set of items that fairly reflects their valuations.
