Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  21  64  43  28
1  37  72  34   1  90
2   6  13  40  65  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item. A common approach is to aim for a distribution where each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible or where each agent is satisfied with the items they receive based on their preferences.

Given the valuations table:

```
         0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0: 5  21  64  43  28
Agent 1: 37 72  34  1  90
Agent 2: 6  13  40  65 74
```

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is balanced.

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 and 4. Allocating these items might give Agent 1 the highest satisfaction.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 3. Allocating this item to Agent 2 might ensure fairness.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 2. Allocating this item to Agent 0 might balance the distribution further.

Considering these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives item 2.
- **Agent 1** receives items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 2** receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation distributes all items and attempts to satisfy the agents based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of 5 items distributed.
