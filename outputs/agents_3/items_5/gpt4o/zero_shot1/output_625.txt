Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  54  95  22   8
1  41  80  45  88  57
2  98  20  85  99  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and valuations. Given that there are 3 agents and 5 items, one agent will get 2 items while the other two agents each get 1 item.

One approach is to assign the items based on the highest valuations and ensuring fairness. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 95. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 99. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 80. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 0**: Now, Agent 2 has a high valuation of item 0 at 98. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Finally, Agent 1 can take item 4, as they have a valuation of 57 for it.

Now, let's ensure this allocation covers all 5 items and is as fair as possible:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent is fairly considered based on their valuations. Let's put this into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
