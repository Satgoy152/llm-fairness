Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  24  20  13  97
1  70  64  11  15  86
2  42  62  34  32  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One standard approach is to use a method like the Hungarian algorithm, which is commonly used for solving assignment problems. However, for simplicity, we can try a heuristic approach that aims to distribute items based on the highest valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process that aims to balance the distribution of items based on their valuations:

1. **Assign item 4 to agent 0**: This is because agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 97.

2. **Assign item 0 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 70, which is their highest valuation for an unassigned item.

3. **Assign item 1 to agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 at 62, which is their highest valuation for an unassigned item.

4. **Assign item 3 to agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 at 13, which is their next best unassigned item.

5. **Assign item 2 to agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 11, which is their next best unassigned item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value available, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
