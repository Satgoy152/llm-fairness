Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  92  63  11  45
1  78  28  98  75  84
2  60  57  44  55  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple strategy that aims to maximize each agent's utility by giving them the items they value most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (92), followed by item 2 (63), and then item 0 (61).

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (98), followed by item 4 (84), and then item 0 (78).

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (86), followed by item 0 (60), and item 3 (55).

Now, we will allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1, as it provides the highest value of 98.
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0, as it provides them their highest value of 92.
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2, as it provides them their highest value of 86.
- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1, as it provides them their next highest value of 78. (Agent 1 cannot get any more items as they already have two)
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 0, as they value it more than Agent 2 (11 vs. 55), but it balances the allocation count.

After this allocation, each agent has received the maximum value possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```
