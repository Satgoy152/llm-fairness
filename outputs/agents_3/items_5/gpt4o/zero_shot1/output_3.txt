Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  63  12   4  20
1  14  97  34  26  83
2  98  12  86  87  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets a similar number of items. Since there are 5 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive an additional item. Let's try to allocate them based on a balanced approach where each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution maximizes the sum of values for the agents.

Initial valuations:
- Agent 0: 10, 63, 12, 4, 20
- Agent 1: 14, 97, 34, 26, 83
- Agent 2: 98, 12, 86, 87, 52

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's benefit while trying to balance the number of items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (63)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (97) is already taken.
   - Next highest: Item 4 (83)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (98)

Now, each agent has one item. We need to allocate the remaining two items (2 and 3):

4. Remaining items: 2 and 3
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (87), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as it has the highest remaining value for it among the agents (12).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
