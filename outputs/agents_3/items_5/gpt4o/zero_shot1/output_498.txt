Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  77  32  28  94
1  75  57  90  60  90
2  35  29  95  90   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuation each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (94), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (90), so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (90), so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. For the remaining items 0 and 1, we consider the highest available valuations:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 75, which is the highest valuation for item 0 among all agents, so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 77, which is higher than agent 1's valuation of 57 and agent 2's valuation of 29, so we assign item 1 to agent 0.

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
