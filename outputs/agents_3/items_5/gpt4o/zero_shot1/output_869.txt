Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  49  32   0  20
1  44  16  32   5  54
2  70  83  24  25  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to optimize the allocation such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 0
  - Item 4: 20

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 5
  - Item 4: 54

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 49

One possible fair allocation is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 81 by Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 83 by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 32, which is equal for Agent 0 and Agent 1. We'll give it to Agent 0 since Agent 1 can benefit more from another item.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 25 by Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 54 by Agent 1.

Allocating the items based on the above valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
