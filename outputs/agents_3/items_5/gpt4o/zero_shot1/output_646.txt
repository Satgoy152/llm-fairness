Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  25  94  82  85
1   2  89  30  84  97
2  23  42  19  62  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent. One approach is to use a greedy method, selecting items for each agent that provide the highest value until all items are allocated.

Here are the steps for the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 95)
   - Next highest value item: Item 2 (value 94)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 97)
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (value 84)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest remaining value item: Item 1 (value 42)

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 gets items [4, 3]
- Agent 2 gets item [1]

This allocation distributes all 5 items based on maximizing the individual agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
