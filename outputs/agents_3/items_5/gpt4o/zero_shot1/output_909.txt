Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  39  61  67  77
1  18  87  82  88  69
2  67  14  92  85  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations, let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated without exceeding the total of 5 items.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 4 has the highest value (77), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
  - Next highest is item 3 (67), but let's check other agents first.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 3 has the highest value (88), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
  - Next highest is item 1 (87), but let's check other agents first.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 2 has the highest value (92), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
  - Next highest is item 3, but it's already assigned.

Now each agent has one item. There are 2 items left to allocate (items 0 and 1).

- Re-evaluate for remaining items:
  - **Item 0** is valued highest by agent 2 (67), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
  - **Item 1** is valued highest by agent 1 (87), so assign item 1 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are distributed according to the given valuations.
