Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  22   3  20  85
1  88  99  22  22  77
2  27   0  18  58  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets as much value as possible, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [78, 22, 3, 20, 85]
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (85)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [88, 99, 22, 22, 77]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (99)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [27, 0, 18, 58, 34]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (58)

After assigning the highest value items, we have:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3

Next, we allocate the remaining items (0 and 2) to maximize the overall value:

4. **Remaining Items:** Item 0 and Item 2

- Item 0: Highest remaining value is with Agent 1 (88)
- Item 2: Highest remaining value is with Agent 1 (22)

Thus, we allocate:
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

Now let's compile the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on the agent valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
