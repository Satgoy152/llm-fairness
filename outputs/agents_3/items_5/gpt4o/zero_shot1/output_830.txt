Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36   8  84  72  25
1  27  99  63  11  96
2  50  60  14  99  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents. This will help in making decisions that maximize satisfaction.

2. **Allocate Items:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If one agent ends up with too many items or too much total value compared to others, consider reallocating some items to balance the distribution.

Let's go through this step-by-step for the given table:

- **Item 0:**  
  - Agent 0 values it at 36
  - Agent 1 values it at 27
  - Agent 2 values it at 50
  - Best allocation: Agent 2

- **Item 1:**  
  - Agent 0 values it at 8
  - Agent 1 values it at 99
  - Agent 2 values it at 60
  - Best allocation: Agent 1

- **Item 2:**  
  - Agent 0 values it at 84
  - Agent 1 values it at 63
  - Agent 2 values it at 14
  - Best allocation: Agent 0

- **Item 3:**  
  - Agent 0 values it at 72
  - Agent 1 values it at 11
  - Agent 2 values it at 99
  - Best allocation: Agent 2

- **Item 4:**  
  - Agent 0 values it at 25
  - Agent 1 values it at 96
  - Agent 2 values it at 78
  - Best allocation: Agent 1

Now, let's write the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest preferences, and all items are fairly distributed.
