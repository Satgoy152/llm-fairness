Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  39  86  57  20
1  15  86  40  26   1
2  36  79  23  33  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the agents receive an equitable share, maximizing their satisfaction with the items they receive. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value of 86). After reviewing the remaining items, the next highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value of 57).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value of 86).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most, but since Agent 1 has already taken it, the next best option is item 0 (value of 36).

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- **Item 4** can go to Agent 2, who values it at 32, which is higher than the valuations by Agent 0 (20) and Agent 1 (1).
- This leaves **Item 0** to be allocated to Agent 0, as Agent 1 already has an item and Agent 2 has item 4.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an equitable share according to their valuations while distributing all 5 items.
