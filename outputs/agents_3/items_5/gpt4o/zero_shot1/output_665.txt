Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  64  83  78  12
1  55  13  15  37  50
2  59  43  45  96  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 13 15 37 50]
 [59 43 45 96 70]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will consider the valuations matrix and try to distribute the items based on maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [21, 64, 83, 78, 12]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [55, 13, 15, 37, 50]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [59, 43, 45, 96, 70]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (55).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (64).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (83).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (96).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (70).

Thus, the initial allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
