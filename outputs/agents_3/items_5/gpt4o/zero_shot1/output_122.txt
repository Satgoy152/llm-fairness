Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  97  89  66  97
1  89  88  99  10  59
2  17  87  79  26  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the overall distribution of items is as equitable as possible according to the valuations provided. We'll attempt to distribute items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [14, 97, 89, 66, 97]
- Agent 1: [89, 88, 99, 10, 59]
- Agent 2: [17, 87, 79, 26, 36]

We can start by assigning the items with the highest valuations to the respective agents:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 88, Agent 2 values it at 87. Agent 0 should get this item because it has the highest value for it.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is higher than the other agents' valuations. So, Agent 1 should receive this item.
3. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 59, Agent 2 values it at 36. Agent 0 should get this item because it has the highest value for it.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 89, which is higher than Agent 0's 14 and Agent 2's 17. Thus, Agent 1 should receive this item.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 10, Agent 2 values it at 26. Agent 0 should get this item because it has the highest value for it.

Based on this analysis, here's a fair allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on maximizing valuations for each item.
