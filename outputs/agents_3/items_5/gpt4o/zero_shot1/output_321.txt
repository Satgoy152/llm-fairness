Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  65  27  29   9
1  13  68  14  45  14
2  19  98  78  68  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider giving each agent at least one item and try to maximize their total valuation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (65)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (63)
   - Allocation: Let's first allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (68) - already allocated
   - Second highest: Item 3 (45)
   - Allocation: Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (98) - already allocated
   - Second highest: Item 4 (96)
   - Allocation: Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, the distribution is:
- Agent 0 has Item 1
- Agent 1 has Item 3
- Agent 2 has Item 4

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 2).

4. **Allocate Item 0**:
   - Highest remaining valuation for Item 0: Agent 0 (63)
   - Allocation: Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

5. **Allocate Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation for Item 2: Agent 2 (78)
   - Allocation: Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
