Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  56  60  42   7
1   7   8  92  28  53
2  67  27   5  63  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7  8 92 28 53]
 [67 27  5 63 25]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [83, 56, 60, 42, 7]
- Agent 1: [7, 8, 92, 28, 53]
- Agent 2: [67, 27, 5, 63, 25]

A fair allocation could be to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 2, but it is already allocated to Agent 1. The next highest available item is item 1.
- Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 4.
- Agent 2 already has item 3, and the next highest valuation for an unallocated item is item 0, which is already taken. Therefore, Agent 2 will not get any more items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
