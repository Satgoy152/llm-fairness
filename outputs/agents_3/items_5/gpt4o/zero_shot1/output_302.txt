Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  37  51  29  59
1  75  52  26  47  70
2  44  11  29  62  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (value 59), 2 (value 51), 0 (value 45)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (value 75), 4 (value 70), 1 (value 52)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (value 62), 4 (value 54), 0 (value 44)

Considering these preferences, we can make the following allocations to fairly distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (value 51) and item 1 (value 37)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (value 75)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (value 62) and item 4 (value 54)

This allocation gives each agent a chance to receive items they value, and all items are distributed.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
