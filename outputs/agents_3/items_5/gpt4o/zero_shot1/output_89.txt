Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  44   8  98  62
1  96  63  27  64   4
2  69  73  21  66  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 63 27 64  4]
 [69 73 21 66 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. We have three agents and five items to allocate, so ideally, each agent should receive about 1 or 2 items.

Based on the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  44   8  98  62
1  96  63  27  64   4
2  69  73  21  66  59
```

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (98) - highest value for agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 (96) - highest value for agent 1.
   - Item 1 (63) - second highest value for agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (59) - highest value for agent 2.
   - Item 2 (21) - next available item for agent 2.

Allocations ensure all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
