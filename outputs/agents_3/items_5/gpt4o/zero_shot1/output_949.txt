Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  36  91  67  62
1  99  43  88  66  32
2  43  79  53  62  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as high as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (91), 3 (67), 4 (62)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (99), 2 (88)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining highest value item: 1 (79)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while attempting to maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
