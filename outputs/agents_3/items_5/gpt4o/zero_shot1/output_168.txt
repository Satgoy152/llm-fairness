Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  18  11  34  31
1  66  32  43  78  73
2  34  91  55  23  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [66 32 43 78 73]
 [34 91 55 23 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is a strategy to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items as [79, 18, 11, 34, 31]
2. **Agent 1**: Values items as [66, 32, 43, 78, 73]
3. **Agent 2**: Values items as [34, 91, 55, 23, 30]

Let's assign the items based on the highest relative value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 79.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 with a value of 78.
- **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 91.

Now, we will assign the remaining items:

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 with a value of 73 (second highest for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 with a value of 55 (second highest for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed considering the highest preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution considering the agents' preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
