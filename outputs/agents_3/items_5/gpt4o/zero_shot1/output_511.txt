Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4   8  71  88  35
1  60  25   6  89  97
2  88  23   6  85  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (88), Item 2 (71), Item 1 (8), Item 4 (35), Item 0 (4)

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 3 (89), Item 0 (60), Item 1 (25), Item 2 (6)

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (88), Item 3 (85), Item 4 (63), Item 1 (23), Item 2 (6)

Next, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent's valuation is maximized without repeating items:

- **Assigning based on highest preference:**
  - Agent 0 receives Item 3 (88)
  - Agent 1 receives Item 4 (97)
  - Agent 2 receives Item 0 (88)

- **Remaining items: 1, 2**

- **Continue allocation:**
  - Agent 0's next highest preference is Item 2 (71)
  - Agent 1's next highest preference is Item 3, but it's taken; next available is Item 1 (25)
  - Agent 2's next highest preference is Item 3, but it's taken; next available is Item 1, but it's taken; so Item 2 is assigned to Agent 0

- **Final Allocation:**
  - Agent 0 receives Items 3, 2
  - Agent 1 receives Items 4, 1
  - Agent 2 receives Item 0

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
