Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  73  80  93   8
1  38  73  35  43  67
2  62  25  34  79  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation of items for all agents. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Has the highest value for item 3 (93).
   - Also has the highest value for item 2 (80).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has the highest value for item 4 (67).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has the highest value for item 0 (62).
   - Also has the highest value for item 1 (73).

Based on these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 1

This allocation ensures a balanced distribution while considering the highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
