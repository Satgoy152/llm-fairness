Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  27  73  87   4
1  19  13  65  89  76
2  89  74  40  48  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while trying to maximize the total value, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuations and aims to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [Item 0: 78, Item 1: 27, Item 2: 73, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 4]
   - Agent 1: [Item 0: 19, Item 1: 13, Item 2: 65, Item 3: 89, Item 4: 76]
   - Agent 2: [Item 0: 89, Item 1: 74, Item 2: 40, Item 3: 48, Item 4: 82]

2. **Determine the best valued item for each agent and allocate it if possible:**

   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (87).
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest (89), but since Agent 0 also values it highly, we will allocate it to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest valued item is Item 4 (76).
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 the highest (89).

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance the distribution:**

   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   
4. **Allocate the remaining items by considering the leftover highest values:**

   - The remaining items are Item 1 and Item 2.
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 at 74, the highest remaining value for Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 73, the next highest value.

5. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Item 3, Item 2
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Item 0, Item 1

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
