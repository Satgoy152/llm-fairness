Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  64   4  27  22
1  62  68  30  77  37
2  83   9  48  73  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [83  9 48 73 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [72, 64, 4, 27, 22]
- Agent 1: [62, 68, 30, 77, 37]
- Agent 2: [83, 9, 48, 73, 97]

We should aim to allocate items such that we maximize the total value each agent perceives from their items. One way to do this is by assigning items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 83 for Agent 2)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 64 for Agent 0)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 30 for Agent 1)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 77 for Agent 1)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 97 for Agent 2)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item [1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4]

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
