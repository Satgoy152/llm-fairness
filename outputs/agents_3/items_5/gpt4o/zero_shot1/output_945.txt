Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  43  16  63  29
1  85  48  61  33  67
2  15  52  97  82  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. A fair allocation can be achieved by assigning the items based on the agents' valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (66), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, but since it's already taken, we assign the next highest value item, which is item 4 (67).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (97), so we assign item 2 to agent 2.

Now, we have items 1 and 3 left to allocate.

4. Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 3 (63), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 has the next highest value for item 1 (48), so we assign item 1 to agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on maximizing their total value received, and all 5 items are allocated.
