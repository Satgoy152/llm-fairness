Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  15  80  76  92
1  61  18  46  95   5
2  18  63  67  79   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 18 46 95  5]
 [18 63 67 79  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations provided in the table. A common approach is to maximize individual satisfaction or total valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no items are left unallocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [60, 15, 80, 76, 92]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [61, 18, 46, 95, 5]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [18, 63, 67, 79, 8]

We aim to allocate the items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 60
   - Agent 1: 61
   - Agent 2: 18
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 61)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 15
   - Agent 1: 18
   - Agent 2: 63
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (value: 63)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 80
   - Agent 1: 46
   - Agent 2: 67
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 80)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 76
   - Agent 1: 95
   - Agent 2: 79
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 95)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 92
   - Agent 1: 5
   - Agent 2: 8
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 92)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3
- Agent 2 receives items: 1

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
