Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  41  95   1  57
1  99  75  28  56  67
2  89  61  85  65  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [89 61 85 65 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total happiness of all agents, such as a greedy allocation based on each agent's highest valuation per item. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (89), but item 0 is already taken by agent 1. Next highest for agent 2 is item 4 (87).

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**: After item 2, next highest is item 4 (57), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (41).
5. **Agent 1**: After item 0, next highest is item 4 (67), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (75), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (56).
6. **Agent 2**: After item 4, next highest is item 2 (85), but it's taken. Next is item 3 (65), but it's taken.

Based on this, a fair allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 0
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 3

Now let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
