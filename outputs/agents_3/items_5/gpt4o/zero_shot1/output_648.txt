Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  84  81  85  23
1  45  64  22  16  96
2   4  17  26  23  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences. Here's a suggested allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (88), 1 (84), 2 (81), and 3 (85). These are the highest compared to other agents for those respective items.
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (96).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has moderate valuations, but the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (26).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, only item 1 remains unallocated. Between the agents, Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (84), so we allocate it to Agent 0.

Here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences while ensuring all five items are distributed.
