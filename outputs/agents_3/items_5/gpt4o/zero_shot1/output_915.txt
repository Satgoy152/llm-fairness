Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60   1  16  45  35
1  13  50  57  23  85
2  51  18  43  65  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [51 18 43 65 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets based on their preferences, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (60), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most (85), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most (96), but since item 4 is already allocated, we allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (65).
4. Now, we allocate the remaining items: 
   - Item 2 is valued the next highest by Agent 1 (57), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: To ensure each agent gets at least one item, we consider Agent 2 next, who values item 1 (18) more than Agent 0 (1), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
