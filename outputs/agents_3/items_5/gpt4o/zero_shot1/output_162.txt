Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  28  70  68  50
1   6  19  26  53  80
2  36  39  12  53  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and attempt to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent first:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (70).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (80).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (89), but since item 4 is already assigned to Agent 1, the next highest is item 1 (39).

2. Since item 4 is already taken, Agent 2 can have item 1 or another item that gives the next best valuation without conflict.

3. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall utility or fairness. Let's do this step-by-step:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Now, assign the remaining items (0, 3):

- Agent 0: Item 3 (68) has a high valuation for Agent 0, so it's a good assignment to maximize Agent 0's satisfaction.
- Agent 2: Assign item 0 to Agent 2 as it has a decent valuation and has no conflict.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items such that agents are getting some of their higher-valued items, maximizing the overall satisfaction without any conflicts.
