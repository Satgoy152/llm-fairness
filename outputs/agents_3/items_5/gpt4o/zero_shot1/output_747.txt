Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  28  61  54  50
1  23  50  37  67  60
2  20  52  47  29  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for a distribution where each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations. We will consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items to distribute them fairly.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (68), Item 2 (61)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (67), Item 4 (60)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest remaining valuation: Item 1 (52)

Based on these considerations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3 and Item 4.
- Agent 2 gets Item 1.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their high valuations, and all items are distributed.
