Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  95  71  17  41
1  24  26  82   1  15
2  34  48  68   4  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Let's look for a way to distribute the items so that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's a breakdown of the agent's valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [23, 95, 71, 17, 41]
- Agent 1: [24, 26, 82, 1, 15]
- Agent 2: [34, 48, 68, 4, 63]

To allocate the items fairly, we'll try to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 (95) is the highest value for any agent for any item. Let's assign this to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (82) is the highest value for Agent 1. Let's assign this to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (63) is a high value for Agent 2. Let's assign this to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, and 4. We need to allocate items 0 and 3.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (34) compared to Agent 0 (23) and Agent 1 (24). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (17) compared to Agent 1 (1) and Agent 2 (4). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
