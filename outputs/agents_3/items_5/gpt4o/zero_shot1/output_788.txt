Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  91  51  11  81
1  84  42  44  22  76
2  26  16  10  90  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 42 44 22 76]
 [26 16 10 90 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to give each agent a number of items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. This means we will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [49, 91, 51, 11, 81]
- Agent 1: [84, 42, 44, 22, 76]
- Agent 2: [26, 16, 10, 90, 13]

We can use the following approach to allocate items:

1. Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item that is not yet allocated.
2. Proceed to the next highest-valued item for each agent until all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 91).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 84).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 90).
- For the remaining items, give:
  - Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 81).
  - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 44).

This allocation ensures each agent gets one of their highest-valued items and distributes the remaining items to maximize fairness. Now, we can present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
