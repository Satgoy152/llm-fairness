Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  13  58  36  29
1  73  91  81  11   8
2  78  65  51  21  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [78 65 51 21 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Let's look at the highest valuations for each item and allocate accordingly:

- For item 0, agent 2 has the highest valuation with 78.
- For item 1, agent 1 has the highest valuation with 91.
- For item 2, agent 1 has the highest valuation with 81.
- For item 3, agent 0 has the highest valuation with 36.
- For item 4, agent 2 has the highest valuation with 77.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
