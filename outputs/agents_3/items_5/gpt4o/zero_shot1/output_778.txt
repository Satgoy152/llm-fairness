Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  54  74  70  18
1  13  16  85  15  56
2  30  79  69  59   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 0 (80), Item 2 (74), and Item 3 (70).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 2 (85), Item 4 (56), and Item 1 (16).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 1 (79), Item 2 (69), and Item 3 (59).

Considering these preferences, we can assign:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 0 and Item 3, which are high-value items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 2, which is the highest value item for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 1, which is the highest value item for Agent 2.
- Finally, assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest value item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is reasonably balanced among the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
