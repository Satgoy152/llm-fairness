Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  60  57  45  6  17
1  10  47  92  4  43
2  28  24  95  8  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Among the items, Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (60).
   - Thus, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (92).
   - Thus, allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (69) and item 2 (95), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1.
   - Thus, allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 3). To do this, we can look at the next highest valuations:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 1 (57).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**:
   - The remaining item is 3, and Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 3 (4) compared to Agent 0 (6) and Agent 2 (8).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 compared to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
