Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  37  68  48  76
1  46  32   4  38  93
2  17  44  23   8  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [17 44 23  8 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value: Item 0 with a valuation of 90.
   - Second highest value: Item 4 with a valuation of 76.
   - Choose items 0 and 4 for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value (excluding already allocated items): Item 4 with a valuation of 93, but it is already taken.
   - Second highest value: Item 0 with a valuation of 46, but it is already taken.
   - Next highest available item: Item 3 with a valuation of 38.
   - Choose item 3 for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value (excluding already allocated items): Item 1 with a valuation of 44.
   - Choose item 1 for Agent 2.

4. **Allocating the remaining item (Item 2):**
   - Agent 0 has items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 has item 3.
   - Agent 2 has item 1.

   Since Agent 1 currently has the least number of items, allocate the remaining item (Item 2) to Agent 1.

The allocations are now complete with each agent having at least one item and all items being allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
