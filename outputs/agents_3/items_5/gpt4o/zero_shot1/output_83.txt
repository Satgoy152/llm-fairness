Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  57  31  29  56
1  51  15  87  32  80
2  57  18  26  27  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent. One way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 51
   - Agent 2 values it at 57

   Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 18

   Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 31
   - Agent 1 values it at 87
   - Agent 2 values it at 26

   Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 2 values it at 27

   Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 56
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 51

   Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, and every agent receives an integer number of items.
