Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  45  90  36  16
1  29  47  25  54  13
2  37  53  54   9  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility or the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations for each item. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 56.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest at 53.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest at 90.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it highest at 54.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 16.

2. **Allocate the items based on the highest valuations**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Check and adjust for fairness**:
   - Agent 0 has 3 items (0, 2, 4).
   - Agent 1 has 1 item (3).
   - Agent 2 has 1 item (1).

Given that each agent must receive at least one item, this distribution ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
