Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  57  31  72  48
1   7  98  24  60  64
2  12  75  33  84  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should consider the preferences of each agent and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. We can use a method that tries to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 3 but since it is already taken by agent 0, we can allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Based on this, we can assign the items as follows:
- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 0, where they have the highest value.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4, where they have high values.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

This allocation ensures every agent gets at least one item and maximizes their satisfaction according to their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
