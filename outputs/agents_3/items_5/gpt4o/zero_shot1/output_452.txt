Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  61  17   4  15
1  90  58  84  80  72
2  73  23  66  36  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [73 23 66 36 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the table and assign the items accordingly:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 76  
- Item 1: 61  
- Item 2: 17  
- Item 3: 4  
- Item 4: 15  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 90  
- Item 1: 58  
- Item 2: 84  
- Item 3: 80  
- Item 4: 72  

Agent 2's valuations:  
- Item 0: 73  
- Item 1: 23  
- Item 2: 66  
- Item 3: 36  
- Item 4: 61  

For a fair allocation, let's consider assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is only assigned to one agent.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the highest (90).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest (61).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest (84).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest (80).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (72).

Given these observations, we can assign the items such that Agent 1 gets the majority of the items they value highly, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

This allocation ensures that the total value received is maximized and distributed fairly, with each agent getting at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
