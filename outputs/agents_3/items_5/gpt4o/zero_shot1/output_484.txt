Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  36  87  65  71
1  94  82  85  75  92
2  19   3  74  13  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. This can be done by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. 

Given the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 22 | 36 | 87 | 65 | 71 |
| 1          | 94 | 82 | 85 | 75 | 92 |
| 2          | 19 | 3  | 74 | 13 | 18 |

Let's allocate items to agents based on these valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 94 (Agent 1)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 82 (Agent 1)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 87 (Agent 0)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 75 (Agent 1)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 92 (Agent 1)

From this initial allocation, Agent 1 would get all items. To ensure fairness, we'll adjust the allocation so that each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 2 (to ensure Agent 2 gets at least one item)

Now, distribute the remaining items to maximize total valuation while ensuring fairness:

- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1
- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 1
- Assign **Item 4** to Agent 1

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
