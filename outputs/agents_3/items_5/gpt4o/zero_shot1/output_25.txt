Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  53   9  57  23
1  58   0  36  56  85
2  40  22  53  61  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items such that their total valuation is maximized while also considering fairness among the agents. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's look at the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values: [54, 53, 9, 57, 23]
- Agent 1 values: [58, 0, 36, 56, 85]
- Agent 2 values: [40, 22, 53, 61, 64]

We will start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (57).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 (85).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (61), but since item 3 is already taken by agent 0, we move to their next highest, which is item 4 (64), but it's taken by agent 1. Next, item 2 (53) is available.

Now we check if more items can be allocated fairly:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (54) is the next highest for agent 0.
- Agent 1: Item 3 (56) is the next best option, but it's taken, so we allocate item 2 (36), but it's taken, so no further allocation is possible for agent 1.
- Agent 2: Item 3 (61) is the next highest, but it's taken, so no further allocation is possible for agent 2.

Revisiting allocations to adjust:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 4.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 2.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize their individual valuations while ensuring fairness.
