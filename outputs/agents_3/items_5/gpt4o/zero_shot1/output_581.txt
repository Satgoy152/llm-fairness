Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  86  78  84   4
1  35  67   9  38  20
2  95  58  30  89  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation is balanced among the agents as evenly as possible. Let's analyze the valuation table and make a tentative allocation:

Valuation Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  86  78  84   4
1  35  67   9  38  20
2  95  58  30  89  27
```

One way to allocate these items is to focus on maximizing each agent's happiness while ensuring a fair distribution of items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (86), Item 3 (84)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (67), Item 0 (35)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (95), Item 3 (89)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now we need to allocate two more items while considering the remaining high-value items for each agent:

4. **Agent 0** already has Item 1.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest value for them (78).

5. **Agent 1** has Item 0.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, as it is the next best option remaining for them (20).

Finally, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest value items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is five.
