Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16   8  39  46  27
1  37  37  75  27  95
2  84  24  81  52  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 46.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 95.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 84.

Let's continue allocating remaining items:

4. **Remaining items:**
   - Item 1 and Item 2 need to be allocated.
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2 (81), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 has a higher valuation for item 1 (8) compared to Agent 1 (37), but if we consider maximizing total valuations, Agent 1 should receive item 1 since Agent 1 already has a lower total value after initial allocation.

Ultimately, the allocation can be as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 1]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2]

Thus, the items are allocated as:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
