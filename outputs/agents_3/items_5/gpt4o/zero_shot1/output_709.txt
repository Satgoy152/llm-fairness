Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  69  86  14  49
1  71  68  28  27  19
2  65  18  59  70   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can follow a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (86) and item 1 (69). 
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (70).
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (71).
4. Agent 0 can take item 4 (49) as it has the second-highest valuation after agent 1.

With this strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, while also fairly distributing the items among the agents.
