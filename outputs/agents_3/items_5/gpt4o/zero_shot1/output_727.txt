Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22   9  58  14   0
1  57  33  29  51  20
2  73  55  40  21  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 55 40 21 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives or ensure a balanced distribution of total value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 9, 58, 14, 0]
- Agent 1: [57, 33, 29, 51, 20]
- Agent 2: [73, 55, 40, 21, 66]

One approach to ensuring a fair allocation is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, and then adjust to ensure each agent gets approximately the same total valuation.

1. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2 (73).
2. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 2 (55).
3. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 0 (58).
4. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1 (51).
5. Item 4 is most valued by Agent 2 (66).

A first fair allocation attempt might be:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 4.

This results in:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 58
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 51
- Total valuation for Agent 2: 73 + 55 + 66 = 194

This distribution heavily favors Agent 2. Let's reassign to balance:

Reassign item 1 to Agent 1 for a better balance:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.

Recalculate valuations:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 58
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 33 + 51 = 84
- Total valuation for Agent 2: 73 + 66 = 139

This distribution is more balanced.

Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
