Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  79  82   5  52
1  32  71  49  72  30
2  74  22  83  71  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 22 83 71 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

### Valuations Table
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  79  82   5  52
1  32  71  49  72  30
2  74  22  83  71  43
```

### Steps to Allocate
1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (72).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (83), but since item 2 is already taken by Agent 0, we check the next highest, which is item 0 (74).

Now, let's proceed to allocate the remaining items:

4. **Remaining Items**: Items 1 and 4 are left.
5. **Allocate Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 79.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 71.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 22.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it.

6. **Allocate Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 52.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 30.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 43.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it.

### Allocations
The allocation strategy gives us the following:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the items are allocated based on maximizing their valuations.
