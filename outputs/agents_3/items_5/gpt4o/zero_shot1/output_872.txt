Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  42   2  29  93
1  96  27  10  37  46
2  92  37  50  31  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 5. One common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4 (93). We can assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96). We can assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (50). We can assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. For the remaining items (1 and 3), we should assign them to maximize the total value across all agents.

   - Item 1: Agent 2 has the second-highest valuation (37) compared to Agent 0 (42) and Agent 1 (27). To balance allocations, we can assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has only one item so far.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (29) compared to Agent 1 (37) and Agent 2 (31). Since Agent 1 already has one item, we assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocations can be summarized as:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 5.
