Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18   0  32  25   6
1  89  33  58  67  83
2  79  66  99  85  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the values and make allocations:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 0: 18
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 32
- Item 3: 25
- Item 4: 6

**Agent 1:**
- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 33
- Item 2: 58
- Item 3: 67
- Item 4: 83

**Agent 2:**
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 66
- Item 2: 99
- Item 3: 85
- Item 4: 73

To maximize the total valuation, let's allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, while ensuring fairness by distributing items across agents:

1. **Assign item 2 to Agent 2** (highest valuation of 99).
2. **Assign item 0 to Agent 1** (highest remaining valuation of 89).
3. **Assign item 3 to Agent 2** (next highest valuation of 85).
4. **Assign item 4 to Agent 1** (next highest valuation of 83).
5. **Assign item 1 to Agent 2** (remaining item with highest agent valuation of 66).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent, and the distribution maximizes the total valuation while ensuring fairness in item distribution.
