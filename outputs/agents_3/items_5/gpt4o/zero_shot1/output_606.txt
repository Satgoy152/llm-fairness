Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  19  88  34   9
1  34   4  29  80  18
2  57  57  75  99  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [57 57 75 99 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 9

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 80
  - Item 4: 18

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 46

A good allocation strategy is to assign each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that each item is only assigned once.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0's highest value is for Item 2 (value 88).
2. Agent 1's highest value is for Item 3 (value 80).
3. Agent 2's highest value is for Item 3 (value 99), but since it's assigned to Agent 1, we choose the next highest, which is Item 0 (value 57).

Remaining items are 1 and 4. Let's allocate them:

- Agent 0 can take Item 1 (value 19).
- Agent 2 can take Item 4 (value 46).

The allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
