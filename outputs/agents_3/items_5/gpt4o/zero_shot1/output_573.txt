Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  34  98  88  21
1  59  97  28  26  56
2  59  95  81   2  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated. We will aim to maximize the total value for each agent and ensure that the allocation seems fair.

First, let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [10, 34, 98, 88, 21]
- Agent 1: [59, 97, 28, 26, 56]
- Agent 2: [59, 95, 81, 2, 95]

A potential fair allocation could involve each agent getting at least one item, and the allocation might look like this:

1. **Agent 0**: The most valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 98), but since fairness requires distribution, we should consider other high-value items that other agents value less.
2. **Agent 1**: The most valued item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 97).
3. **Agent 2**: The most valued items for Agent 2 are items 1 and 4 (both valued 95).

Let's try an allocation that balances these considerations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 98) - This is the highest value for Agent 0, and it's less of a priority for others.
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 97) - This is the highest value for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 4 (values 59 and 95) - These are among the top values for Agent 2. Item 0 has a high value for Agent 2 and relatively lower for Agent 1.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 26) - This is a lower priority item for Agent 1, but it allows a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all 5 items are distributed, and there is a reasonable consideration of each agent's preferences.
