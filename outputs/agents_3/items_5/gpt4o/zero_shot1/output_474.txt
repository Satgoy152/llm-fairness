Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  58  91  47  84
1  87  93  42  58   5
2  50   3  31  17  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [50  3 31 17 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, assigning items based on the highest valuation relative to each agent's preferences until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (91).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (93).
3. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 4 (84).
4. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 0 (87).
5. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for item 3 (17).

Now, let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the total valuations based on the given table.
