Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  12  31  66  74
1  55  47   0  96  95
2  18  63  87   5   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here are the valuations:
- Agent 0: 83, 12, 31, 66, 74
- Agent 1: 55, 47, 0, 96, 95
- Agent 2: 18, 63, 87, 5, 0

Let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness and total satisfaction:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Highest value is for Agent 0 (83). 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Highest value is for Agent 2 (63).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Highest value is for Agent 2 (87).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Highest value is for Agent 1 (96).
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Highest value is for Agent 1 (95).
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

The allocations are:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except Agent 0, who only gets one item to maximize their highest valuation), and the overall valuation is maximized based on preferences.

The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
