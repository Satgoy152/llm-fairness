Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31   0  83  64  26
1  44  71  52  16   6
2  53  93  31  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation (83).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1 has the highest valuation (71).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1 is already taken, but item 3 has the second-highest valuation (65).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 4:

4. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0 has a decent valuation (31).
   
5. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 4 has a valuation of 36, which is higher than the remaining item 0's valuation by agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned in a way that the total value for all agents is fairly distributed based on their highest valuations. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
