Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  97  29  67  13
1  47   1  89   9  99
2  36  66  79  93  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items with the highest values according to their preferences. The goal is to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, but we also need to distribute all items among the agents.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 67
  - Item 4: 13

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 1
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 9
  - Item 4: 99

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 93
  - Item 4: 13

To distribute items fairly, we can use the following approach:
1. Assign each agent the item they value the most and ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent.
2. If conflicts arise, try to balance the allocation by considering secondary preferences and ensuring each agent receives a fair share of their preferred items.

Based on the above approach, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (highest value for them)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (highest value for them)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (highest value for them)

Now, allocate the remaining items:
- Agent 0 can get Item 0 (second highest value for them)
- Agent 2 can get Item 2 (second highest value for them)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
