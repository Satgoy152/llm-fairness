Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  66  55  98  89
1  16  23   0  37  94
2  43  41   2  93  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. A possible strategy is to assign items to the agent that values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 at 16, and Agent 2 at 43. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 23, and Agent 2 at 41. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 0, and Agent 2 at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 37, and Agent 2 at 93. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 94, and Agent 2 at 19. Assign to Agent 1.

The allocation based on these decisions is:

- Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
