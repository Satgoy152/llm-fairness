Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  82  31  92  87
1  14  93   4  16  31
2  77  46  64  27  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent has at least one item and all five items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest values for this agent. The highest values for Agent 0 are items 3 (92) and 4 (87).

2. **Agent 1**: After assigning items to Agent 0, Agent 1 should receive the next highest valued items. Agent 1 has high values for item 1 (93).

3. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate the remaining items to Agent 2. Agent 2 has relatively high values for items 0 (77) and 2 (64).

Let's check this allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1: Item 1.
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2.

With this distribution, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
