Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49   0  89  88  38
1  77  98  17  95   9
2  69  12  98  17  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - Agent 2 values it at 69.
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 98.
   - Agent 2 values it at 12.
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89.
   - Agent 1 values it at 17.
   - Agent 2 values it at 98.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Agent 2 values it at 17.
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 9.
   - Agent 2 values it at 49.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives no items, Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3, and Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4. This allocation maximizes the overall valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
