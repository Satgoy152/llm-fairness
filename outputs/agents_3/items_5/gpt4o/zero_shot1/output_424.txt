Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  44   1  28   5
1  60  90  80  68  81
2  31  85  25  20  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's aim to maximize the total satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. We can start by assigning the highest-value items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 60.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 90.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 80.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 68.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 81.

Agent 1 has the highest valuations for all items, but to distribute items fairly, we'll assign items to other agents as well. We can try to distribute the items such that overall satisfaction is maximized and each agent gets items according to their preference.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 90).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 80).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 81).

Agent 1 now has three items with high valuations. Next, we assign the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 31).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 28).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, maximizing the overall valuation for each agent while distributing the items fairly.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
