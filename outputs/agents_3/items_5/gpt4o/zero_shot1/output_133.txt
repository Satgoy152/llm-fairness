Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  37  97  30  19
1  18  42  96  81   4
2  62  88  69  16  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total valuations for each agent are balanced as much as possible. Here, we will use a heuristic approach to achieve a reasonable allocation.

Let's consider each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, as a starting point. Then, we will adjust if necessary to ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items (since there are only 5 items and 3 agents).

Starting with the initial allocation based on maximum valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (62)
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (88)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (97)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (81)
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (70)

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 4]

Now let's adjust as needed:

1. Agent 2 has been allocated 3 items, which is more than desired. 
2. We can transfer Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 is the next highest valuator for Item 0 (49), and this will balance out the allocations.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

This allocation gives each agent a meaningful share based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than two items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
