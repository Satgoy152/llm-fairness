Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  35  88  23  60
1  25   0  96  30  75
2  30  85  30  28  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction or total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent gives to each item and allocate accordingly, if possible.**
2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, but prioritize maximizing the total value.**

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (88).
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (75).
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (85).

Now, we have allocated items 2, 4, and 1. We still need to allocate items 0 and 3.

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 67, which is the highest valuation for that item.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 30, which is the highest valuation for that item.

The allocations are now as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 0
- Agent 1: Items 4, 3
- Agent 2: Item 1

These allocations maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
