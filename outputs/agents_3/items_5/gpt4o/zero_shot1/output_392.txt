Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  36  66  57   6
1   5  37  88  52  69
2  78  14  86  77  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 37 88 52 69]
 [78 14 86 77 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:
- Agent 0: [81, 36, 66, 57, 6]
- Agent 1: [5, 37, 88, 52, 69]
- Agent 2: [78, 14, 86, 77, 76]

One approach is to allocate the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 5.

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 88, highest overall).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 81, highest remaining for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 77, highest remaining for Agent 2).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 69, high value for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 36, remaining item).

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocation is balanced based on the agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
