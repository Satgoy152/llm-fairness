Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  58  81   7  71
1  44  78   3  89  34
2  20  63  74   3  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction, we can use a method that tries to allocate items based on the highest valuations. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Step 1**: List all the valuations with their corresponding agent and item pairs:
   - Agent 0: (0, 75), (1, 58), (2, 81), (3, 7), (4, 71)
   - Agent 1: (0, 44), (1, 78), (2, 3), (3, 89), (4, 34)
   - Agent 2: (0, 20), (1, 63), (2, 74), (3, 3), (4, 11)

2. **Step 2**: Sort these valuations in descending order to prioritize the highest value allocations:
   - (3, 89), (2, 81), (0, 75), (4, 71), (1, 78), (1, 63), (2, 74), (1, 44), (0, 58), (4, 34), (0, 20), (2, 3), (3, 7), (4, 11)

3. **Step 3**: Allocate items based on the sorted list while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and no item is allocated more than once.

4. **Step 4**: Distribute items to maximize overall satisfaction while keeping an eye on fairness.

Here is a fair allocation based on the above steps:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2] because they have high valuations for these items (75 and 81).
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 1] because they have high valuations for these items (89 and 78).
- Agent 2 gets item [4] because, after the above allocations, this is the best remaining item for them (11).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and items are allocated fairly based on the highest available valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
