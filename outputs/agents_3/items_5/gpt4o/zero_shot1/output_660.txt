Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  55  19  30  78
1  89  78   9  87  13
2  23  92  15  65  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 30
  - Item 4: 78

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 87
  - Item 4: 13

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 38

A strategy could involve assigning items based on the highest valuation for each item among the agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 89.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 92.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 19 (among lower valuations).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 87.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation of 78 (since Agent 1 already has two items and Agent 0 has only one).

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 1

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
