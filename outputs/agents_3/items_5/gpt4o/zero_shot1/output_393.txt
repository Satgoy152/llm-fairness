Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  87   4  98  14
1  62  65  10  83  56
2  63  52   3  80  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 and 0 (valuations 98 and 96 respectively).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 and 1 (valuations 83 and 65 respectively).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 and 3 (valuations 78 and 80 respectively).

To ensure each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their satisfaction, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0. This is the highest valuation item for Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the second-highest valuation for Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, which is the highest valuation for Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, which is the second-highest valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, even though it's low-valued, it completes the allocation and gives Agent 1 a second item.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their total satisfaction based on the table. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation balances the need to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed.
