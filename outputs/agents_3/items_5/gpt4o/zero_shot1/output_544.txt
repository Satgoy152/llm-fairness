Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  51  97  23   5
1  92  53  60  83  33
2  26  95  97  65   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we want to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items they are assigned, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Value for items: [41, 51, 97, 23, 5]
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 97)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Value for items: [92, 53, 60, 83, 33]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 92)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Value for items: [26, 95, 97, 65, 3]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 95)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (items 3 and 4):

- Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 3 (value 83)
- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 among the agents who haven't been assigned yet (value 5)

Based on this, we can finalize the allocation as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
