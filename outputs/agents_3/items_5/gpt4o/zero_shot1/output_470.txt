Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  39  92  47  37
1  71  24  82  15  91
2  71  21  59  16  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 71, Agent 2 values it at 71.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 24, Agent 2 values it at 21.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 82, Agent 2 values it at 59.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 15, Agent 2 values it at 16.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 91, Agent 2 values it at 77.

Let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agents 1 and 2 both value it at 71. To break the tie, we can assign it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 39.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 47.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: None

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while adhering to the constraint that only 5 items are allocated in total.
