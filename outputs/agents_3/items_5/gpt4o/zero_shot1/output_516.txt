Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  15  16  21  79
1  10  20  82  73  60
2  91  15  70  69  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here’s a step-by-step way to make the allocation:

1. **Identify high valuations:** Look for the highest values in each agent’s row to ensure they get items they highly value.
2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:** Since there are 3 agents and 5 items, not every agent may get more than one item, but we should aim to distribute them fairly.
3. **Balance valuations:** Try to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

### Valuation Matrix:
```
Agent 0: [79, 15, 16, 21, 79]
Agent 1: [10, 20, 82, 73, 60]
Agent 2: [91, 15, 70, 69, 86]
```

### Allocation Steps:
- **Item 0**: High value for Agent 2 (91).
- **Item 1**: Low value across the board. Assign to Agent 0 (15).
- **Item 2**: Very high value for Agent 1 (82).
- **Item 3**: High value for Agent 1 (73), but Agent 2 values it decently too (69). Assign to Agent 0 (21) as they have fewer items so far.
- **Item 4**: High value for Agent 2 (86).

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Gets items 1 and 3.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 0 and 4.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures a relatively fair distribution while maximizing the total valuation.
