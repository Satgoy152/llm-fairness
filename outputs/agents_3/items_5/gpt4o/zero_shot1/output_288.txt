Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  63  14  75  45
1  59  28  79  61  21
2  65  33  88  60  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Given the small number of items and agents, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent's satisfaction is reasonably balanced while ensuring no items are left unallocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 63, 14, 75, 45]
- Agent 1: [59, 28, 79, 61, 21]
- Agent 2: [65, 33, 88, 60, 56]

Considering these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation (75).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (79).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has a relatively high valuation (65).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the second highest valuation for Agent 0 (63).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it has a relatively high valuation (56).

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations among the agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 1]
- Agent 1 gets item [2]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
