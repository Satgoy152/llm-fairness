Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  19  98  18  63
1  36  55  14  13  44
2  42  58  37  92  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the values given for each agent for each item:

- Agent 0 values: [0, 19, 98, 18, 63]
- Agent 1 values: [36, 55, 14, 13, 44]
- Agent 2 values: [42, 58, 37, 92, 76]

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 0 (98). Let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 2 (92). Let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 2 (76). Let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 2 (58). Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 2 (42). Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, Agent 2 has received 4 items, and Agent 0 has received 1 item. Agent 1 has received no items.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent given the constraints.
