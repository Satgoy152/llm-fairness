Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  50  53  21  20
1  92  83  96   3   3
2  10  93  86  16  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 1. Agent 1 values it at 92, which is the highest among all agents.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 2. Agent 2 values it at 93, which is the highest.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1. Agent 1 values it at 96, the highest.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 0. Agent 0 values it at 21, the highest.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 2. Agent 2 values it at 26, the highest.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations.
