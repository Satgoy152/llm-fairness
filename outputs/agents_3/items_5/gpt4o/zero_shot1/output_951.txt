Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  35  35  15  86
1  50  98  61  70  10
2  95  77  33  78  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to determine the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values for items: 35, 35, 35, 15, 86
   - Highest value is for item 4 (86).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values for items: 50, 98, 61, 70, 10
   - Highest value is for item 1 (98).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values for items: 95, 77, 33, 78, 36
   - Highest value is for item 0 (95).

We can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, and then distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 3:
- For item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 35
  - Agent 1 values it at 61
  - Agent 2 values it at 33
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value).

- For item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 15
  - Agent 1 values it at 70
  - Agent 2 values it at 78
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value).

This provides a fair distribution based on maximizing each agent's received valuation.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
