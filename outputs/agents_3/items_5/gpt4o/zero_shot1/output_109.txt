Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  47  92  36   6
1  51   2  28  13  21
2  43  91  33  63  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll begin by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items and try to allocate accordingly while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values are [29, 47, 92, 36, 6]
- Agent 1: Values are [51, 2, 28, 13, 21]
- Agent 2: Values are [43, 91, 33, 63, 92]

We'll start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (value 92).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 51).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (value 92).

After these initial allocations:

- Agent 0 has item 2
- Agent 1 has item 0
- Agent 2 has item 4

Now we have to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3.

Agent 2's next highest value is item 1 (value 91), which they value significantly, so we'll allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, only item 3 is left. Agent 2 values item 3 the most compared to the other remaining agents, so we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
