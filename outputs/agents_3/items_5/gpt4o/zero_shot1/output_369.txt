Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  97  78  23  21
1  28  23  61  56  14
2  53   0  60  79  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where we try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (97) and Item 2 (78).
   - Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 because it has the highest single valuation across all items.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 2 (61) and Item 3 (56).
   - Since Item 1 is already allocated, let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Item 3 (79), Item 4 (76), and Item 0 (53).
   - Let's allocate Items 4 and 3 to Agent 2. However, Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, so allocate Items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2 is left and has a high valuation for Agent 0. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 2 gets Items 0 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
