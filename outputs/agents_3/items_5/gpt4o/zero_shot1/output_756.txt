Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  16  82   2  74
1   7  16  65  72  26
2  31  44  53  10  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's start by analyzing the valuations and determine a possible fair allocation.

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 82
- Item 3: 2
- Item 4: 74

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 7
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 65
- Item 3: 72
- Item 4: 26

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 10
- Item 4: 55

A fair allocation would consider giving each agent items where their valuation is relatively higher compared to others.

Let's consider the following allocation:
- Agent 0 should receive items where they have high valuations.
- Agent 1 should receive items where they have relatively high valuations.
- Agent 2 should receive items where they have high valuations.

A possible allocation:
1. Agent 0 receives item 2 (valuation 82) and item 4 (valuation 74).
2. Agent 1 receives item 3 (valuation 72).
3. Agent 2 receives item 1 (valuation 44) and item 0 (valuation 31).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
