Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  62  49   8  21
1  96  71   2  56  93
2   3  19   3  86   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm where the highest value items are prioritized for allocation to the agent who values them the most.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89.
   - Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Agent 2 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value: 96).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62.
   - Agent 1 values it at 71.
   - Agent 2 values it at 19.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value: 71).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Agent 2 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value: 49).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8.
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Agent 2 values it at 86.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value: 86).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 93.
   - Agent 2 values it at 0.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value: 93).

Based on this allocation strategy, the results are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total of 5 items is distributed among them.
