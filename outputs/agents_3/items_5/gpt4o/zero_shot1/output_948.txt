Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  68  20  14  24
1   6  26   2  56  16
2  52  21  72  15  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [52 21 72 15 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are assigned. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 1 the highest at 68 and item 0 the second highest at 17. 
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 3 the highest at 56.
3. **Agent 2**: They value items 2 and 4 the highest at 72 each.

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing their satisfaction based on the given valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
