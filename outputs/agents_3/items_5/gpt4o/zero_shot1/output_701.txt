Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  95  84  36  37
1  67  52  63  95  84
2  15   3  72  79  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highly at 95.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it highly at 95.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it highly at 85.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it at 84, and agent 0 already has item 1.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it at 67, which is higher than agent 2's valuation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This distribution maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, agent 1 receives items 0 and 3, and agent 2 receives item 4.
