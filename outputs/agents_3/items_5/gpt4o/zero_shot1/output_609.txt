Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  62  68  30  14
1  33  18  30  29  24
2  33  34  94  21  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. One common approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest value they place on each item. Let's go through the items one by one and assign them accordingly:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89.
   - Agent 1 values it at 33.
   - Agent 2 values it at 33.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62.
   - Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Agent 2 values it at 34.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Agent 2 values it at 94.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30.
   - Agent 1 values it at 29.
   - Agent 2 values it at 21.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Agent 2 values it at 64.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
