Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  52  81   2  99
1  93   4  15  76  62
2  26   0  19  10  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (41), 1 (52), 2 (81), and 4 (99).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (93) and a good valuation for item 3 (76).
3. **Agent 2** has a moderate valuation for item 4 (72).

To distribute the items fairly and maximize each agent's total value, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 4 (valuations 81 and 99).
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 3 (valuations 93 and 76).
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (valuation 0).

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuations for each agent given the constraint of distributing all 5 items. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
