Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  49  74  61  56
1  95  40   7  60  71
2  12  50  45  18  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [12 50 45 18 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. Analyze valuations:
   - Agent 0 values: 45, 49, 74, 61, 56
   - Agent 1 values: 95, 40,  7, 60, 71
   - Agent 2 values: 12, 50, 45, 18, 88

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation:
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (95), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2 (74), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (88), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Now, we have items 1 and 3 left to allocate.

3. Allocate remaining items:
   - For item 1, the highest remaining value is for Agent 2 (50), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - For item 3, the highest remaining value is for Agent 0 (61), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

4. Final allocations:
   - Agent 0: items 2 and 3
   - Agent 1: item 0
   - Agent 2: items 1 and 4

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
