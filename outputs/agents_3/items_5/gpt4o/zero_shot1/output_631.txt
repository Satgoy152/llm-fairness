Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  68  16  50   8
1  29  50  98  39  21
2  67  69  84  76   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 92.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 98.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 at 84, but since Agent 1 values it more, Agent 1 should get item 2.

2. **Fair Allocation Steps:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by any agent).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by any agent).
   - Agent 2 should get an item with a reasonable valuation. Item 3 is valued at 76 by Agent 2, which seems a good fit.
   - Now, allocate the remaining items (1 and 4).

3. **Remaining Allocation:**
   - Item 1 has relatively high values for both Agent 0 and Agent 2. Assign it to Agent 2 since Agent 0 already has a high-value item (0).
   - Item 4 is least valued among available items, assign it to Agent 1 to balance the allocations.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: 0
   - Agent 1: 2, 4
   - Agent 2: 1, 3

The allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
