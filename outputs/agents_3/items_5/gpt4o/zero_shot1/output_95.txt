Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  46  86  54  73
1  47   2  44   7  30
2  32  81   9  43  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [32 81  9 43 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Assign each agent their highest-valued item, if possible.
3. Allocate remaining items based on maximizing the sum of valuations across all agents.

Step-by-step Allocation:

- Agent 0: The highest value is 86 for item 2.
- Agent 1: The highest value is 47 for item 0.
- Agent 2: The highest value is 86 for item 4.

Assign these items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.

Remaining items are 1 and 3. We allocate these to maximize their valuations:

- Agent 0's highest remaining value is 73 for item 4, but it is already taken, so next best is item 3 with value 54.
- Agent 2's highest remaining value is 81 for item 1.

Assign the remaining items:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the sum of valuations is reasonable across all agents.
