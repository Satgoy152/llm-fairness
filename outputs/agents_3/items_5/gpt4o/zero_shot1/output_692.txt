Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  26  41  16   6
1  46  66   3  30   1
2  29  36  41  98  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation of the items each agent receives. We also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, as there are 5 items and 3 agents. Here is one way to do it:

1. Look at the highest valuations for each item across all agents and try to allocate items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item to satisfy the condition of fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the table:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values this item the most at 46.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values this item the most at 66.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values this item the most at 41.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values this item the most at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values this item the most at 61.

However, this allocation leaves Agent 0 without any items, which should be avoided to maintain fairness. Therefore, we need to adjust the allocation as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 1. Agent 0 values item 0 as 25, which is significant enough to ensure fairness.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the most at 66.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 to ensure Agent 0 gets two items as compensation for not getting the highest valued items.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the most at 98.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it the most at 61.

Now, we ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1: Gets item 1.
- Agent 2: Gets items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total items allocated are 5.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
