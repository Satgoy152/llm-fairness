Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  11  29  98  73
1  18  22  79  62  30
2  10  66   7  56  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 22 79 62 30]
 [10 66  7 56 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's break down the valuation table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [77, 11, 29, 98, 73]
- Agent 1's valuations: [18, 22, 79, 62, 30]
- Agent 2's valuations: [10, 66, 7, 56, 90]

To maximize fairness, we can look into allocating items based on higher preferences while considering an equal number of items for each agent.

### Allocation Process:
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 98. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 90. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
  
Now each agent has one item.

For the remaining items, we aim to balance the number of items per agent:
- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0, as they value it at 77.
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2, as they value it at 66, which is the highest among the remaining options for an unassigned agent.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 5 items are distributed while considering each agent's preferences.
