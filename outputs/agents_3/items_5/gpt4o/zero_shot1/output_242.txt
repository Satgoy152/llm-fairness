Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  85   9  39  27
1  10  17  30  55  63
2  90   8  14  67  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [90  8 14 67 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the following approach aiming for efficiency in maximizing the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 1 (85)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (63), Item 3 (55)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (67), Item 4 (66)

Now, let's allocate items to maximize the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 0 (99) and Item 1 (85) since these are the highest for Agent 0 and no other agent values these items as highly.
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 4 (63) and Item 3 (55) since these are the highest for Agent 1 among the remaining unallocated items.
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 2 (14) as Agent 2â€™s highest remaining valued item, though it's the smallest value.

Agent allocations based on the highest individual valuation they receive are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while all items are fairly allocated.
