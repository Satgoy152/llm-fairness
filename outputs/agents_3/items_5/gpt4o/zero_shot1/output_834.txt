Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  83  78  17  22
1  88  60   3  20  82
2  43  90  94  38  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. One approach is to go through the items and assign them to the agent who values them the most and has not yet received an item, if possible.

Let's analyze the item valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 88.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with 90.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with 94.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 17.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 84.

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it the most with 88).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it the most with 90).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it the most with 17).

Now each agent has received at least one item. Let's continue to assign the remaining items:

4. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it the most with 94).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it the most compared to Agent 1).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
