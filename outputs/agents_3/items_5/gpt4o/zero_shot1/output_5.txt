Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  16  76  28  44
1  89  27  93  22  13
2  49  22  65   2  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. We can proceed by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and all agents are considered.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 2** has the highest valuation of 93 by Agent 1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0** has the next highest valuation of 89 by Agent 1, but since Agent 1 already has an item, we consider the next high valuation for Item 0, which is 54 by Agent 0. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 4** has a high valuation of 58 by Agent 2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 1** has a valuation of 27 by Agent 1, but since Agent 1 already has an item, we consider Agent 0 with a valuation of 16. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 3** has a valuation of 28 by Agent 0. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

The allocations can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated in total.
