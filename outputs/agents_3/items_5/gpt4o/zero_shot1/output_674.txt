Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  53  22  58  80
1   7  25  27   1  14
2  46  30  29  34  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple method like maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (73), Item 4 (80) 

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (27), Item 1 (25)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (34), Item 2 (29)

Let's allocate the items based on the highest preferences, ensuring each item is given to only one agent and each agent gets at least one item:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 0
- Give Item 4 to Agent 0
- Give Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2)
- Give Item 1 to Agent 1
- Give Item 3 to Agent 2

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 5, while trying to respect each agent's valuations as much as possible.
