Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  27  30  55   8
1  88  26   7  65  17
2  21  87  95  49  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 26  7 65 17]
 [21 87 95 49 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 with a valuation of 86.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 with a valuation of 88, slightly higher than agent 0.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 with a valuation of 95.

Given these high valuations, the allocations can be distributed as follows:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Now, consider the remaining items: 1, 3, and 4.

For the remaining items:
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 (87), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (65), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 has a higher valuation for item 4 compared to agents 1 and 2, so assign item 4 to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the overall satisfaction based on valuations is maximized.

Here is the final allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
