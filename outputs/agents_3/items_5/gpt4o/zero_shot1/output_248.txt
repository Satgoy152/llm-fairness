Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  39  12  83  90
1  26  23  49  36  11
2  67  81  14  94  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the items and their values for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: Item 0 (35), Item 1 (39), Item 2 (12), Item 3 (83), Item 4 (90)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (26), Item 1 (23), Item 2 (49), Item 3 (36), Item 4 (11)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (67), Item 1 (81), Item 2 (14), Item 3 (94), Item 4 (94)

2. **Assign items to agents by maximizing individual agent's total value:**

   - Agent 0: Highest values are Item 4 (90), Item 3 (83)
   - Agent 1: Highest value is Item 2 (49)
   - Agent 2: Highest values are Item 3 (94), Item 4 (94)

3. **Allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring each item is given to one agent only:**

   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (90) and it doesn't conflict with Agent 2's strongest preference.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it (94).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item (49).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest valued item (81) after Item 3.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is still a decent value for them (35).

4. **Verify allocations:**

   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 2.
   - Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 3.

5. **Ensure all items are allocated:**

   - Total items allocated: 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

6. **Present the allocations in the desired JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, all items are allocated, and the allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives given the constraints.
