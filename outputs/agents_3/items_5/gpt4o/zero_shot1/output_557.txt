Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  82  12  53   6
1  76   6  96  84   4
2  96  77  25  35  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Look at which agent values each item the most.
2. **Allocate Items Accordingly:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the highest.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure that each agent receives at least one item. If an agent doesn’t receive any items, reallocate the least valued item from another agent to this agent.

Let's analyze the table:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (96).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (82).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (84).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (71).

### Initial Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 4

### Fairness Check
Each agent has received at least one item, ensuring fairness.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation method ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while maintaining a fair distribution of items.
