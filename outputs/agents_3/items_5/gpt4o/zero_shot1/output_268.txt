Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  16  85  68  36
1  75  92   3   3  47
2  72  45   0  84  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be thought of as a type of assignment problem where each item should be assigned to exactly one agent.

Here is a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (85).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest (92).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (84).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it high (83) and item 3 is already allocated to agent 2.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest (75) among the unallocated items.

Following this allocation strategy, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their total value.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
