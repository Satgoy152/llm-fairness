Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  35  66  56  42
1  63  36  39  10  84
2  94  74  46  14  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 42
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 0: 14

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 4: 84
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 10

- Agent 2: 
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 4: 68
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 14

Based on these valuations, we can make an allocation that tries to give each agent a high-value item. The allocation should ensure that each agent receives at least one item and maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. Agent 0 receives Item 2 (66), which is their highest-valued item.
2. Agent 1 receives Item 4 (84), which is their highest-valued item.
3. Agent 2 receives Item 0 (94), which is their highest-valued item.

Now, two items remain (Items 1 and 3), and we need to allocate them considering the remaining valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 1: 35

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 3: 10

- Agent 2: 
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 3: 14

Given these, we can allocate the remaining items as follows:

4. Agent 2 receives Item 1 (74), which is highly valued by them.
5. Agent 0 receives Item 3 (56), which is their second-highest remaining option.

Now, let's present the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the items based on the given valuations.
