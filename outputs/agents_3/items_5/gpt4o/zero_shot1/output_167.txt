Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  58   4  53  11
1  86  42  64  72   8
2  81  12  84  17  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 42 64 72  8]
 [81 12 84 17 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value across all agents. Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items accordingly:

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [56, 58, 4, 53, 11]
- Agent 1: [86, 42, 64, 72, 8]
- Agent 2: [81, 12, 84, 17, 89]

We'll attempt to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 86.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 89.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation each agent receives from the items.

Let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4.
