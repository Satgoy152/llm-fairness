Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  37  30  43  65
1  75  43  12  96   7
2   0   0  96  78  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 43 12 96  7]
 [ 0  0 96 78 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  37  30  43  65
1  75  43  12  96   7
2   0   0  96  78  92
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 75.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 37.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 96.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 96.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 92.

Based on these allocations, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and the total valuation is maximized for each agent's allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
