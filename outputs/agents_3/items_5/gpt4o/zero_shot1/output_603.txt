Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  84  14  65  67
1  81  84  28  79  33
2  84  62  24  53  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the values and try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0's highest values: 1 (84), 4 (67)
   - Agent 1's highest values: 0 (81), 1 (84)
   - Agent 2's highest values: 0 (84), 4 (64)

2. Allocate items based on the highest values ensuring no conflict:
   - Agent 0 can take item 1 (84).
   - Agent 1 can take item 0 (81).
   - Agent 2 can take item 4 (64).

3. Allocate remaining items to balance the allocation:
   - Remaining items: 2, 3
   - Agent 0 gets item 3, as it has a high value for them (65).
   - Agent 1 gets item 2, as it has a reasonable value for them (28).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
