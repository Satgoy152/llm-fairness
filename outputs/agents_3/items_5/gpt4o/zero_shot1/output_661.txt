Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  57  26  56  30
1  65  93  66  18  88
2  41  62  62  65  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can try to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is maximized and each agent receives a fair share of the items.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 3 (Value: 56)
   - Item 0 (Value: 21)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 1 (Value: 93)
   - Item 4 (Value: 88)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 2 (Value: 62)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total value for the agents. Let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving a fair amount based on their valuations.
