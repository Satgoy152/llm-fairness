Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  97  26  40  96
1  95  55  57  13  62
2   0  55  36   1   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (72), item 1 very highly (97), and item 4 highly (96).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 very highly (95) and item 2 moderately (57).
3. Agent 2 has the lowest values overall.

A reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4, total value = 97 + 96 = 193.
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2, total value = 95 + 57 = 152.
- Agent 2: Item 3, total value = 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the assignment aims to maximize the total value based on the agents' preferences. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
