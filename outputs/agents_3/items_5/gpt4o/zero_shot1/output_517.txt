Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  52  32  80   9
1  52  15  23  21   4
2  26  94  62  37  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [26 94 62 37 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's examine the valuations provided in the table:

```
Agent 0: [6, 52, 32, 80, 9]
Agent 1: [52, 15, 23, 21, 4]
Agent 2: [26, 94, 62, 37, 57]
```

We'll aim to allocate items such that each agent is assigned items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for item 3 (value 80).
   - Second highest value is for item 1 (value 52).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for item 0 (value 52).
   - Second highest value is for item 2 (value 23).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for item 1 (value 94).
   - Second highest value is for item 2 (value 62).

Now, let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- **Item 3** is allocated to Agent 0 (highest value).
- **Item 0** is allocated to Agent 1 (highest value).
- **Item 1** is allocated to Agent 2 (highest value).

For the remaining items (2 and 4):

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 2 has the highest value (62), so allocate to Agent 2.
  
- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 2 values it the most (57), so allocate to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation

Based on this strategy, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value.
