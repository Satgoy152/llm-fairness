Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  51  96  88   5
1  89   9  76  93  37
2  33  47  95  15  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We need to ensure each agent gets a fair share, considering their preferences and the constraint that only one agent can receive each item.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation for this agent (96).
   - Item 3 is the second-highest valuation (88).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3 has the highest valuation (93), but it is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Item 0 has the next highest valuation (89).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation (95), but it is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Item 4 has the next highest valuation (52).

Considering these, we can assign the items as follows to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 0** gets items [2, 3] with valuations [96, 88].
- **Agent 1** gets item [0] with a valuation of [89].
- **Agent 2** gets items [1, 4] with valuations [47, 52].

Now, putting this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed, with each agent receiving items that reflect their preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.
