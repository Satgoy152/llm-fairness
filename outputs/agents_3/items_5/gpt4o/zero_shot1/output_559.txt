Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  61  21  87   7
1  68  81  34  31  84
2  15  76   8  27  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 93).
   - The second highest is item 3 (value 87).
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 84).
   - The second highest is item 1 (value 81).
   - Allocate items 4 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 1 (value 76), but it's already allocated to Agent 1.
   - The next highest available is item 3 (value 27), but it's already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 (value 8) to Agent 2, as it is the only remaining unallocated item.

Now, we compile this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on the highest available valuations for their preferences, and all items are distributed.
