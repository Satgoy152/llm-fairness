Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  66   4  19  11
1  46   3  23  29  83
2  43  39  89  35  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46  3 23 29 83]
 [43 39 89 35 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [56, 66, 4, 19, 11]
- Agent 1's valuations: [46, 3, 23, 29, 83]
- Agent 2's valuations: [43, 39, 89, 35, 44]

We want to allocate the items to agents such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (66) and item 0 (56).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (83).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 (89).

Considering these preferences, an optimal allocation might be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).

This allocation gives each agent their most valuable items as much as possible without exceeding the total number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
