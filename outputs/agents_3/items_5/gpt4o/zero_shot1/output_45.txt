Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60   5  18  95  12
1  62  24  11  15  39
2  33  38  74   5  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, given their individual valuations for each item. A common approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [60, 5, 18, 95, 12]
- Agent 1 values: [62, 24, 11, 15, 39]
- Agent 2 values: [33, 38, 74, 5, 28]

The goal is to allocate items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 95 for agent 0, which is the highest for this item).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 62 for agent 1, which is the highest for this item).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 74 for agent 2, which is the highest for this item).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 38 for agent 2, which is the highest for this item).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 39 for agent 1, which is the highest for this item).

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
