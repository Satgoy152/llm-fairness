Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  64  25  14   4
1  85  58  16   9   5
2  93  44  20  70  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent is assigned an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent one by one, ensuring fairness.
2. Continue allocating the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations and balancing the allocation among agents.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 82, 64, 25, 14,  4
Agent 1: 85, 58, 16,  9,  5
Agent 2: 93, 44, 20, 70, 42
```

We can proceed as follows:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: This is the highest valued item left after considering Agent 2's highest, and Agent 1's highest.
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: This is the highest valued item left after considering Agent 2's highest.
3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2**: This is the highest valued item left for Agent 2 given that Items 0 and 2 already have higher valuations by other agents.

Now we need to allocate remaining items 0 and 4:

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 93 for item 0.
5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 4.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the 3 agents, considering their valuations as much as possible for fairness.
