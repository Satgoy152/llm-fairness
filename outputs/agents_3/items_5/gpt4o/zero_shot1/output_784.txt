Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  58  13  30  45
1  95  31   1  54  22
2   7  72  58  30   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. One common approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (95).
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (72).
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (58).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (54).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (45).

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:**
   - Agent 0 has Item 4.
   - Agent 1 has Items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 2 has Items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
