Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  67  13  21  29
1  41  16  86  83  73
2  68  20  18  59  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [68 20 18 59 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 has a value of 67.
   - Item 3 has a value of 21.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 has a value of 86.
   - Item 4 has a value of 73.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0 has a value of 68.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable distribution based on their preferences while maintaining fairness. Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item.
