Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  35  96   8  80
1  77  22  19  10  82
2  33  70  81  89  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 22 19 10 82]
 [33 70 81 89 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a solution where the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. A simple approach is to assign the items based on maximizing each agent's preference while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0: [51, 35, 96, 8, 80]
- Agent 1: [77, 22, 19, 10, 82]
- Agent 2: [33, 70, 81, 89, 92]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by assigning the items with the highest unique values to ensure each agent receives at least one item:
   - Item 2 (96) to Agent 0.
   - Item 4 (92) to Agent 2.
   - Item 0 (77) to Agent 1.

2. Allocate remaining items based on the next highest preferences while trying to balance total values:
   - Agent 0 has item 2, so allocate item 1 (70) to Agent 2.
   - Agent 1 has item 0, so allocate item 3 (10) to Agent 1.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
