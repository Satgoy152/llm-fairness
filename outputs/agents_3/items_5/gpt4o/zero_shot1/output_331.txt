Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74   3  91  57  43
1  41  42   6  15  45
2   3  78  79  40  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 42  6 15 45]
 [ 3 78 79 40 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that each agent receives a fair share of total value or the number of items. 

First, let's summarize the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [74, 3, 91, 57, 43]
Agent 1: [41, 42, 6, 15, 45]
Agent 2: [3, 78, 79, 40, 93]
```

We need to assign all 5 items to the agents. One way to do this is to maximize the total value each agent gets. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value of 91 for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value of 93 for Agent 2).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value of 74 for Agent 0).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value of 78 for Agent 2).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has no items yet and this is the only remaining item).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are distributed based on higher valuations where possible.

Now, presenting this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns items such that Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, Agent 1 receives item 3, and Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4.
