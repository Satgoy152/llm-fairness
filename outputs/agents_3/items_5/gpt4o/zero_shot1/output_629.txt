Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  86  87  84  39
1  26  11  98  21  99
2  73  89  28  60   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, and 2, but has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1.

Given these considerations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 96).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value: 99).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value: 89).

Now, we have two items left (items 2 and 3) and need to allocate them to agents who haven't yet received an item or to agents who value them highly:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly compared to the others who already have items, so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since they value it more than Agent 1 does.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
