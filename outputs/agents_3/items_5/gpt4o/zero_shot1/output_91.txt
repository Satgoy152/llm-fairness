Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  24  43  42  24
1  88  76  76  53  82
2  42  17  96  23  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 76 76 53 82]
 [42 17 96 23 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences and values. We aim to distribute items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [59, 24, 43, 42, 24]
Agent 1: [88, 76, 76, 53, 82]
Agent 2: [42, 17, 96, 23, 49]
```

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (88).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (76).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (96).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (53).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (82).

However, we need to ensure all agents are fairly considered and not just maximize the value for one agent. Thus, we aim to balance the allocation:

- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 2 (highest value), as it is significantly higher than others.
- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1 (highest value), considering Agent 1 has high values for multiple items.
- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 0 (though not the highest, ensures Agent 0 gets an item).
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 0 (to balance the allocations better).
- Assign **Item 4** to Agent 1 (high value).

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, with a total of 5 items distributed.
