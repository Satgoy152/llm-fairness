Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  23  56  50  74
1  98  14  51  92  28
2  39  57  91  10  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest with a value of 83.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a value of 98.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest with a value of 91.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Valuations:**
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (value of 98).
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (value of 91).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - After allocating item 0 and item 2, items 1, 3, and 4 are left to be allocated among the agents.
   - Agent 0 has a high value for item 4 (value of 74).
   - Agent 1 has a high value for item 3 (value of 92).

4. **Finalize Allocations:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their valuations of the items while making sure all items are allocated.
