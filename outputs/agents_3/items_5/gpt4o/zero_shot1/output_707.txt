Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1  2   3   4
0   0  36  6   2   8
1   5  65  7  91  82
2  47  80  9  82  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible. Here is one way to approach it:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highest, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highest, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highest, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 3 to Agent 2, but item 3 is taken, so we allocate item 4 which is the next highest value for Agent 2.
4. Now, Agent 1 still needs more items, and they value item 3 highest, but it's allocated, so we allocate item 4, but it's allocated to Agent 2, so we allocate item 0 which is the next highest available.
5. Finally, Agent 0 needs one more item, and for them, item 4 is the next highest available, but it's allocated, so we allocate item 2 which is available.

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the distribution is done fairly based on the valuations provided.

The final allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items have been distributed among the agents while considering their preferences.
