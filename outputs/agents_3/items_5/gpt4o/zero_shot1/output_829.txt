Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  52  45  91  85
1  87  94  80  22  90
2  31  14  92  41  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent, considering each agent should get at least one item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [66, 52, 45, 91, 85]
   - Best item: Item 3 (Value: 91)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [87, 94, 80, 22, 90]
   - Best item: Item 1 (Value: 94)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [31, 14, 92, 41, 45]
   - Best item: Item 2 (Value: 92)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 4) to balance the distribution.

4. **Considering remaining items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest at 87.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 90.

Given these calculations, Agent 1 could take items 0 and 4, as they value them quite highly.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total of 5 items are distributed among the agents.
