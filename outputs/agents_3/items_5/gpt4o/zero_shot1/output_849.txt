Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  58  14  55  55
1  50  23  91   0  40
2  22  17  76   6  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 23 91  0 40]
 [22 17 76  6 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [52, 58, 14, 55, 55]
- Agent 1: [50, 23, 91, 0, 40]
- Agent 2: [22, 17, 76, 6, 28]

To achieve a fair allocation, consider the highest valuation each agent has for the items and allocate accordingly, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and all items are distributed.

1. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 2 at 91, the highest valuation for any item among all agents.

2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 1 at 58, and no other agent values Item 1 higher.

3. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 4 at 55, which is equal to their valuation for Item 3, but they already have a higher value for Item 4 than other agents.

4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 0 at 52, higher than any other agent.

5. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: After the above allocations, Item 3's highest valuation among the remaining options is by Agent 2 at 6.

Now, all items are allocated, and all agents have an integer number of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
