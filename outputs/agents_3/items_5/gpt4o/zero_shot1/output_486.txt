Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  15  59  15  80
1  73  92  34  50  25
2   9  74  77  36  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 9 74 77 36 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute the items such that the total value is maximized for each agent, yet all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations to find a suitable allocation:

- Agent 0: Values are [67, 15, 59, 15, 80]
- Agent 1: Values are [73, 92, 34, 50, 25]
- Agent 2: Values are [9, 74, 77, 36, 70]

### Possible Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (80). 

2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (92). 

3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (77).

4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 0 second highest (73).

5. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 higher than Agent 0 and equally with Agent 1, but Agent 2 already has fewer items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value received by each agent given their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
