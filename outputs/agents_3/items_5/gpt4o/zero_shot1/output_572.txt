Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  16   0   2  74
1  57  25   4  57  79
2  99  16  35  85  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the five items among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Evaluate the highest valuations for each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation if possible.
2. Check to ensure a fair distribution and all items are allocated.

Let's break down the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 16, along with Agent 2, but Agent 0 has a lower cumulative valuation, so assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at the highest at 4.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 85.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 79.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent, and the total number of items allocated is five.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
