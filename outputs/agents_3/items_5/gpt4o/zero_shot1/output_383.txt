Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52   6  86   1  94
1  42  36  21  62  28
2  47  81  44  30  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items so that the allocations are as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Has a relatively balanced valuation but highest for item 3.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Has high valuations for items 1 and 4.

Now, let's try to allocate these items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring fairness:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (since 94 is the highest valuation for item 4 among all agents).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since 52 is the highest valuation for item 0 among all agents).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (since 62 is the highest valuation for item 3 among all agents).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (since 81 is the highest valuation for item 1 among all agents).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (since 86 is the highest valuation for item 2 among all agents).

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
