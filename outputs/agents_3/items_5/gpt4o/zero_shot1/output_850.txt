Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  51  18  81  51
1  20  77  90  37  94
2  79  55  55  79   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 43
  - Agent 1 values it at 20
  - Agent 2 values it at 79
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 51
  - Agent 1 values it at 77
  - Agent 2 values it at 55
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 18
  - Agent 1 values it at 90
  - Agent 2 values it at 55
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 81
  - Agent 1 values it at 37
  - Agent 2 values it at 79
  - Assign to Agent 0

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 51
  - Agent 1 values it at 94
  - Agent 2 values it at 5
  - Assign to Agent 1

Based on the above evaluation, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
