Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  95  37  40  75
1  87  20  11  30   1
2  16  73  52  59   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (58), Item 1 (95), Item 2 (37), Item 3 (40), Item 4 (75)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (87), Item 1 (20), Item 2 (11), Item 3 (30), Item 4 (1)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (16), Item 1 (73), Item 2 (52), Item 3 (59), Item 4 (6)

2. **Prioritize High Valuations:**
   - Identify which items have the highest valuations for each agent.
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent gets more than two items initially and all items are allocated.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (87)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (95)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (52)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (59)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (75)

4. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - Verify that each agent gets at least one item if possible. In this case, Agent 1 only gets one item, but given the constraints and high valuation, this is optimal.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, given the constraints.
