Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  57  32  27  38
1  72  89  38  30  97
2   1   6  88  44  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1  6 88 44 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. Here is one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Assign item 0 (value 52)
   - Assign item 1 (value 57)

2. Agent 1:
   - Assign item 4 (value 97)
   - Assign item 3 (value 30)

3. Agent 2:
   - Assign item 2 (value 88)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are distributed.
