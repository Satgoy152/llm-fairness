Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  72  88  69  93
1  35  41  55  18   0
2  78  55  23   4  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. We should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total sum of values for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 4. Let's allocate items 0, 1, and 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a decent valuation for item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 can get item 3 as it's the remaining item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned at least one item, and all 5 items have been allocated.
