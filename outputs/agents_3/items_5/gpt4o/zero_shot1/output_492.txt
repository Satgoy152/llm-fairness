Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  96  29  49  41
1  88  83   7  91  13
2  58  85  43  13  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [75, 96, 29, 49, 41]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [88, 83, 7, 91, 13]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [58, 85, 43, 13, 34]

The goal is to maximize the total valuation by allocating the items to the agents. A possible approach is to allocate the highest-value items to the agents who value them the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 91.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 88.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 96.
4. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 43.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 41.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
