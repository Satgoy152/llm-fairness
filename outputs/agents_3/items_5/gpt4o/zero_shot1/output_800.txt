Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  83  86  34  73
1  21  16  35  73  97
2  59  50  74  42  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item when possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 40.
   - Agent 1 values it at 21.
   - Agent 2 values it at 59.
   - **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2** (highest value).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 83.
   - Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Agent 2 values it at 50.
   - **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0** (highest value).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Agent 2 values it at 74.
   - **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0** (highest value).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34.
   - Agent 1 values it at 73.
   - Agent 2 values it at 42.
   - **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1** (highest value).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Agent 2 values it at 47.
   - **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1** (highest value).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated.
