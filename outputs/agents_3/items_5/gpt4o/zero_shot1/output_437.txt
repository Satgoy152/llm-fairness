Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  46  74  40  35
1  31  35  81  31  60
2  44  58   0  19  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that seeks to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will try to make sure that each agent gets a fair share of the overall value of the items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 80, 46, 74, 40, 35
- Agent 1 values: 31, 35, 81, 31, 60
- Agent 2 values: 44, 58, 0, 19, 37

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on them while ensuring fairness. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1**: Prioritize item 2 for Agent 1, as this is their highest value (81).
2. **Agent 0**: Next, allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as this is their highest value (80).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as this is their highest value (58).
4. Now we have allocated 3 items, with 2 remaining.

For the remaining items, we should consider the next highest unallocated values for each agent:

5. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 60).
6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 40).

Now, all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is based on maximizing the perceived value for each agent as much as possible given the constraints.
