Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  58  37  88  21
1  20   2  83  44  21
2  32  40  35  29  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20  2 83 44 21]
 [32 40 35 29 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items that are valued highly by each agent. Given the matrix of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  58  37  88  21
1  20   2  83  44  21
2  32  40  35  29  74
```

We will aim to assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring that each agent receives a fair number of items if possible.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (92).
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (58).
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from agent 1 (83).
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (88).
5. Item 4 has the highest valuation from agent 2 (74).

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent the item they value most highly among the remaining unallocated items at each step.
