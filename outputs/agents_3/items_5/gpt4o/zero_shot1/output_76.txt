Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  31  50  12  73
1  34  93  27   4  97
2  63  72  49  15  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. We want to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible. Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. **Agent Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [11, 31, 50, 12, 73]
   - Agent 1: [34, 93, 27, 4, 97]
   - Agent 2: [63, 72, 49, 15, 57]

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Try to assign the highest-valued items to each agent in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0:
     - Item 4 (value 73)
   - Agent 1:
     - Item 1 (value 93)
     - Item 3 (value 4)
   - Agent 2:
     - Item 0 (value 63)
     - Item 2 (value 49)

4. **Rationale:**
   - Agent 0 receives the highest-valued item for them, as it maximizes their individual satisfaction.
   - Agent 1 receives their highest-valued item and an additional low-value item to balance the number of items.
   - Agent 2 receives two items that together are competitively valued.

5. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences and maximizes overall satisfaction.
