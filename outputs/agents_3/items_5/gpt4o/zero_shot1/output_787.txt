Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  98  90  65  23
1  84  66  41  84  54
2  47  68  22  97  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's consider the preferences of each agent and allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (98), item 2 next (90), item 3 after that (65), item 4 next (23), and item 0 the least (3).
- Agent 1 values item 0 and item 3 equally the most (84 each), item 1 next (66), item 4 after that (54), and item 2 the least (41).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97), item 4 next (81), item 1 after that (68), item 0 next (47), and item 2 the least (22).

A potential fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (98) and item 2 (90), which they value the highest.
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (84), which they value the most, and item 4 (54).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (97), which they value the highest.

This allocation gives each agent items they value highly, and all 5 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
