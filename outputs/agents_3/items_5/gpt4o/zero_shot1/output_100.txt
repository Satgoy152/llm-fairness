Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  11   0  43  74
1   9  72  16  71  90
2  69  79  78  36  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.
2. Continue allocating the remaining items to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's go through the process:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (74).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (90), but item 4 is already taken by Agent 0, so next highest is item 1 (72).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (79), but item 1 is taken by Agent 1, so next highest is item 2 (78).

Now that each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize their respective valuations:

- **Remaining items**: 0, 3
  - Agent 0 could take item 3 (43) instead of item 0 (2)
  - Agent 2 could take item 3 (36) instead of item 0 (69), but assigning item 0 to Agent 0 maximizes their allocation.

Assign items based on maximizing the assignment:
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 and item 3 (total valuation: 74 + 43 = 117)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (total valuation: 72)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 and item 0 (total valuation: 78 + 69 = 147)

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent gets the highest possible valuation for their items while distributing all the items.
