Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  28  48  11  26
1  95  51  87  40  68
2  81  21  50  94  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations for each item by each agent:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0: 74, Agent 1: 95, Agent 2: 81
   - Item 1: Agent 0: 28, Agent 1: 51, Agent 2: 21
   - Item 2: Agent 0: 48, Agent 1: 87, Agent 2: 50
   - Item 3: Agent 0: 11, Agent 1: 40, Agent 2: 94
   - Item 4: Agent 0: 26, Agent 1: 68, Agent 2: 18

2. **Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:**

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (value 95)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (value 51)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 87)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 94)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 68)

3. **Adjust to ensure fair distribution:**

   Agent 1 gets four items, whereas Agents 0 and 2 should get at least one item each to ensure fairness.

   - Reassign Item 0 to Agent 0, who values it second-highest after Agent 1.

4. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Item 0
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4
   - Agent 2: Item 3

5. **Present the allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are fairly distributed.
