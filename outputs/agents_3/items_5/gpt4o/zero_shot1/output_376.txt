Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  23  44  96  65
1  37  47  21  25  62
2  24  31  40  52   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider distributing the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the overall allocation tries to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.

A potential approach is to assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, but ensuring that the distribution remains fair. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 0 (96). So, assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 0 (44). So, assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 1 (47). So, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 0 (65), but since Agent 0 already has two items, let's assign it to the second highest, Agent 1 (62).
5. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 0 (36), but since Agent 0 already has two items, let's assign it to the second highest, Agent 1 (37). However, Agent 1 already has two items, so let's assign it to Agent 2 (24), who has no items yet.

Here's how the allocation looks:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
