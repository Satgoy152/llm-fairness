Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  48  29  34  87
1  50   8  97  14  10
2  64  84  10  81  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we can approach this problem:

1. **Identify High Value Matches:** Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has for any item, as these are likely to contribute to a fair and high-value allocation.

2. **Consideration for Fairness:** Since fairness might imply an equitable distribution of items, we'll also try to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given the high-value consideration.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest with a value of 87.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest with a value of 97.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest with a value of 84.

4. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - After initial high-value allocations, we still have items 0 and 3 remaining. We should assign these based on the next highest valuations:
     - Agent 2 also values item 3 relatively high (81).
     - Agent 0 values item 0 higher than Agent 1 does (4 vs 50).

5. **Final Allocation:**

Based on the above considerations, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner consistent with maximizing their individual valuations, while also aiming for a fair distribution. Agent 2 receives three items because they have relatively high valuations for multiple remaining items after the first allocation.
