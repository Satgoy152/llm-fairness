Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  22  66  28  55
1  55  21  51  55  35
2  50  16  47  67  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of the others, if possible. Given the valuations, let's consider the highest value each agent assigns to any item and try to allocate accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**
   - Highest value: 89 for item 0
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**
   - Highest value: 55 for item 0 and item 3
   - Item 0 is already allocated. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**
   - Highest value: 87 for item 4
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 3, and 4. We still need to allocate items 1 and 2.

4. **Remaining items: 1 and 2**

   - For item 1:
     - Agent 0 values it at 22
     - Agent 1 values it at 21
     - Agent 2 values it at 16
     - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

   - For item 2:
     - Agent 0 values it at 66
     - Agent 1 values it at 51
     - Agent 2 values it at 47
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to reflect the highest value items for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.
