Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  74   6  19  78
1  37  76  17  54  62
2  47  25  71  42  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (78), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (76), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (71), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
  
With the remaining items (0 and 3), we can consider the next highest valuations:

- Agent 2 values item 3 at 42, which is higher than the other agents' valuations for item 3. Therefore, we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 37, which is higher than the other agents' valuations for item 0. Therefore, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations for the unallocated items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
