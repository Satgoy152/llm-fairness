Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  26  33  69  31
1  73  50  72  79  40
2  21   3  34  96  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a form of the "greedy" algorithm, where we assign items based on maximizing the value for each agent until all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because it has the highest valuation (96).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because it has the highest remaining valuation (73).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because it has the next highest remaining valuation (72).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because it has the next highest remaining valuation (75).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 0 because it has the highest remaining valuation for agent 0 (26).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4.
