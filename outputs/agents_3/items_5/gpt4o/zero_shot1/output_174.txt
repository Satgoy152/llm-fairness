Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  93   5  51  23
1  60  57  94  67  25
2  93  47  18  60   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value received by each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 93.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 93.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 94.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 67.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 23.

2. Assign items to agents based on these highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Following these steps, here is a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals 5.
