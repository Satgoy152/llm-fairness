Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  95  72  89  21
1  72  51  38  81  53
2  86  81  80  12  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to allocate items in such a way that the total valuation for each agent is maximized while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 72
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 4: 21

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 38
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 53

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 46

Using this data, we can allocate the items as follows to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:
   - Highest valuation for Agent 0 (95).

2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2:
   - Highest valuation for Agent 2 (86).

3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:
   - Highest valuation for Agent 1 (81).

4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2:
   - Second-highest valuation for Agent 2 (80).

5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1:
   - Second-highest valuation for Agent 1 (53).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly among the agents while maximizing their total valuations.
