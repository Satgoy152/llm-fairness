Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  48  91  75  30
1   5  70  76  50  47
2  39  43   6  63  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method like the max-min fairness approach. This approach aims to maximize the minimum utility received by any agent. We will start by examining the values each agent places on each item and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes fairness.

Here are the valuations again for reference:

- Agent 0: [47, 48, 91, 75, 30]
- Agent 1: [5, 70, 76, 50, 47]
- Agent 2: [39, 43, 6, 63, 64]

Let's consider the allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (91).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (70).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it highly (64).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it second highest (75).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the second highest (39).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to balance the total value obtained by each agent as fairly as possible:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3 with values [91, 75].
- Agent 1 receives item 1 with value [70].
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 0 with values [64, 39].

The allocation in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
