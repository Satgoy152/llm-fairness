Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  99  32  99  42
1  86  93  23  98  99
2  42  18  22   8  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 and item 3 the highest, both at 99.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 99.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, but it is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2, which has a value of 42.

4. For the remaining items:
   - **Item 2:** 
     - Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 23, and Agent 2 at 22.
     - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
   - **Item 3:** 
     - Agent 0 values it at 99, and Agent 1 values it at 98.
     - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

The allocations based on these considerations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
