Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  75  96  55   6
1  74  94  77  80  44
2  93  68  26  62  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to balance the total values each agent receives. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 0 and 2. The values are 30 and 96, totaling 126.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items 1 and 3. The values are 94 and 80, totaling 174.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 4. The value is 81.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Below is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
