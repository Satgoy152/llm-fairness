Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  88  74  53  44
1  33  47  92  15  16
2  91  70  32  52   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we can use an approach that ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the overall distribution reflects the agents' valuations for the items. One way to achieve this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring no agent receives more than one item than the others if possible.

Let's start by identifying the agent with the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 91.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 88.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 92.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 53.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44.

Using this method, we can initially assign the items as follows to maximize the total valuation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, we have 2 more items (Items 3 and 4) to allocate. To ensure fairness, let's distribute these items considering the agents' current allocations:

- Agent 0 has 1 item (Item 1).
- Agent 1 has 1 item (Item 2).
- Agent 2 has 1 item (Item 0).

We'll assign the remaining items to maintain balance:

4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 now has 2 items).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 now has 2 items).

Now each agent has either 1 or 2 items, and all 5 items are allocated. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
