Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  87  52  12  70
1  26  58   3   3  15
2  53   7  28  37  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness. We can approach this by assigning items based on the highest valuation each agent has, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and making sure no items are left unallocated.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (87) and 4 (70).
- Agent 1 has relatively high valuations compared to their other valuations for item 0 (26) and item 1 (58).
- Agent 2 values item 0 (53) highly and has moderate valuations for items 2 (28) and 4 (49).

An allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest value.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is relatively high for Agent 2 and allows Agent 0 to get a different item.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest value and it balances the total valuation among agents.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it balances the distribution and Agent 1 has fewer high-value options.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and items are distributed based on relatively high valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
