Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  31  83  95   8
1  42  33  58  23  62
2  73  18  18  39  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 31 83 95  8]
 [42 33 58 23 62]
 [73 18 18 39 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to optimize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given the valuations:

```
     0   1   2   3   4
0   70  31  83  95   8
1   42  33  58  23  62
2   73  18  18  39  60
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value of 95 for Agent 0.
   - Item 2 has the second-highest value of 83 for Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 has the highest value of 62 for Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0 has the highest value of 73 for Agent 2.
   - Item 1 has the second-highest value of 18 for Agent 2.

This allocation maximizes the values for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
