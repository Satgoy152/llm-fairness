Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  34  24  60  67
1  70  88  10  49  87
2  29  32  52  36  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Matches:** Look for the highest individual valuations first, ensuring that the overall allocation is fair and balanced.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item:** Try to allocate at least one item to each agent if possible, while still considering the highest values.
3. **Avoid Conflicts:** Ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 60
  - Item 4: 67

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 49
  - Item 4: 87

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 36
  - Item 4: 59

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Agent 0 should receive Item 0 (highest value of 88).
2. Agent 1 should receive Item 1 (highest value of 88).
3. Agent 2 should receive Item 2 (highest value of 52).
4. Agent 1 should receive Item 4 (second-highest value for Agent 1, value of 87).
5. Agent 0 should receive Item 3 (second-highest value for Agent 0, value of 60).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated remains exactly 5.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
