Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  18  55  91   1
1  59  94  95  53  76
2  73  33  72  50  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 76.

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuations:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Balancing allocation:**
   - Currently, Agent 1 has 3 items, Agent 0 has 1 item, and Agent 2 has 1 item.
   - To ensure fairness, we can slightly adjust the allocation to balance the number of items.

4. **Adjusting for fairness:**
   - Swap Item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 0. This reduces Agent 1's items and gives Agent 0 more value.

Final allocation based on fairness while trying to maximize valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives Item 0.

This distribution gives each agent at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
