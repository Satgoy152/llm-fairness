Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  37  41  95  30
1  28  44   3  91  63
2  70  78  37  59   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Given valuations:

- Agent 0: [78, 37, 41, 95, 30]
- Agent 1: [28, 44, 3, 91, 63]
- Agent 2: [70, 78, 37, 59, 4]

Let's assign items to agents based on maximizing their total valuations across the board:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (95).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After item 3, the highest remaining value for Agent 1 is item 4 (63).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation for Agent 2 is for item 1 (78).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

With items 1, 3, and 4 assigned, we have two items left to allocate: 0 and 2.

4. **Remaining items 0 and 2**: 
   - Item 0: Valuations are 78 (Agent 0), 28 (Agent 1), and 70 (Agent 2).
   - Item 2: Valuations are 41 (Agent 0), 3 (Agent 1), and 37 (Agent 2).

To maximize the remaining values:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation (78).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 0 already has two items, and Agent 2's valuation (37) is higher than Agent 1's (3).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: 3, 0
- Agent 1: 4
- Agent 2: 1, 2

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
