Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  59   4  33  96
1   5  16  27  78  40
2   8  82  74  28  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation each agent has for their allocated items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3.
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.

2. **Assigning Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because they value it highly (78).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because they value it highly (96).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because they value it highly (78).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 because they value it highly (82).

3. **Allocate Remaining Item:**
   - The remaining item is 2. Agent 2 values it more than Agent 0 and 1, so assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations and the total of 5 items is allocated.

Allocations in the required JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
