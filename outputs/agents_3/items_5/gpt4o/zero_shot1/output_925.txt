Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  28  14  61   5
1  77  43  57  10   4
2  82  21  86  57  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here are the valuations for reference:

```
Agent 0: 65, 28, 14, 61, 5
Agent 1: 77, 43, 57, 10, 4
Agent 2: 82, 21, 86, 57, 42
```

First, let's sort the items by value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (65), Item 3 (61), Item 1 (28), Item 2 (14), Item 4 (5)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (77), Item 2 (57), Item 1 (43), Item 3 (10), Item 4 (4)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (86), Item 0 (82), Item 3 (57), Item 4 (42), Item 1 (21)

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items:

1. Item 0: Valued most by Agent 2 (82)
2. Item 1: Valued most by Agent 1 (43)
3. Item 2: Valued most by Agent 2 (86)
4. Item 3: Valued most by Agent 0 (61)
5. Item 4: Valued most by Agent 2 (42)

However, since Agent 2 would get three items in this scenario, which might not be fair, we need to adjust the allocation to ensure a fair distribution. Let's adjust it:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1

This way, each agent gets a reasonable allocation based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4
- Agent 2 receives item 0

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while all items are allocated.
