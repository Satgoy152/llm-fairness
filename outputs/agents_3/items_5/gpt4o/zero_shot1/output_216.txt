Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  29   8   3  16
1  42  10  68   4  67
2  61  43  50  94  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated. We can use the valuations to guide the allocation, trying to maximize the total value for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 35. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 68. Let's allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 94. Let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, and 3, leaving items 1 and 4 to be allocated.

4. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - For item 1, agent 2 has the highest valuation of 43. Let's allocate item 1 to agent 2.
   - For item 4, agent 1 has the highest valuation of 67. Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
