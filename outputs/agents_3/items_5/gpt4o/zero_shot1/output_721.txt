Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41   5   0   9  78
1  96  97   3  21  90
2  12  89  17  62  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. We aim to assign the items in such a way that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the situation:

- Agent 0 has high valuation for item 4 (78).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4 (96, 97, 90).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 3 (89, 62).

Considering these valuations, one way to allocate the items fairly is:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, since it's their highest valued item.
2. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 1, as these have the highest valuations for this agent.
3. Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2, as they have reasonable valuations for these items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, while all items are allocated.

Here's the proposed allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
