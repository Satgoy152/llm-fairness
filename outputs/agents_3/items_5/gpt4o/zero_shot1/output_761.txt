Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  73  93  34  93
1   4  78   7  64  40
2  94   4  99  75  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. This is a form of the "assignment problem," which can be solved using various methods, such as the Hungarian algorithm.

Let's evaluate the problem intuitively based on the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 82
- Item 1: 73
- Item 2: 93
- Item 3: 34
- Item 4: 93

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 4
- Item 1: 78
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 64
- Item 4: 40

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 94
- Item 1: 4
- Item 2: 99
- Item 3: 75
- Item 4: 31

The goal is to allocate these items to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring only 5 items are allocated in total.

A possible allocation is:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 93 (item 2) + 93 (item 4) = 186
- Agent 1: 78 (item 1) 
- Agent 2: 94 (item 0) + 75 (item 3) = 169

This allocation seems to fairly distribute items based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
