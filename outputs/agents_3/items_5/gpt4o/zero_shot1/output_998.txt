Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  70  94  16  22
1  19  59  97   0  66
2  97   5  96  31   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a strategy to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** shows high valuation for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 and reasonably high for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** shows high valuation for item 0 and item 2, but also has a reasonable valuation for item 3.

Using a heuristic approach such as maximizing individual agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated, we can assign items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2 are highly valued by Agent 0, but item 2 is more highly valued by Agent 1. Therefore, assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1, so it should go to them.
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 2 were already claimed by Agents 0 and 1 respectively. Item 3 has a reasonable value for Agent 2, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4. Considering the remaining high valuations:

- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 0 as they have a reasonable valuation for it.
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1 as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

Thus, the allocation can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
