Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  85  41  86  40
1  40  13  95  57  88
2  87  17  31  19  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. One method is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 87
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41
   - Agent 1 values it at 95
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

Based on the above allocations, here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also distributing the items fairly among the agents.
