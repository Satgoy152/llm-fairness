Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  97  24  97  39
1   5  86  19   8  91
2  96  48  20  29  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 86 19  8 91]
 [96 48 20 29 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0** Values: [96, 97, 24, 97, 39]
2. **Agent 1** Values: [5, 86, 19, 8, 91]
3. **Agent 2** Values: [96, 48, 20, 29, 78]

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's look at the highest valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 0.

Let's assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 96 for Agent 2, which is the highest available).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 97 for Agent 0, which is the highest available).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 97 for Agent 0, which is the highest available).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 91 for Agent 1, which is the highest available).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 20 for Agent 2, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 19).

Now each agent has been allocated items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
