Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  80  41  22  86
1  57  69  75   8  55
2  52  55  46  85  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach is to use a "max-min" strategy, which aims to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (80) and 4 (86). 
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (75).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3 (85).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, and 3. We need to allocate two more items (0 and 4), ensuring a fair distribution:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (86).

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they have a moderate value for it (57), and it balances their allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
