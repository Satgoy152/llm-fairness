Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  67  26  23  37
1  43  14  84  90  53
2  31   6  91  62  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 14 84 90 53]
 [31  6 91 62 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or value) that each agent receives from their assigned items. This involves finding a distribution of items that considers each agent's valuations.

Let's examine the valuations matrix:
- Agent 0: [5, 67, 26, 23, 37]
- Agent 1: [43, 14, 84, 90, 53]
- Agent 2: [31, 6, 91, 62, 61]

We can use a greedy approach to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 90) because it's the highest value in the matrix.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 91) because it's the highest remaining value.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 67) because it's the highest remaining value.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 61) because it's the highest remaining value after item 1 is assigned.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 43) because it's the highest remaining value after item 4 is assigned.

This allocation ensures that every agent gets a maximum value from the items assigned to them.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
