Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  49  88   5  47
1  53  75  55  71   1
2  97   9  97  67   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [53 75 55 71  1]
 [97  9 97 67  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to assign items such that each agent gets an approximately fair share of the total value, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. 

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 58, 49, 88, 5, 47
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 53, 75, 55, 71, 1
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: 97, 9, 97, 67, 5

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing individual satisfaction:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 75.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 88.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 71.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 47.

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
