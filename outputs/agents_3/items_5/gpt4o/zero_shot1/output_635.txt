Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  80  41  93  67
1  64  78  55  78  89
2  41  57  11  92  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 78 55 78 89]
 [41 57 11 92 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize total happiness by assigning items to the agent who values them the most. Let's go through the valuation table and assign the items accordingly:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value of 93 for Agent 0. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 4** has the highest value of 93 for Agent 2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1** has the highest value of 80 for Agent 0. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 0** has the highest value of 64 for Agent 1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2** has the highest value of 55 for Agent 1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now let's put these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
