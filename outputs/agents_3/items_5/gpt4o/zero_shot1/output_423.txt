Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  70  59  44  82
1  96  80  74  25  18
2  89  74  73  20  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items. A fair allocation could prioritize maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents according to their valuations.

Let's examine the table to find an allocation that gives each agent a reasonable share of the total value:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 82, so we can allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 96, so we can allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 89 and item 4 at 86. Since item 0 is already allocated, we can allocate item 2 to agent 2, which they value at 73.

Next, we identify the remaining items (1 and 3) and allocate them fairly:

- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 70, and Agent 1 values it at 80. Agent 2 values it at 74. Allocate item 1 to agent 1 because they have the highest valuation.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 25, and Agent 2 values it at 20. Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

The allocations, therefore, will be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.
