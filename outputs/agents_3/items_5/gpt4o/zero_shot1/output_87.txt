Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  71  21  79  56
1  24  56  18  96  13
2  28  63  75  75  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can consider the preferences and valuations given in the table. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is balanced, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - High valuations: Item 3 (79), Item 0 (71), Item 1 (71)
- **Agent 1:**
  - High valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 1 (56), Item 0 (24)
- **Agent 2:**
  - High valuations: Item 2 (75), Item 3 (75), Item 4 (70)

Considering the above, one potential fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (96).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (71) and it's their second-highest preference.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 to complement their allocation, as it also has a high valuation for them (71).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item (75).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as it complements their allocation with a high valuation (70).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to respect their highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
