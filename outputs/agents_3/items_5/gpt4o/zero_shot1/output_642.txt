Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  44  88  77  10
1  47  18  47  13  21
2  43  19  79  64  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to the items:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 64
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 77
- Item 4: 10

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 47
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 47
- Item 3: 13
- Item 4: 21

Agent 2 values:
- Item 0: 43
- Item 1: 19
- Item 2: 79
- Item 3: 64
- Item 4: 42

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize fairness by ensuring that each agent gets the items they value the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (88) and item 3 (77).
2. Agent 1 can take item 0 (47), which is their highest value.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 (79), but since Agent 0 already has it, they can get item 3 (64) and item 4 (42).

Now, let's ensure that no items are left unallocated and each agent receives at least one item or a fair share:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets the items they value the most within the constraints of fairness.
