Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  45   1  90  86
1  33   9  31  83  53
2   4  35  58  95  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences for the items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value the most while distributing all items fairly:

- Agent 0 will receive items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 will receive item 2.
- Agent 2 will receive items 1 and 3.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their highly valued items, and all items are distributed.
