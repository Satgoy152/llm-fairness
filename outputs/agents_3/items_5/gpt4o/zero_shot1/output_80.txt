Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  51  16  74  71
1   5  58  86   4  55
2  74  39  98  78  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's use a simple method where we start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. 

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Agent 2 values it at 98
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 71
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 30
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

Now, let's compile the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and is based on their individual valuations.
