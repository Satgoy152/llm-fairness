Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  10  52  81  87
1  41  69  45  88  57
2   7  23  45  55  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 7 23 45 55 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 1, since agent 1 values item 3 the highest (88).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 0, since agent 0 values item 4 the highest (87).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, since agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 2 (52).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 1, since agent 1 values item 1 highly (69).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 2, since this will ensure each agent gets at least one item, and agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (7) compared to other unallocated items.

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items, considering each agent's preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
