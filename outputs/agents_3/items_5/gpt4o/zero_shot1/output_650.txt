Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  31  93  37  49
1  23  56  73   8  60
2  12  46  90  49  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use a method such as the "maximum sum" approach, where we aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value assigned given each agent's preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [18, 31, 93, 37, 49]
Agent 1: [23, 56, 73, 8, 60]
Agent 2: [12, 46, 90, 49, 48]
```

We can try to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is only allocated once and each agent ends up with an integer number of items. We'll start by assigning the highest valued items and work downwards.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (93).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (60).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (49).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. Agent 1 values item 1 next highest (56).
5. Agent 0 values item 0 next highest (18).

Allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 0]
- Agent 1: [4, 1]
- Agent 2: [3]

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocation also aims to maximize the total value received by all agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
