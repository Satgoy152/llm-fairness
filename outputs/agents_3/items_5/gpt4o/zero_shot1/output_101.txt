Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  37  96   2  53
1  92  83  93  50  12
2  70   2  81  95  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is a possible allocation based on the given values:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a value of 96.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a value of 92.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a value of 95.

After allocating these high-value items, we still need to assign items 1 and 4.

- For item 1, Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 83.
- For item 4, Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 87.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4

The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
