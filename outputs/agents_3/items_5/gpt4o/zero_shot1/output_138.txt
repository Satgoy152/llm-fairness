Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  73  32  39   6
1  13   9  14  17  65
2  10  43  63  47  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Evaluate Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (76).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (65).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (63).

2. **Assign Highest Valuation Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
   - Considering the next highest valuations:
     - For item 1: Agent 0 (73), Agent 2 (43).
     - For item 3: Agent 2 (47), Agent 0 (39).

4. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 73).

5. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest remaining valuation of 47).

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the highest valuations for each agent as much as possible while ensuring all items are distributed. Each agent receives an integer number of items, with Agent 1 receiving only one item due to their highest valuation on a single item.
