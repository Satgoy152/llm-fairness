Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  69  35  86  94
1  82  81  12  28  40
2   7  10  58  96  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 69 35 86 94]
 [82 81 12 28 40]
 [ 7 10 58 96 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will attempt to assign items to agents in a way that each agent receives at least one item and the total valuation for each agent is balanced as far as possible.

### Valuation Matrix
```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
------------------------------
   0       | 96  69  35  86  94
   1       | 82  81  12  28  40
   2       |  7  10  58  96  32
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 4 (94), Item 3 (86). 
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (81), Item 0 (82).
   - Since Item 0 is already allocated, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 2 (58).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 since Item 3 has the highest valuation and Item 2 is not yet allocated.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2 is not yet allocated and has a decent valuation of 35 for Agent 0 and 58 for Agent 2. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 to balance Agent 2's overall allocation.

### Allocations

Based on the above considerations, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution reflects an attempt at balancing the total valuations in a fair manner.
