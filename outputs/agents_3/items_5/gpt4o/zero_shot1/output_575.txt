Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  41  46  39  19
1  25   1  89  45  87
2  93  80  74  65   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (46)
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 4 (87)
   
3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 1 (80)

Let's try to allocate the items based on these preferences while ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets an integer number of items.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Allocate Item 0 (99)
- Agent 1: Allocate Item 2 (89) and Item 4 (87)
- Agent 2: Allocate Item 1 (80) and Item 3 (65)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and maximizes the value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
