Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  60  97  11  69
1   4   0  42  95  23
2  64  69  36  13  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [26, 60, 97, 11, 69]
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (97)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [4, 0, 42, 95, 23]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (95)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [64, 69, 36, 13, 74]
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (74)

Next, we allocate one high-value item to each agent:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2

Now, we still have Items 0 and 1 to allocate:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (64), so allocate it to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (60), so allocate it to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while each item is allocated only once.
