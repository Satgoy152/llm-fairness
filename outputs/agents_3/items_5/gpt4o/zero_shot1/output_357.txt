Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  19  13  99  16
1  10  62  79  11  26
2  47  54  49  89  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0, with a value of 99.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1, with a value of 79.
   - Item 1 is also a high value for Agent 1, with a value of 62.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2, with a value of 47.
   - Item 4 is also a reasonable choice for Agent 2, with a value of 11.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and all items are distributed. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This distribution maximizes overall satisfaction by giving each agent the items they value the most, based on the table provided.
