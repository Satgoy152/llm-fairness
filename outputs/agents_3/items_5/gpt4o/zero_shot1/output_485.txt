Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  93  42  27  65
1  20  47   9  85  62
2  49  60  55  88   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value according to their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives approximately an equal number of items.
3. Reassign items if necessary to ensure fairness in the number of items allocated to each agent.

Using this approach, let's analyze the table:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (49).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (42).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (88).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (65).

If we assign based purely on maximum valuation:
- Agent 0 would get items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1 would get no items
- Agent 2 would get items [0, 3]

Now, let's modify it to ensure a fair allocation in terms of number of items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it the second most)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (given Agent 0 already has two items)

This results in:
- Agent 0 gets items [1, 2]
- Agent 1 gets item [3]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 4]

This allocation is fair in terms of the number of items each agent gets and maximizes their total value based on their preferences. Here's the JSON format output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
