Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  83  58  58  65
1  90  17  59  40  52
2  65  91  43  15  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 17 59 40 52]
 [65 91 43 15 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. 

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [90, 83, 58, 58, 65]
- Agent 1: [90, 17, 59, 40, 52]
- Agent 2: [65, 91, 43, 15, 78]

A possible approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations per agent for unallocated items. 

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, since both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it at 90, but Agent 0 seems to have higher overall valuations for their top item.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 91.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, since their next highest valuation is for this item at 59.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, since their valuation of 58 is the highest among the unallocated items.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, since their valuation of 78 is the highest among the unallocated items.

The allocations based on this logic would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while distributing all five items.
