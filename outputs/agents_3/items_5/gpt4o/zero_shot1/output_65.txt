Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  98  52   4  10
1  45  54  48  99  10
2  59  13  99  72  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total satisfaction. A common approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 98.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 99.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 99.

Now, for the remaining items 0 and 4, we can allocate them to maximize fairness and satisfaction:

4. Item 0 has the highest value for agent 2 at 59, so we allocate it to agent 2.
5. Item 4 has the highest value for agent 2 at 34, so we allocate it to agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share, with agent 2 getting more items due to higher valuations.
