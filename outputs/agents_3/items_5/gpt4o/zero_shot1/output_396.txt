Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  30   7  22  35
1  31  83   2  88  29
2   8  59  46  85  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuations across all agents. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 0 (value 65).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is for item 3 (value 88).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is for item 3 (value 85). However, since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we choose the next highest valuation for Agent 2, which is item 4 (value 62).

Now, let’s allocate the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 0.
  - The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 4 (value 35). However, item 4 is allocated to Agent 2, so we choose item 1 (value 30).

- **Agent 1:** Already has item 3.
  - The next highest valuation for Agent 1, after item 3, is item 1 (value 83). However, item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, so we choose item 2 (value 2).

- **Agent 2:** Already has item 4.
  - The next highest valuation for Agent 2, after item 4, is item 1 (value 59). However, item 1 is allocated to Agent 0, so we choose item 2 (value 46).

Re-checking allocations, make sure every agent has at least one item and no item is allocated more than once:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [4, 2]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
