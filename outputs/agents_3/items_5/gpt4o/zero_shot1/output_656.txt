Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  51   1  60  15
1  59  88   3  91  16
2  30  54  19  14  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items, aiming to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are distributed.

Here's how we can allocate the items optimally based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (77), Item 3 (60)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 1 (88)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 1 (54)

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 77)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 91)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 88)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 97)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 1) as it has the least impact on total valuation

Now, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total valuation is maximized while also ensuring a fair distribution among the agents.
