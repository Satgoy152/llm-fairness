Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35   5  99  10  66
1  81  27  91  35  59
2  29  33  68  36  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (value 91), but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we look for the next highest value, which is item 0 (value 81).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 70).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3:

- **Item 1**:  
  - Agent 0 values it at 5
  - Agent 1 values it at 27
  - Agent 2 values it at 33  
  The highest value is for Agent 2.

- **Item 3**:  
  - Agent 0 values it at 10
  - Agent 1 values it at 35
  - Agent 2 values it at 36  
  The highest value is for Agent 2.

Based on this allocation strategy, here are the final assignments:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
