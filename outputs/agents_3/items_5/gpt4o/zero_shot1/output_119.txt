Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  37  60  22  79
1  83  59  46  27  12
2  18  37  68  81  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 59 46 27 12]
 [18 37 68 81 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider each agent's valuation of the items:

```
Agent 0: [47, 37, 60, 22, 79]
Agent 1: [83, 59, 46, 27, 12]
Agent 2: [18, 37, 68, 81, 35]
```

We will allocate items by considering each agent's highest valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (83).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (81).

Now, let's allocate these items first:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Next, we allocate the remaining items (1 and 2):

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 60.
  - Agent 1 values it at 46.
  - Agent 2 values it at 68. 

  Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest.

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 37.
  - Agent 1 values it at 59.
  - Agent 2 values it at 37.

  Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest.

Thus, the final allocation looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
