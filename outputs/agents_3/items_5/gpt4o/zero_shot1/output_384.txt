Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  28  39  59  44
1   5  48  23  11  16
2   7  59   8  96  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Maximum Valuation per Item**: Determine which agent values each item the most.

2. **Allocation Strategy**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items based on the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 30
  - Agent 1 values at 5
  - Agent 2 values at 7
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (value 30 is the highest)

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 28
  - Agent 1 values at 48
  - Agent 2 values at 59
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 59 is the highest)

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 39
  - Agent 1 values at 23
  - Agent 2 values at 8
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (value 39 is the highest)

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 59
  - Agent 1 values at 11
  - Agent 2 values at 96
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 96 is the highest)

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 44
  - Agent 1 values at 16
  - Agent 2 values at 21
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (value 44 is the highest)

Based on the above evaluations, the allocations can be made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned fairly to maximize each agent's valuation.
