Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  41  16  45   1
1  59  14  30  21  97
2  96  65  10  52  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (49), Item 3 (45), Item 1 (41)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (59), Item 2 (30)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 4 (71), Item 3 (52)

Let's attempt to allocate items in a way that gives each agent a fair share of value:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3
  - Total valuation: 49 (Item 0) + 45 (Item 3) = 94

- **Agent 1:** Item 4
  - Total valuation: 97 (Item 4)

- **Agent 2:** Items 1, 2
  - Total valuation: 65 (Item 1) + 10 (Item 2) = 75

This distribution provides a fair allocation based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
