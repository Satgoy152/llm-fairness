Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61   6  77  60  69
1  42  47  46  36  52
2  76  59  37   6  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [76 59 37  6 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has a moderate valuation across items, with the highest value for items 1 and 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 0 and 1.

Considering these valuations, a fair allocation that maximizes the total value for all agents could be:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value for each agent is relatively balanced according to their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
