Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  75   0  43  35
1   5  49  69  76  85
2  67  33   6  25  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all five items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 19
   - Item 1: 75
   - Item 2: 0
   - Item 3: 43
   - Item 4: 35

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 5
   - Item 1: 49
   - Item 2: 69
   - Item 3: 76
   - Item 4: 85

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 67
   - Item 1: 33
   - Item 2: 6
   - Item 3: 25
   - Item 4: 53

By examining the highest values for each agent, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value of 75).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value of 85).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value of 67).

Now, there are two items left (Item 2 and Item 3), and we must allocate them to agents while maintaining fairness and maximizing their valuations:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value of 76).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value of 69).

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
