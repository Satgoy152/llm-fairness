Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  38  79  12  94
1  87  29  37  82  17
2  28  12  11   1  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets. However, we should ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible since there are three agents and five items.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 43, 38, 79, 12, 94
   - Highest values: 94, 79

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 87, 29, 37, 82, 17
   - Highest values: 87, 82

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 28, 12, 11, 1, 27
   - Highest values: 28, 27

Considering the highest value items for each agent, we can try to allocate the most valued items to each agent until all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 94)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 82)
- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 79)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 12)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
