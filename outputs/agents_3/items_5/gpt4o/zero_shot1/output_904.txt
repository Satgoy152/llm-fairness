Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  20  84  25  97
1  16  90  87  25  21
2  49  20  14  99   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 20 84 25 97]
 [16 90 87 25 21]
 [49 20 14 99  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are assigned. The goal is to ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least some value from their assigned items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [92, 20, 84, 25, 97]
- Agent 1: [16, 90, 87, 25, 21]
- Agent 2: [49, 20, 14, 99, 1]

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (92)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (87)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (99), Item 1 (20)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 receives items with values [97, 92]
- Agent 1 receives an item with a value [87]
- Agent 2 receives items with values [99, 20]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with the highest possible values from their perspective, while all items are distributed.
