Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  31  31  41  83
1   2  52  75  18  65
2  74  51  12  48   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we start by considering each agent's valuation of each item and attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (89).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (75).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (74), but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest available valuation is for item 1 (51).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3 and 4):

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 41.
     - Agent 1 values it at 18.
     - Agent 2 values it at 48.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since it has the highest valuation for this item.
   
5. **Remaining Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 83.
   - Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Agent 2 values it at 8.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0, who has the highest valuation for this item.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the 3 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
