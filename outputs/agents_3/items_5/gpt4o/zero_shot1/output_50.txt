Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  92  15  69  97
1  64  18  70  34  99
2  75  18  83  36  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. A fair allocation would ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations for guidance on allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 69
  - Item 4: 97

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 99

- Agent 2: 
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 36
  - Item 4: 91

A reasonable strategy is to allocate items according to the highest valuation for each item. Let's go through the items:

1. Item 0: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 2 (75).

2. Item 1:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 0 (92).

3. Item 2:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 2 (83).

4. Item 3:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 0 (69).

5. Item 4:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99).

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents based on the above selections:

- Agent 0 would get items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 would get item 4.
- Agent 2 would get items 0 and 2.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
