Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  76  64  68  29
1  73   0  91  96  11
2  51  52  57  16  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [51 52 57 16 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuation while distributing all 5 items. We can use a simple method to assign items based on the highest valuation per item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (73).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (76).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (91).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (96).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (88).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and maximizes the total valuation. Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
