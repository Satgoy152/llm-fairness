Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  66  26  87  86
1  85  38  39  11  80
2  32  24  43  50  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy approach where we assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, but ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through each item and assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item, keeping track of the allocations to ensure fairness.

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 89
   - Agent 1: 85
   - Agent 2: 32
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 66
   - Agent 1: 38
   - Agent 2: 24
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 26
   - Agent 1: 39
   - Agent 2: 43
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 87
   - Agent 1: 11
   - Agent 2: 50
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 86
   - Agent 1: 80
   - Agent 2: 73
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. Adjust the allocations if needed:

- Agent 0 has 4 items (0, 1, 3, 4).
- Agent 1 has 0 items.
- Agent 2 has 1 item (2).

To ensure fairness, let's reallocate one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1. We choose the item with the lowest valuation differential for Agent 0:

- Transfer item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it more than item 0, 3, or 4).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [2]

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
