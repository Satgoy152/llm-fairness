Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  96  84  22  28
1  62  59   8  90  70
2  56  21  72  65  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [56 21 72 65 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation of the items received by each agent. Let's analyze the given valuations to aim for a fair distribution:

Valuations:
```
Agent 0: [76, 96, 84, 22, 28]
Agent 1: [62, 59, 8, 90, 70]
Agent 2: [56, 21, 72, 65, 81]
```

We can start by allocating the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 62
   - Agent 2 values it at 56
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Agent 2 values it at 21
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 72
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 81
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
