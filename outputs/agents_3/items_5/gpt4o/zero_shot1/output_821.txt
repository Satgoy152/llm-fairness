Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  10  14  48  13
1  55  75  13  30   8
2  15  61  42  26  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 75 13 30  8]
 [15 61 42 26 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total utility (sum of valuations) for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. Agent 0's valuations: [20, 10, 14, 48, 13]
2. Agent 1's valuations: [55, 75, 13, 30, 8]
3. Agent 2's valuations: [15, 61, 42, 26, 15]

A reasonable strategy would be to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 55, which is the highest.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 75, which is the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 42, which is the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 48, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 15, but since Agent 1 already has two items and we want to distribute fairly, we can give it to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
