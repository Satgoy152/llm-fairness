Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  51  51  95  38
1  13   2  16  27  18
2  25  41  51  55  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of the items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (95), and fairly high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Since agent 0 values item 3 significantly higher than the others, it makes sense to allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has relatively low valuations for all items compared to the other agents. Giving them items with lower valuations by other agents can help balance the allocation. Items 0 and 4 have lower relative valuations for agent 1, but since item 0 is highly valued by agent 0, we can give agent 1 item 4.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 4, but since item 4 has already been allocated to agent 1, we can allocate items 1 and 2 to agent 2, which are still high-value items for them.

Based on this reasoning, here is a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to maximize the individual agents' valuations. Note that this is just one possible solution based on the given valuations.
