Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  36  85  77  23
1  88  52  29  63  14
2  47  74  74  36   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would look based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 97)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 74)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Agent 1 values it at 29
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 85)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Agent 2 values it at 36
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 77)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 23)

The items have been allocated based on the highest valuations, resulting in the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it most highly, creating a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.
