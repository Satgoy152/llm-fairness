Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  24  75  75  70
1  61  47  71  18  67
2   5   6  50  64  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations of the items by each agent, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations compared to the other agents.

Based on this analysis, an optimal allocation can be:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 61).
- Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 0 (values 75 and 70).
- Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1 (values 47 and 18).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and it also tries to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing the total value each agent receives while distributing all items among the agents.
