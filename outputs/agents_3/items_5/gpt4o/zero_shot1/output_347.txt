Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  64   8  66  78
1  21  22  67  47  83
2  22  30  10  45  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize total satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Matches:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations by a particular agent compared to others.

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Total Value:** Aim to allocate items such that the sum of the values each agent receives is maximized.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Ensure that all five items are assigned, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  64   8  66  78
1  21  22  67  47  83
2  22  30  10  45  53
```

- **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (78).
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (83).
- **Agent 2** values item 4 moderately (53).

To maximize fairness and total value, let's consider the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High value for item 3 (66) and item 0 (51).
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value for item 4 (83) and high value for item 2 (67).
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Allocate item 1, as it's left, and Agent 2 values it moderately (30).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
