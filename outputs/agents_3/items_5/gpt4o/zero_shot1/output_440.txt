Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  32  27  25  30
1  57  36  10  15  33
2   7  77  39  51  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total valuation of the items they receive. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents to understand the "competition" for each item.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring fairness in the total valuation received by each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: 6 (Agent 0), 57 (Agent 1), 7 (Agent 2)
- Item 1: 32 (Agent 0), 36 (Agent 1), 77 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: 27 (Agent 0), 10 (Agent 1), 39 (Agent 2)
- Item 3: 25 (Agent 0), 15 (Agent 1), 51 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: 30 (Agent 0), 33 (Agent 1), 13 (Agent 2)

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (57). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has a high valuation for Item 1 (77). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 values Item 4 (30) the most compared to other items, and it's a decent valuation. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 2 values Item 3 (51) substantially. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. Now only Item 2 remains. Agent 2 has the highest valuation (39) for Item 2 compared to other agents. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

Based on this allocation strategy, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 3

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
