Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  69  14  94  88
1  86  34  74   3  91
2  15  55  84  46  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent with respect to their preferences. We will try to allocate items so that the total perceived values are as high as possible for each agent. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. 
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.

We will try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's perceived value:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 96).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value: 69).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value: 84).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value: 94).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value: 91).

This allocation tries to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
``` 

This allocation method ensures the items are distributed fairly based on the valuations provided.
