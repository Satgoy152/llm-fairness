Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  80  59  61  19
1  97  12  53  57  20
2  90  45  26  81   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. We need to consider the total number of items, which is 5, and distribute them among 3 agents.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [16, 80, 59, 61, 19]
- Agent 1 values: [97, 12, 53, 57, 20]
- Agent 2 values: [90, 45, 26, 81, 8]

By observing the valuations, we can allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High value for item 1 (80), item 3 (61)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High value for item 0 (97), item 2 (53)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High value for item 3 (81), item 0 (90)

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it the highest (97).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because they value it the highest (80).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because they have a high valuation (53) and they already have item 0, making it efficient.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 because they value it the highest (81).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because they have a reasonable valuation (19) and they already have item 1, making it efficient.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations.
