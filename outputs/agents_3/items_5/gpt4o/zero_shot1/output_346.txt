Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  73  28  91  17
1  74  74  41  86  29
2  18  94  74   1  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the Maximum Weighted Matching in a Bipartite Graph, but since this is a small example, we can manually assign the items to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-------------------------------
    0      | 90  73  28  91  17
    1      | 74  74  41  86  29
    2      | 18  94  74   1  93
```

We aim to allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0 (91). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 has a high value for Agent 1 (74), but Agent 1 also highly values Item 1 (74) equally. For now, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 2 (94). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 2 and 4 are left. Check the remaining capacity and values for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Item 2 (28), Item 4 (17)
     - Agent 1: Item 2 (41), Item 4 (29)
     - Agent 2: Item 2 (74), Item 4 (93)

   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value 93).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (41).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
