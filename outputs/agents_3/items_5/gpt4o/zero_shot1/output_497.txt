Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  11  14  72   3
1  13  62  59  24  51
2  15   6  34  32  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the table:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 75 | 11 | 14 | 72 | 3  |
| 1          | 13 | 62 | 59 | 24 | 51 |
| 2          | 15 | 6  | 34 | 32 | 16 |

We can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for items 0 and 3. Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 would maximize their benefit significantly.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 2. Allocating items 1 and 2 to Agent 1 would give them good satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 3, but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we allocate item 4 to Agent 2, which is their next best option.

Now we ensure that each agent has a fair allocation and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

Hereâ€™s a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and all items are allocated.

The JSON format of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
