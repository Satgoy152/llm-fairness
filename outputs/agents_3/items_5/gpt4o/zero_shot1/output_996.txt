Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  22  89   7  83
1  97  59  77   0  45
2  90  38  28  54  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 38 28 54 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

The valuations are as follows:
- Agent 0: [87, 22, 89, 7, 83]
- Agent 1: [97, 59, 77, 0, 45]
- Agent 2: [90, 38, 28, 54, 90]

To maximize fairness and value, we'll try to assign items based on highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 97, highest).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 89, highest among unallocated).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 90, highest among unallocated).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 54, highest among unallocated for Agent 2 who has only one item so far).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 59, highest among unallocated for Agent 1 who has only one item so far).

Resulting allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [4, 3]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
