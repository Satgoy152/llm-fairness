Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  80  56  80  11
1  75   3  70  83  25
2  70  53  20  37  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: First, identify which agent values each item the most and try to allocate the item to that agent.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given their highest valuation preferences.
3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most.

Following this strategy:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 75.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 70.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 2 receives Item 4.

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is fair based on the highest valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
