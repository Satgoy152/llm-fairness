Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  50  84  97  79
1  55  60  61  54  82
2  54  17  60   2  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can look at the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair total valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [40, 50, 84, 97, 79]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [55, 60, 61, 54, 82]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [54, 17, 60, 2, 89]

Total valuations for each agent are:

- Agent 0: 350
- Agent 1: 312
- Agent 2: 222

We aim to allocate the items based on maximizing the overall fairness in terms of value distribution:

1. Allocate items to Agent 0:
   - Item 3 (value 97)
   - Item 2 (value 84)

2. Allocate items to Agent 1:
   - Item 4 (value 82)
   - Item 1 (value 60)

3. Allocate item to Agent 2:
   - Item 0 (value 54)

This allocation attempts to balance the values each agent receives.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
