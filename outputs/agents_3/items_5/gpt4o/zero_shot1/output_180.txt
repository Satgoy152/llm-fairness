Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  61  65  18  11
1  48  92  73  81   1
2  88  23  26  37  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 12
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 2: 65
   - Item 3: 18
   - Item 4: 11

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 48
   - Item 1: 92
   - Item 2: 73
   - Item 3: 81
   - Item 4: 1

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 88
   - Item 1: 23
   - Item 2: 26
   - Item 3: 37
   - Item 4: 28

**Strategy:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

- Item 0: Highest value is from Agent 2 (88).
- Item 1: Highest value is from Agent 1 (92).
- Item 2: Highest value is from Agent 1 (73).
- Item 3: Highest value is from Agent 1 (81).
- Item 4: Highest value is from Agent 2 (28).

However, assigning all items strictly by highest valuation would not leave any items for Agent 0. To ensure fairness, we need to adjust the allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 1, because Agent 0's next highest value item is Item 3 (18), and Agent 1 can still benefit from Items 1 and 2 with higher valuations.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

**JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
