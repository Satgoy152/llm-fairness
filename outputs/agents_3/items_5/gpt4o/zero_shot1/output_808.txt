Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  99  97  89  36
1   7  65  76  15   3
2  14  89  64  77   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or valuation) for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and no more than 5 items are allocated in total. Let's go through the valuation matrix to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3. Let's prioritize them for these items.
2. **Agent 1** has their highest valuation for item 2, but since this has already been prioritized for Agent 0, we will consider other items. They should be given item 1 due to their relatively high valuation for it.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1, but again, it's prioritized for Agent 0. Instead, they should receive item 3 which has their second highest valuation.

Let's assign the items based on these considerations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it compared to other agents.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it maximizes their total valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has a high valuation for it and it's left unallocated.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively higher valuation for it than other unallocated items.

Now, let's allocate the items according to these decisions:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
