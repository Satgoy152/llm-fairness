Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  94  42   1  85
1  86  20  33  20  13
2   6  39  71  29  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A fair allocation can be achieved by maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 4.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 2.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3.

Based on these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 1 and item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 0 and item 2 to agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some of the items they value most while distributing the items fairly across all agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
