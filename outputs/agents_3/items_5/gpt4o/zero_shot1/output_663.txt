Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  28  78  56  81
1  59  94  76  83  51
2  30  72   7  17  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [30 72  7 17 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can look for a way to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. One possible approach is to start by assigning the highest-valued items to the agents that value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 78)
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3 (values 94 and 83)
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4 (values 30 and 75)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, and all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
