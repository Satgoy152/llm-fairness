Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  97  13  92  50
1  41  69  40  31  23
2  36  83  58  25  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This approach involves the following steps:

1. **Rank Items by Value for Each Agent**: Determine the order of preference for each item by each agent based on their valuations.

2. **Initial Assignment**:
   - Assign each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been already assigned to another agent. This ensures each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Remaining Items Allocation**:
   - Allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each item is assigned only once.

Let's go through this process:

1. **Item Valuations**:

- Agent 0: [29, 97, 13, 92, 50]
- Agent 1: [41, 69, 40, 31, 23]
- Agent 2: [36, 83, 58, 25, 63]

2. **Initial Assignment**:

- Agent 0's highest value is 97 (item 1).
- Agent 1's highest value is 69 (item 1, but it's already taken, so next highest is 41 for item 0).
- Agent 2's highest value is 83 (item 1, but it's already taken, so next highest is 63 for item 4).

After the initial assignment:
- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.

3. **Remaining Items Allocation**:

- Remaining items: 2, 3.
- Agent 0 values these as 13, 92.
- Agent 1 values these as 40, 31.
- Agent 2 values these as 58, 25.

Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value: 92).
Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value: 58).

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.
