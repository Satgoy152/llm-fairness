Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  82  77  58  24
1   2  52  70  55  38
2  70  62   3  37  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 52 70 55 38]
 [70 62  3 37 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the valuation table again:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4
0           76  82  77  58  24
1            2  52  70  55  38
2           70  62   3  37  28
```

An optimal allocation might be as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 82).
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3 (values 70 and 55).
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4 (values 70 and 28).

This allocation ensures that the agents receive items they value highly, balancing the overall satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Total value = 82
- Agent 1: Total value = 125
- Agent 2: Total value = 98

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences.
