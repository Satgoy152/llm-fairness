Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  73  99  11  11
1  15   8  41  52  52
2  30  38  23  48  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. 
2. Agent 1 values item 3 and item 4 the same. 
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.

Considering these valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Give item 0 to agent 0, who values it highly.
- Give item 1 to agent 0, who values it highly.
- Give item 2 to agent 0, who values it highly.
- Give item 3 to agent 1.
- Give item 4 to agent 2, who values it the highest.

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences and the highest possible total valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
