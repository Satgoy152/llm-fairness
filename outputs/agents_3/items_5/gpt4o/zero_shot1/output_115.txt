Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  87  60  81  77
1  75  18   5   6  32
2  21  87  87  99  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and strive to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This is a type of fair division problem.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. However, item 1 is highly valued by multiple agents, and item 3 is most valued by agent 2. Therefore, allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has its highest valuation for item 0, but since it is allocated to agent 0, we should allocate item 4 to agent 1, which is its next highest valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has its highest valuation for item 3, which should be allocated to maximize their satisfaction. Additionally, items 1 and 2 are highly valued by agent 2.

Revising the allocations to ensure that every agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is five:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Allocate items 1, 2, and 3 to agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and uses all five items. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
