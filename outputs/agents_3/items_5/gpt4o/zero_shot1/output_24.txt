Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  49  61  25  85
1  12  53  23  55  78
2  49  92  78  79  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 53 23 55 78]
 [49 92 78 79 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum valuation each agent gets, or ensuring that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly compared to the others.

Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  49  61  25  85
1  12  53  23  55  78
2  49  92  78  79  68
```

We need to allocate all 5 items to the 3 agents. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 as it is the highest valued item for them (85).
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 since it is the highest valued item for them that hasn't been allocated yet (55).
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 since it's the highest valued item for them (92).
4. For the remaining items (0 and 2), we need to consider who values them most among the agents who have received fewer items or have lower total value.

Continuing with the allocation:

4. Agent 2: Allocate item 2, as Agent 2 values it higher than the others (78).
5. Agent 0: Allocate item 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 and it balances the number of items (40).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while also considering the numerical balance of items distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
