Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  45  93  36  11
1  76  86  33   6  86
2  59  54  49  91  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing all the items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (93), so item 2 should be allocated to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 and item 4 equally high (86). To maintain fairness and ensure all items are distributed, let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (91), so item 3 should be allocated to agent 2.
4. Now, we have items 0 and 4 remaining. Agent 1 values item 0 at 76 and item 4 at 86, which are both high values, but since agent 0 only has one item, we can give item 0 to agent 0.
5. Lastly, item 4, which is highly valued by agent 1, will go to agent 1.

Thus, the items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.
