Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  98  63  61  94
1  38  14  74  27  20
2  19  15  16  99  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by giving each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the valuations look:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 38, Agent 2 at 19.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 14, Agent 2 at 15.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 at 74, Agent 2 at 16.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 27, Agent 2 at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 20, Agent 2 at 53.

Let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 38 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 74 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 0.

Now, we ensure each agent gets at least one item and distribute them accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
