Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  21  29  18  37
1  12   9  64  28  58
2  61  52  94   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [61 52 94  8 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's look at the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  21  29  18  37
1  12   9  64  28  58
2  61  52  94   8  88
```

One approach is to assign the items based on the highest value for each item across all agents:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 61 by agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 52 by agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 94 by agent 2.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 28 by agent 1.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 88 by agent 2.

If we allocate all of agent 2's highest value items, agent 2 would receive all items, which wouldn't be fair to agents 0 and 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

Let's try to allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 61).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 21).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 64).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 18).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 58).

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of the total value. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to distribute the total value fairly across all agents.
