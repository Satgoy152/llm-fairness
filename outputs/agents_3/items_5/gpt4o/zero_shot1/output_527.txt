Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  56  80  11  56
1  95  43  88   7  50
2  91  66  77  65  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring no agent receives more than one item initially.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed fairly and maximize total agent satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 95)
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 66)
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 80)
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 65)
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 97)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
