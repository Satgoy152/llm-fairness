Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  47  20   1  81
1  29   6  28  91   9
2  67  18  35  27   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the breakdown:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 29, and Agent 2 at 67. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 6, and Agent 2 at 18. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 28, and Agent 2 at 35. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 91, and Agent 2 at 27. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 at 9, and Agent 2 at 3. Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
