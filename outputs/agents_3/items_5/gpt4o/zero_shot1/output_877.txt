Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  38  84   7  17
1  94  47  93  86   3
2  79  92  62   7  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use an algorithm like the "Greedy Allocation" method. This involves assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process for the given table:

1. Assign item 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 98
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 94
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 79
   - Item 0 goes to Agent 0

2. Assign item 1:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 38
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 47
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 92
   - Item 1 goes to Agent 2

3. Assign item 2:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 84
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 93
   - Agent 2 values item 2 at 62
   - Item 2 goes to Agent 1

4. Assign item 3:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 7
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 86
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 7
   - Item 3 goes to Agent 1

5. Assign item 4:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 17
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 3
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 16
   - Item 4 goes to Agent 0

Now we have the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3
- Agent 2 gets item 1

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
