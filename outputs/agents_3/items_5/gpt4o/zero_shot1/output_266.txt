Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  38  68  25  21
1  53  65  37  92  86
2  46  56   0  84  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. One strategy is to maximize each agent's value by considering their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Item 2 (68)
   - Item 0 (50)
   - Item 1 (38)
   - Item 3 (25)
   - Item 4 (21)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Item 3 (92)
   - Item 4 (86)
   - Item 1 (65)
   - Item 0 (53)
   - Item 2 (37)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Item 3 (84)
   - Item 4 (72)
   - Item 1 (56)
   - Item 0 (46)
   - Item 2 (0)

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring every item is allocated once. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 0].
  - Values: 68 (item 2) + 50 (item 0) = 118
- Agent 1 receives item [3].
  - Value: 92 (item 3)
- Agent 2 receives items [4, 1].
  - Values: 72 (item 4) + 56 (item 1) = 128

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible given their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
