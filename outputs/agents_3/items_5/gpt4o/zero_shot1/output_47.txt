Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34   0  55  35  81
1   6  38  96   3  10
2  49   9  26  80  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. We can employ a strategy that aims to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent may receive at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [34, 0, 55, 35, 81]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 4 (81)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [6, 38, 96, 3, 10]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 2 (96)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [49, 9, 26, 80, 98]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 4 (98), but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest-valued item: Item 3 (80)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets Item 4.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3.

For the remaining items (0 and 1):

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 34.
  - Agent 1 values it at 6.
  - Agent 2 values it at 49.
  - Allocate to Agent 2 since they value it the highest.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 0.
  - Agent 1 values it at 38.
  - Agent 2 values it at 9.
  - Allocate to Agent 1 since they value it the highest.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the valuations as much as possible. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
