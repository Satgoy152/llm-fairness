Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  67  75  54  95
1  69  72  65  12  25
2  62  62  50  75  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by considering the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: highest valuations are for item 4 (95), item 2 (75), and item 1 (67).
- Agent 1: highest valuations are for item 1 (72), item 0 (69), and item 2 (65).
- Agent 2: highest valuations are for item 4 (82), item 3 (75), and item 0 (62).

A feasible allocation should balance the interests of all agents. Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Assign item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (95).
2. **Assign item 3 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 3 highly (75).
3. **Assign item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (72).
4. **Assign item 0 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 0 the next highest (69).
5. **Assign item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 2 highly (75).

This allocation considers the higher individual valuations for each item and ensures each agent receives at least one item. Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, maximizing the total value across the agents.
