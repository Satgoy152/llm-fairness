Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  94  99   5  79
1  10  22  29  99  44
2  23  74  84  79  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 and 2 with values 94 and 99 respectively.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 with a value of 99.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 and 1 with values 84 and 74 respectively, but item 2 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 4:

4. **Remaining items 0 and 4**:
   - Item 0: Lowest value overall, highest value to Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Highest value to Agent 0.

To balance allocations and considering the remaining values:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has only one item and item 0 has a low but still positive value to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it has a relatively high value for them.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and respects the relative valuations of the agents as much as possible.
