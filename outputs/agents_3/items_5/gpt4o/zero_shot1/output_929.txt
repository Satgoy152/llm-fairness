Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  69   8  34  75
1  75  13  96  52  69
2  96  56  36  67  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we could use the following strategy: each agent should receive items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that every item is allocated once. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives approximately the same number of items, given that there are 3 agents and 5 items.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (88), Item 4 (75)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (67), Item 1 (56)

Based on this analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0, Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1, Item 3

This allocation attempts to give each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
