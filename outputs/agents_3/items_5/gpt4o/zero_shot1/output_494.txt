Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   4  20  18  34
1  67  79  39  94  11
2  32  11  89  53  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction for all agents. A commonly used approach is the "greedy" method, where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 67, Agent 2 values it at 32
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 79, Agent 2 values it at 11
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 39, Agent 2 values it at 89
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 94, Agent 2 values it at 53
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 11, Agent 2 values it at 90

Now, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 (67)
2. Item 1: Agent 1 (79)
3. Item 2: Agent 2 (89)
4. Item 3: Agent 1 (94)
5. Item 4: Agent 2 (90)

After this allocation, each agent's items are as follows:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
