Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  75  10  54  76
1  78  19  13  80  57
2   3  77  86  33  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [78 19 13 80 57]
 [ 3 77 86 33 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the highest valuations for each item across the agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 73
  - Agent 1 values it at 78
  - Agent 2 values it at 3
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 1: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 75
  - Agent 1 values it at 19
  - Agent 2 values it at 77
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 10
  - Agent 1 values it at 13
  - Agent 2 values it at 86
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 54
  - Agent 1 values it at 80
  - Agent 2 values it at 33
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 4: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 76
  - Agent 1 values it at 57
  - Agent 2 values it at 13
  - Assign to Agent 0

Assignments:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
