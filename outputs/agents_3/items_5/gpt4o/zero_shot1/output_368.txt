Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  85  64  85  64
1  51   0  77  31  88
2   2  25  55  47  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll follow a strategy to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  85  64  85  64
1  51   0  77  31  88
2   2  25  55  47  49
```

We need to allocate 5 items to 3 agents.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Find the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Make sure no item is allocated more than once and ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations if needed to ensure all items are distributed.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for Agent 0: Item 1 (value 85)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for Agent 1: Item 4 (value 88)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for Agent 2: Item 2 (value 55)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

At this point, each agent has one item, and the following items are still unallocated: Item 0 and Item 3.

4. **Check Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0:
     - Valuations: Agent 0 (69), Agent 1 (51), Agent 2 (2)
     - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 as they value it the most.
   
   - Item 3:
     - Valuations: Agent 0 (85), Agent 1 (31), Agent 2 (47)
     - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 as they value it the most (and Agent 0 already has a high-value allocation, supporting fairness).

### Final Allocation
Now, we have distributed all 5 items:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1, 0, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Item 4.
- Agent 2 receives Item 2.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on the highest valuations.
