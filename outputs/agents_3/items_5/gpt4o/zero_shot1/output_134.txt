Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  22  31  57  57
1  93  36  46  10  15
2  35  20  73  39  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35 20 73 39 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction or valuation for their respective allocated items. We will try to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [60, 22, 31, 57, 57]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [93, 36, 46, 10, 15]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [35, 20, 73, 39, 41]

A potential way to allocate the items fairly is to follow these steps:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Continue this process while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items does not exceed 5.

**Allocation:**

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation of any item: 93 for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has the next highest valuation: 73 for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation: 60 for item 0, but it's already allocated, so next is 57 for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 0 also values item 4 at 57. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, Agent 1 values item 1 at 36, which is the next highest remaining. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 4].
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1].
- Agent 2 receives item [2].

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
