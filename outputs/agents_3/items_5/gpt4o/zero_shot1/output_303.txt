Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  61  89  16  77
1  48  41  57  35  20
2  19  61  65  98  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute them in a way that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are only 5 items, each agent will receive at least one item, with one agent potentially receiving two items.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [38, 61, 89, 16, 77]
Agent 1: [48, 41, 57, 35, 20]
Agent 2: [19, 61, 65, 98, 36]
```

We can start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

1. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 2, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 0, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0** is valued higher by Agent 1 than by the others, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 4** is valued higher by Agent 0 than by the others, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1** is valued equally by Agent 0 and Agent 2, but Agent 2 has received only one item so far, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and maximizes the overall satisfaction.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
