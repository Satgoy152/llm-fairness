Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  75  38  22  80
1  76  70  17  66  62
2  63   5  99  36  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent first**:
   - Agent 0: The highest value is 80 for item 4.
   - Agent 1: The highest value is 76 for item 0.
   - Agent 2: The highest value is 99 for item 2.

2. **Allocate remaining items to maximize the total value**:
   - The remaining items are 1 and 3.
   - Item 1: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 75.
     - Agent 1 values it at 70.
     - Agent 2 values it at 5.
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value).
   - Item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 22.
     - Agent 1 values it at 66.
     - Agent 2 values it at 36.
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total value is maximized. Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
