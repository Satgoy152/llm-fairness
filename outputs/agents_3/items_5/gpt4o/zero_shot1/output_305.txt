Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  82   4  62  72
1  70  13  71   8  56
2  83  79  34   9  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to distribute items such that each agent gets a similar overall value, considering their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (82), Item 4 (72), Item 3 (62)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (71), Item 0 (70), Item 4 (56)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (83), Item 1 (79), Item 4 (57)

Now, we will distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring fairness:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0)
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (remaining item and better value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 2)

Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their individual valuations as fairly as possible given the constraints.
