Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  67  96  34  36
1  75   7  52  22   0
2  42   6  38  22  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [75  7 52 22  0]
 [42  6 38 22 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are assigned. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 2: Valuation of 96.
   - Item 0: Valuation of 84.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3: Valuation of 22.
   - Item 4: Valuation of 0 (lowest value but ensures fair allocation).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1: Valuation of 6.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 5 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets at least one item.
