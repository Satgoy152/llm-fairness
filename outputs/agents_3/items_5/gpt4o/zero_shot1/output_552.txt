Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  74  75   4  38
1  24  37  72  54  25
2  17  17  72   1  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value perceived by each agent. One way to achieve this is by using a "maximum sum allocation," which assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [77, 74, 75, 4, 38]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [24, 37, 72, 54, 25]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [17, 17, 72, 1, 26]

An efficient way to allocate items is to give each item to the agent who values it the most. 

1. Item 0 has the highest value from agent 0: 77
2. Item 1 has the highest value from agent 0: 74
3. Item 2 is valued equally by agents 1 and 2, but since agent 1 has no items yet and values it quite highly (72), we assign it to agent 1.
4. Item 3 has the highest value from agent 1: 54
5. Item 4 has the highest value from agent 2: 26

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
