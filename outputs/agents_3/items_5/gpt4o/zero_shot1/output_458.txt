Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  65  21  56  29
1   4  23  50  15  77
2  26  75  23  63  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [26 75 23 63 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or valuation) of each agent given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (65).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (77).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (75), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest valuation is for item 3 (63).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have items 0 and 2 left to allocate:

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 0:
     - Agent 0 has a valuation of 44.
     - Agent 1 has a valuation of 4.
     - Agent 2 has a valuation of 26.
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation among available agents.

5. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 has a valuation of 21.
   - Agent 1 has a valuation of 50.
   - Agent 2 has a valuation of 23.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as they have the highest valuation among available agents.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
