Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  89  78  38  53
1  98  29  58  70  89
2   8  22  88   6  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the agents' valuations. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [77, 89, 78, 38, 53]
- Agent 1 values: [98, 29, 58, 70, 89]
- Agent 2 values: [8, 22, 88, 6, 42]

A potential approach is to allocate items such that we maximize the total valuation for all agents, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it the highest (89).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the highest (98).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 values it the highest (88).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for it (89).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for it (38).

This allocation ensures all items are assigned and each agent gets at least one item.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
