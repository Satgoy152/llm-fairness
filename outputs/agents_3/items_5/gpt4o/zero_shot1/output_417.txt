Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  68  59  94  22
1  90  38  35  12  34
2   6  26  50  10  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the valuations provided, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. This involves examining the values each agent assigns to the items and attempting to distribute the items such that overall satisfaction is maximized.

Here are the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [7, 68, 59, 94, 22]
- Agent 1 values: [90, 38, 35, 12, 34]
- Agent 2 values: [6, 26, 50, 10, 89]

Let's allocate the items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0: 7
   - Agent 1: 90 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 6
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. Item 1: 
   - Agent 0: 68 (highest)
   - Agent 1: 38
   - Agent 2: 26
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. Item 2: 
   - Agent 0: 59
   - Agent 1: 35
   - Agent 2: 50
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. Item 3: 
   - Agent 0: 94 (highest)
   - Agent 1: 12
   - Agent 2: 10
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. Item 4: 
   - Agent 0: 22
   - Agent 1: 34
   - Agent 2: 89 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives the items they value the most.
