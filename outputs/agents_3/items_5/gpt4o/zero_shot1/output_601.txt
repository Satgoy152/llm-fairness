Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  35  28  77  93
1  65  61  85  67  24
2  72  90  92  54  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [72 90 92 54 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 90, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the second highest at 92, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.

2. **Next Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 93, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the second highest at 77, so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
   
3. **Remaining Item:**
   - Item 0 is left. 
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest among the remaining options at 65, so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is relatively maximized. 

Now, presenting the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
