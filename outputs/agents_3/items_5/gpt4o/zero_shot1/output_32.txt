Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  56  52  72  37
1  15  22  42  14  33
2   8  43  76  64  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each item by each agent. We aim to maximize the total satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values are [70, 56, 52, 72, 37]
- Agent 1: Values are [15, 22, 42, 14, 33]
- Agent 2: Values are [8, 43, 76, 64, 37]

To allocate fairly, we'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 70.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 56.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 76.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 33.

Now, let's check the distribution:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation maximizes the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
