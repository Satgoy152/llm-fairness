Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  54  65  61  73
1  72  42  68  30  16
2  74  32   3   6  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the goal of maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value available. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Evaluate the Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 95 + 54 + 65 + 61 + 73 = 348
   - Agent 1: 72 + 42 + 68 + 30 + 16 = 228
   - Agent 2: 74 + 32 + 3 + 6 + 21 = 136

2. **Allocate Items Based on Value Priorities:**
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (95), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (54), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Valued highest by Agent 1 (68), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (61), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Valued highest by Agent 0 (73), allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 four items and Agent 1 one item. Agent 2 unfortunately does not receive any items under this allocation as they hold the lowest valuations.

Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation is based on maximizing the individual value each agent receives while distributing all items.
