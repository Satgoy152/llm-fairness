Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  47  83  40  66
1  82  72  55  34  57
2  55  31  97  69  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We aim for an allocation where the combined valuation across all agents is as high as possible.

Let's examine the valuations of each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [13, 47, 83, 40, 66]
- Agent 1: [82, 72, 55, 34, 57]
- Agent 2: [55, 31, 97, 69, 68]

We should aim to maximize the total value by assigning items to agents who value them the most. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 2 (highest value: 97).
2. **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 1 (highest value: 82).
3. **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 1 (second highest value: 72).
4. **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 0 (highest value: 66).
5. **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 2 (second highest value: 69).

Checking the allocations:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

This allocation gives us a total valuation of:
- Agent 0: 66 (Item 4)
- Agent 1: 154 (Items 0 and 1)
- Agent 2: 166 (Items 2 and 3)

This results in a high total valuation across all agents while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
