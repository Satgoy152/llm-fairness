Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  60  83  19  12
1  79  31  81  74   4
2  84  60  49  45  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [84 60 49 45 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their relative valuations. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [82, 60, 83, 19, 12]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [79, 31, 81, 74, 4]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [84, 60, 49, 45, 22]

Let's assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (84)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (60) or Agent 2 (60)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (83)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (74)
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (22)

This initial allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 4

Now, let's verify and ensure fairness:
- Agent 0 has 1 item: [2]
- Agent 1 has 1 item: [3]
- Agent 2 has 3 items: [0, 1, 4]

Since Agent 2 has more items, we can try to balance the allocation by looking at other valuations:

Reevaluate item 1, as it has the same valuation for Agents 0 and 2. Assign it to Agent 0 to balance the allocation more fairly.

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 1 item
- Agent 2: 2 items

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This provides a more balanced distribution of items among the agents.
