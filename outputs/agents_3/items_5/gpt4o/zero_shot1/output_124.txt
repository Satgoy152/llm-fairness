Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  16  79  96   2
1  39  51  18  53  57
2  62  51  50  68  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 80.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 51 (tied with Agent 2, but as Agent 1 has fewer high-value items, we'll assign it to Agent 1).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 57.

2. Ensure each agent gets a fair share of items:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 for balance.

Allocations based on this approach:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
