Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43   3  28  17  98
1  49  59  38  94  92
2  78   6  21  83  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One common approach to this problem is to use the "maximum sum allocation" strategy, which seeks to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) across all agents.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high value for item 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 3 and 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high value for item 0.

A possible allocation strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation could be:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 since they value it the most.
- Assign items 3 and 1 to Agent 1 since they have high values for these items.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since they value it the most.
- Item 2 can be assigned to Agent 0 as a secondary option given the remaining items.

Therefore, the allocations could be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
