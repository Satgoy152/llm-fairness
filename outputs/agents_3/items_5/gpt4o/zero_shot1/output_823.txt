Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  25  13  54  25
1  99  30  54  97  77
2  90  21  28  86  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we will consider the valuations provided in the table and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 25
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 54
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 97
  - Item 4: 77

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 4: 66

A fair approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the agents' total satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 is given item 3 (value 54).
   - Agent 1 is given item 0 (value 99).
   - Agent 2 is given item 4 (value 66).

2. Allocate remaining items to maximize total value while ensuring no agent receives more than two items:
   - Item 1: Agent 1 has a valuation of 30, Agent 0 has a valuation of 25, and Agent 2 has a valuation of 21. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 has a valuation of 54, Agent 0 has a valuation of 13, and Agent 2 has a valuation of 28. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 2: [4]

This distribution ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
