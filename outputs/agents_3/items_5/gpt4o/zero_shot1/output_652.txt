Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  29  39  74  86
1  46  36  70  61  30
2  62  43  82  86  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 46, Agent 2 at 62. 
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 at 36, Agent 2 at 43.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 70, Agent 2 at 82.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 61, Agent 2 at 86.
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 30, Agent 2 at 20.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

Now, each agent should have at least one item and the items are fairly allocated based on valuations. However, we need to ensure all agents are included, and we try to balance the allocation if possible. Since Agent 2 has all items except one, we can adjust to give each agent at least one item.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4
- Agent 1: Items 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
