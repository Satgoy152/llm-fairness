Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  43  37  67  35
1  51  70  49  83  79
2  48  26  98  68  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 3 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 1 item, and the other two will receive 2 items each.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Total Valuation |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 0     | 19     | 43     | 37     | 67     | 35     | 201             |
| 1     | 51     | 70     | 49     | 83     | 79     | 332             |
| 2     | 48     | 26     | 98     | 68     | 86     | 326             |

A fair allocation strategy is to give each agent items that maximize their valuation within the constraint of total items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Given their relatively lower total valuation, we'll allocate them fewer items but ensure the allocation is still valuable to them.
2. Agent 1: We'll allocate them high-value items to maximize fairness.
3. Agent 2: We'll allocate them high-value items to maximize fairness.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Items 3 (value 67) and 1 (value 43), total value: 110.
- Agent 1: Items 4 (value 79) and 0 (value 51), total value: 130.
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 98), total value: 98.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
