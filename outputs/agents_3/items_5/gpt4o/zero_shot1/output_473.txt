Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  22  84  64  37
1  57  44  14  15  82
2   4  82  91  72  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction by ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, by considering the next highest valuation if an agent has already received an item.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 57, which is the highest. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 82, which is the highest. Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 91, which is the highest. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 64, which is the highest. Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 94, which is the highest. Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now agent 0 has 1 item, agent 1 has 1 item, and agent 2 has 3 items. All items have been allocated fairly based on valuation.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
