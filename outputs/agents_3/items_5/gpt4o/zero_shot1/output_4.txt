Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68   1  92   6   8
1  44  79  84  73  83
2  46   8  43  83  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 79 84 73 83]
 [46  8 43 83 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [68, 1, 92, 6, 8]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [44, 79, 84, 73, 83]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [46, 8, 43, 83, 35]

A potential allocation strategy involves assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0: 92
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1: 79
3. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2: 83
4. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1: 83
5. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 0: 68

Using this strategy, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

In JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
