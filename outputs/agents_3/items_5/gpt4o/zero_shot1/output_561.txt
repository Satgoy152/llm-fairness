Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  82  60  29   0
1  67   9   8  66  16
2  91  27  68  86  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the agents' valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value obtained by all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can approach this problem by considering each agent's preferences and trying to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 11 | 82 | 60 | 29 | 0  |
| 1          | 67 | 9  | 8  | 66 | 16 |
| 2          | 91 | 27 | 68 | 86 | 64 |

Given these valuations, let's distribute the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 91. Assign to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 82. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it highest at 68. Assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it highest at 86. Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it highest at 64. Assign to Agent 2.

After allocating based on the highest values, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 3, 4

While this allocation seems optimal based on maximizing the value, we should ensure fairness by potentially redistributing some items if needed. However, the initial allocation already assigns the items to the agents who value them the most, thus maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
