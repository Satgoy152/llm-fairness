Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  31   1  53  43
1  40  68  23  61  24
2  43  96   6  62  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (82), 3 (53), 4 (43)
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (68), 3 (61), 0 (40)
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (96), 4 (60), 3 (62)
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining items:**
   - Items 2 and 3 need to be allocated.

5. **Back to Agent 0:**
   - Remaining preferred items: 3 (53), 4 (43)
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

6. **Back to Agent 1:**
   - Remaining preferred item: 2 (23)
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
