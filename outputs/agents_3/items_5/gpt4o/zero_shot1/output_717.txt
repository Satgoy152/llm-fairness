Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  21  95  34  22
1  41  13   9  27  23
2  79  96  63  85  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's try to distribute the items such that the total perceived value by each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 79. We allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 96. We allocate item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 95. We allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 85. However, agent 0 is the next highest at 34. To balance allocations, we give item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 22, while agent 1 values it at 23, which is higher. We allocate item 4 to agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations to ensure each agent has items and that the total number of items allocated is 5:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]

This allocation gives us:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, distributing the total value of items fairly based on the given preferences.
