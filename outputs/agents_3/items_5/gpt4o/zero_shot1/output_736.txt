Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  61  72  59  25
1  16  78  65  25  62
2  93  52  70  59  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent. One approach is to assign items in such a way that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the most at 93.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the most at 78.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the most at 72.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because it would balance the values better for agent 0, who values it at 59.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it at 72, which is higher than the other agents.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also trying to balance the total value among the agents.
