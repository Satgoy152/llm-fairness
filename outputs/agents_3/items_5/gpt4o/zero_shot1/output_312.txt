Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41   1  48  68  16
1  88  41  18  72  31
2  27  23  32  77  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. One way to approach this is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (48), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (88), so we assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (77), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 3 next highest (68), but since item 3 is already assigned, we move to Agent 0's next highest, which is item 0, which is also assigned. We continue this process until we find item 4 (16) for Agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 3 next highest (72), but since item 3 is already assigned, we move to Agent 1's next highest, which is item 4 (31), but since item 4 is assigned, we continue until item 1 (41) is unassigned.
6. Agent 2 is left with item 1 (23), which is unassigned.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.
