Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  25  83  21  87
1  95  86  62  54  48
2  15  55  61  23  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for item 2 and moderate valuations for item 1.

We want to assign the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction (total value) for each agent while ensuring fairness. Let's try to balance the maximum possible value each agent can achieve.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 4 with values 83 and 87, total value = 170.
- Agent 1: Item 0 with value 95, total value = 95.
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 3 with values 55 and 23, total value = 78.

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items distributed is 5.
