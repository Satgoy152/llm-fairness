Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  61  77  85  76
1  50   7  86  19  22
2   2  10   1  58  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2 10  1 58 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and only 5 items are allocated in total. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** 6, 61, 77, 85, 76
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** 50, 7, 86, 19, 22
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** 2, 10, 1, 58, 21

To achieve a fair allocation, we should prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most. Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 1 at 86.
- **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 0 at 85.
- **Item 4** is valued more by Agent 0 at 76 than others.
- **Item 0** is valued more by Agent 1 at 50.
- **Item 1** is valued more by Agent 0 at 61.

Now let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 2**: No items allocated

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed according to the highest valuations for each agent while respecting the constraint of allocating exactly 5 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
