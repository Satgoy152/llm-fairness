Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  18  18  29  94
1  16  82  41   1  74
2  26  99  53  73  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a balanced distribution. One common approach is to try maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. However, given there are 5 items and 3 agents, not every agent can receive an item if we want to maintain balance strictly by items rather than by value. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
4. Items 0 and 2 are remaining, and Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 0, while Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 2.

Considering these observations, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations within a fair distribution framework.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
