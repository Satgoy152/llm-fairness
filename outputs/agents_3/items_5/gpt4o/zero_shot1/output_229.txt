Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  56  51  13  79
1  32  48  65  62  74
2  57  64  43  36  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Our goal is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the following valuations:

```
Agent 0:
- Item 0: 34
- Item 1: 56
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 13
- Item 4: 79

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 32
- Item 1: 48
- Item 2: 65
- Item 3: 62
- Item 4: 74

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 64
- Item 2: 43
- Item 3: 36
- Item 4: 97
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 4 is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 97).
2. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1 (value of 62).
3. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 (value of 65).
4. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 64).
5. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 57).

To ensure that each agent gets a fair allocation, we need to adjust some allocations. Letâ€™s balance the distribution across agents:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

After reviewing the allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
