Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  89  39  92  58
1  62  52  78  89  80
2  34   2  15  79  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [0, 89, 39, 92, 58]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 1 (89)
   - Allocation: Items 3 and 1

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [62, 52, 78, 89, 80]
   - Highest remaining valuation: Item 4 (80)
   - Allocation: Item 4

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: [34, 2, 15, 79, 41]
   - Highest remaining valuations: Item 0 (34), Item 2 (15)
   - Allocation: Items 0 and 2

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives the highest possible valuation given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
