Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  28  88  56  55
1  24  72  64  51  11
2   2  67  12  65  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 2 67 12 65 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here are the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all items:
- Agent 0: 79 + 28 + 88 + 56 + 55 = 306
- Agent 1: 24 + 72 + 64 + 51 + 11 = 222
- Agent 2: 2 + 67 + 12 + 65 + 19 = 165

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (88) and item 0 (79). Allocating these two items to agent 0 provides significant satisfaction.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (72) and item 2 (64). However, since item 2 is already allocated to agent 0, we can allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (65) and item 1 (67). Since item 1 is allocated to agent 1, allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. The remaining items are 4 and 3. Allocate item 4 to agent 1 and item 3 to agent 2.

After this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 4].
- Agent 2 gets item [3].

Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
