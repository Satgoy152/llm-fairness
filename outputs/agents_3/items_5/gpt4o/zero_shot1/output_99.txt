Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  55   3  69  43
1  10   2   7  12  38
2  73   6  31  58  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: High values for items 0, 1, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Only significant value is for item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0, 3, and 4.

Considering these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, and 2

This way, each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
