Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  74  47  21  14
1  36   5   4  89  64
2  95   7  71  23  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[40 74 47 21 14]
 [36  5  4 89 64]
 [95  7 71 23 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [40, 74, 47, 21, 14]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [36, 5, 4, 89, 64]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [95, 7, 71, 23, 19]

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 74.
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 71.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 89.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it at 64, which is the highest available option after considering other allocations.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets Items 0 and 2.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
