Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  57  65  27  97
1  81  47  26   2  67
2  30  51  24  71  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum" allocation, where items are assigned to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item among the agents:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 81.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 57.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 65.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 71.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.

2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:**
   - Item 0 to Agent 1
   - Item 1 to Agent 0
   - Item 2 to Agent 0
   - Item 3 to Agent 2
   - Item 4 to Agent 0

3. **Ensure fairness by adjusting allocations if necessary to maintain a balance:**
   - Agent 0 initially has items 1, 2, and 4.
   - Agent 1 has item 0.
   - Agent 2 has item 3.

   To ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can adjust the allocations:
   - Move item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 for a more balanced allocation.

4. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 2 receives item 3.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
