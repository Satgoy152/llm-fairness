Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  66  50  66  22
1  15  12  60  37  76
2  59  59  42  92  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy that considers the given valuations:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Values: [32, 66, 50, 66, 22]
   - High values: Items 1 and 3 (both valued at 66)

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [15, 12, 60, 37, 76]
   - High value: Item 4 (valued at 76)

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [59, 59, 42, 92, 69]
   - High value: Item 3 (valued at 92), but already assigned to Agent 0
   - Next high values: Items 0 and 4 (valued at 59 and 69 respectively)

Given these considerations, here's a fair allocation:

- Assign Items 1 and 3 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 2

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to distribute the values fairly.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
