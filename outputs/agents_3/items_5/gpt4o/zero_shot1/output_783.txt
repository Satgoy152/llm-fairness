Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  16  10  93  51
1  40  15  25  79  82
2  85  69  67  35  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents by considering their valuations. We will assign items to agents such that each agent receives at least one item, and no item is assigned more than once. 

Let's find an allocation that seems fair:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for item 3 (93).
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for item 4 (82).
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 0 (85).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

4. **Remaining items 1 and 2**:
   - For item 1:
     - Agent 2 values item 1 higher (69) than Agent 0 (16) and Agent 1 (15). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - For item 2:
     - Agent 2 values item 2 (67) higher than Agent 0 (10) and Agent 1 (25). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

Agent 0 receives item 3, Agent 1 receives item 4, and Agent 2 receives items 0, 1, and 2. This allocation takes into account the agents' highest preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
