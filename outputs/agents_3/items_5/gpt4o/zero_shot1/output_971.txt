Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  16  82  82  39
1  85  45  45  33  30
2   6   5  75  26  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6  5 75 26 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly five. Let's evaluate the best allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Values: [4, 16, 82, 82, 39]
  - High-value items: 2 and 3 (82)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Values: [85, 45, 45, 33, 30]
  - High-value item: 0 (85)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Values: [6, 5, 75, 26, 37]
  - High-value item: 2 (75)

A possible allocation strategy is:
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it the most (82) and also assign item 3 to Agent 0 as it has the same value (82).
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 2, as they have moderate values and Agent 2 doesn't have a high-value item left.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, maximizing overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
