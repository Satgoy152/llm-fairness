Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15   5  44  76  57
1  72  83  45  25  63
2  77  41  32   9  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will attempt to distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is maximized while ensuring that every item is allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valued Items for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 3 (76) and 4 (57).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 1 (83) and 4 (63).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 0 (77) and 4 (85).

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximizing Total Valuation:**

   We will try to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each item is allocated once:

   - **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the most (77).
   - **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most (83).
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most (44).
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it the most (76).
   - **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most (85).

3. **Resulting Allocations:**

   Based on the above, the allocations are:

   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.

4. **JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items while maximizing each agent's total satisfaction based on their valuations.
