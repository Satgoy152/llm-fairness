Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  88   3  26  35
1  21  97  81  29  30
2  92  53  92  45  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has relatively low valuations for most items except item 1. However, item 1 has a higher valuation for Agent 1, so we'll consider other options for Agent 0.
   - Can reasonably be assigned item 3 (valuation of 26) and item 4 (valuation of 35).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has the highest valuation for item 1 (97) and a high valuation for item 2 (81).
   - Assign item 1 and item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has high valuations for item 0 (92) and item 2 (92).
   - However, since item 2 is already assigned to Agent 1, assign item 0 to Agent 2.

By following this allocation strategy, we ensure that all items are allocated while attempting to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
