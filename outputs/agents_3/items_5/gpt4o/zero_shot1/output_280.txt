Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5   8   1  96  86
1  95  99  43  35  32
2  52  44  44  70  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [5, 8, 1, 96, 86]
- Agent 1: [95, 99, 43, 35, 32]
- Agent 2: [52, 44, 44, 70, 33]

A strategy to achieve a fair allocation is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly. We can try to allocate the highest-valued item for each agent first, and then distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall value for each agent.

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (96), so we can allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly (99), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly, but since it's already taken by Agent 0, we allocate the next highest available item, which is item 0 (52), to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 3, 1, and 0. The remaining items are 2 and 4.

4. Agent 1 values item 2 (43) reasonably, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 0 values item 4 (86) more than Agent 2 does, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

The allocation then becomes:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
