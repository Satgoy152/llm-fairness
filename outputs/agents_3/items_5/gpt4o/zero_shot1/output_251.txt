Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  58  14  23  88
1  86  53  27  30  73
2  73  68  59  33  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider different combinations to find a balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0, but it's slightly lower than Agent 0's valuation for the same item. However, Agent 1 values item 4 highly as well.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation for items 1 and 2.

A possible allocation strategy is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

This allocation allows each agent to receive items that they value, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
