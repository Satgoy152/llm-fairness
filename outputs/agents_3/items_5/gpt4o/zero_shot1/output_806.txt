Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  88  99   2  75
1  61  49  72  54  11
2   7  14  69  32   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 14 69 32  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced, considering their valuations. Let's analyze the table of values:

```
Agent 0: [18, 88, 99, 2, 75]
Agent 1: [61, 49, 72, 54, 11]
Agent 2: [7, 14, 69, 32, 8]
```

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high valuation only for item 2.

A possible fair distribution could be:

- Give **Agent 0** item 1 and item 4.
- Give **Agent 1** item 0 and item 3.
- Give **Agent 2** item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, considering their preferences, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
