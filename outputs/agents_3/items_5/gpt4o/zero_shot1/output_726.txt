Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  75  54  85  97
1  41  93  48  90  31
2  20  34  98  84   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will start by examining the values each agent places on each item and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes satisfaction for all agents.

Let's look at the highest values each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (97), followed by item 3 (85).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (93), followed by item 3 (90).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (98), followed by item 3 (84).

A potential allocation strategy is to try and give each agent their most valued item, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Give item 4 to Agent 0 (since 97 is the highest value among all).
2. Give item 1 to Agent 1 (93 is the highest for Agent 1).
3. Give item 2 to Agent 2 (98 is the highest for Agent 2).
4. Now, for item 3, Agent 0 and Agent 1 are close in valuation (85 vs. 90), but since Agent 1 has already received item 1, we can give item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, item 0 has the highest value for Agent 0 (69), but since Agent 0 already has two items, we'll give it to Agent 1 (41), as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2 does.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
