Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  17  84  80  96
1  11  19  18  49  70
2  55  83  84  86  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46 17 84 80 96]
 [11 19 18 49 70]
 [55 83 84 86 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A possible allocation strategy is to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair chance at receiving items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [46, 17, 84, 80, 96]
- Agent 1: [11, 19, 18, 49, 70]
- Agent 2: [55, 83, 84, 86, 35]

We aim to allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 4 (96).
2. Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 4 (70), but since item 4 is taken, we consider item 3 (49).
3. Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 3 (86), but since item 3 is taken, we consider item 2 (84).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 0 (46) as it's the second highest for this agent.
- Agent 2 can take item 1 (83) as it is the next highest available item for this agent.

The allocation can be summarized as:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
