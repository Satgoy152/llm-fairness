Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  12  12  14   5
1  26  20  65  23  28
2  49  92  75  51  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. This approach will try to ensure that each agent gets items that are most valuable to them, which can often lead to a more equitable distribution in terms of satisfaction.

Let's examine the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 14
  - Item 4: 5

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 65
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 28

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 83

To allocate the items fairly, let's proceed as follows:

1. **Assign Item 0:** It is most valuable to Agent 0, but Agent 2 also values it highly. To balance allocations, assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Assign Item 1:** It is most valuable to Agent 2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Assign Item 2:** It is most valuable to Agent 1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Assign Item 3:** It is most valuable to Agent 2, but since Agent 2 already has two items, we will try to give this to another agent who also values it. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Assign Item 4:** It is most valuable to Agent 2, but we want to distribute items more evenly. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's look at the final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution considers the valuation preferences to provide a fair allocation.
