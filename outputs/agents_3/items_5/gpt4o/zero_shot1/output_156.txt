Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68   6  62  74  38
1  47  49  95  41  35
2  49  20  52  47  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We will proceed by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's start by examining the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [68, 6, 62, 74, 38]
Agent 1: [47, 49, 95, 41, 35]
Agent 2: [49, 20, 52, 47, 19]
```

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 47
   - Agent 2 values it at 49
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 95
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 74
   - Agent 1 values it at 41
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2
- Agent 2 gets no items

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
