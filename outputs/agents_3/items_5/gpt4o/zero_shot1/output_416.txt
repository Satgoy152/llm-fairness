Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  70  22  57  38
1  36  95  66  12  38
2  76  98  72  41  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 71.
   - Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Agent 2 values it at 76.  
   - **Assign to Agent 2.**

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 70.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Agent 2 values it at 98.  
   - **Assign to Agent 2.**

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 22.
   - Agent 1 values it at 66.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.  
   - **Assign to Agent 2.**

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Agent 2 values it at 41.  
   - **Assign to Agent 0.**

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 38.
   - Agent 1 values it at 38.
   - Agent 2 values it at 48.  
   - **Assign to Agent 2.**

Now let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2, 4

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
