Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  60   8  63  78
1  31  74  91  98  91
2   8  50  65  60  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 74 91 98 91]
 [ 8 50 65 60 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent valuations:
0: [10, 60, 8, 63, 78]
1: [31, 74, 91, 98, 91]
2: [8, 50, 65, 60, 79]
```

First, let's evaluate which items are most valued by each agent and try to allocate them accordingly:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (78) and item 3 (63).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (98) and item 2 (91).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (65) and item 4 (79).

A potential fair allocation could be:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (98).
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it the most (79).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the most (60) among the remaining items.
4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they have a high interest in it (91) and it's their second choice after item 3.
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it provides them with some value (10) and is their remaining choice.

This allocation aims to maximize the total satisfaction and ensure all items are fairly distributed based on preferences.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
