Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  62  57  33  67
1  84  76  41  61   7
2  61  27  45  56  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we will try to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, possibly maximizing the total valuation across all agents. Hereâ€™s one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: 28, 62, 57, 33, 67
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (67)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: 84, 76, 41, 61, 7
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (84)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: 61, 27, 45, 56, 13
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (61), but it is already allocated to Agent 1, so next best is Item 3 (56)

Given this, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 4 (highest available valuation for items not already allocated)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (highest valuation overall)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (next highest available valuation)

Now, allocate the remaining item:

- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (next highest available valuation for Agent 2)

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets an allocation based on their preferences as much as possible.
