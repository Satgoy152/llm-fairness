Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  87  74  80  51
1  23  88  22  89  35
2   3  97  24  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to ensure that each agent receives the items they value most, within the constraint that each agent can only receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.

Let's approach this problem by evaluating which agent values each item the most, and then check if the allocations are fair and complete.

### Valuation Analysis:
1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 23
   - Agent 2 values it at 3

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 97 (highest)
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 88

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 74 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 24

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest)
   - Agent 0 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 45

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 51 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Agent 2 values it at 10

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 4 (highest valuation for these items)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (highest valuation for this item)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (highest valuation for this item)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation adheres to the constraints and is based on maximizing individual agent valuations for each item.
