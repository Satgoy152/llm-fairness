Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  73   8  17  27
1  94  44  58  15  56
2  27  48  37  28  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that considers the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 94
   - Agent 2 values it at 27
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 73
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 37
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 17
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 has 1 item (Item 1).
- Agent 1 has 3 items (Items 0, 2, 4).
- Agent 2 has 1 item (Item 3).

This allocation is fair based on the highest valuation per item while ensuring that all agents receive at least one item if possible.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
