Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  29  43  38  40
1  43   9  20  83  87
2  56  58  41  50  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [56 58 41 50 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. One approach is to use a simple heuristic like the following:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  29  43  38  40
1  43   9  20  83  87
2  56  58  41  50  56
```

Let's determine the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88 (highest), so it goes to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values it at 58 (highest), so it goes to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 43 (highest), so it goes to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 83 (highest), so it goes to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 87 (highest), so it goes to Agent 1.

Now, each agent is assigned items based on their highest preference for those items. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

Each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total allocation sums up to 5 items as required.
