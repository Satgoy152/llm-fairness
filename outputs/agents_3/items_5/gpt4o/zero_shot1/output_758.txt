Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  43  37  83  86
1  45  28  10  57  40
2  78  42   4  52  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most compared to other items, but not as much as Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4, even higher than Agent 0.

We will try to allocate items based on these observations:

- **Item 4** should be allocated to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (94).
- **Item 3** should go to Agent 0, as they have a higher valuation for it (83) than Agent 1 (57).
- **Item 0** should go to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (65).
- **Item 1** should be allocated to Agent 0 as well, maximizing their total valuation.
- **Item 2** should be allocated to Agent 1 since Agent 0 and 2 have a low valuation for it.

With these allocations in mind, here's the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
