Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  86  21  18  48
1  38  76  99  22  56
2  56  55  22   2   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 5 items are allocated. We will consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We can allocate items that agent 0 values the most. The highest values are for items 1 (86) and 4 (48).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the highest (99), followed by item 1 (76) and item 4 (56). However, item 1 is already allocated to agent 0, so we can allocate item 2 and item 3 (22) to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 can be allocated item 0 (56) as it is the highest valued remaining item for this agent.

Given these considerations, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
