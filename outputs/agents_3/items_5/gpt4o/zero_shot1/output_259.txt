Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  97  94  72  50
1  23  68  81  92  62
2  43  73  48  86  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [43 73 48 86 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a method that involves assigning items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  97  94  72  50
1  23  68  81  92  62
2  43  73  48  86  75
```

We will follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets items through a balanced approach to allocation.

Starting with the highest valuations for each item:
- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 43.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 97.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 92.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 75.

By assigning these items based on the highest valuation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the overall valuation.
