Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  21  56  37  42
1  83  48   9  52  51
2  20   7  76  68  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the valuation each agent receives from the items assigned to them. One approach is to assign items based on the maximum value each agent has for the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the item that each agent values the most, ensuring that at least one item is assigned to each agent.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's calculate:

- Agent 0 values: [51, 21, 56, 37, 42]
- Agent 1 values: [83, 48, 9, 52, 51]
- Agent 2 values: [20, 7, 76, 68, 82]

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (value = 56)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value = 83)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (value = 82)

2. Remaining items: [1, 3]
   - Distribute remaining items to maximize total valuation:
     - Agent 0: Item 3 (value = 37)
     - Agent 2: Item 1 (value = 7)

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
