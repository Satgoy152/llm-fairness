Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  44  53  88  90
1  97  37  99  55   1
2  68   0  22  38   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item whenever possible.

Let's review the valuations and make a decision:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 1
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 88
- Item 4: 90

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 97
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 99
- Item 3: 55
- Item 4: 1

Agent 2's valuations:
- Item 0: 68
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 22
- Item 3: 38
- Item 4: 8

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0 should go to Agent 1 (97 is the highest value)
2. Item 1 should go to Agent 0 (44 is the highest value)
3. Item 2 should go to Agent 1 (99 is the highest value)
4. Item 3 should go to Agent 0 (88 is the highest value)
5. Item 4 should go to Agent 0 (90 is the highest value)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 2: No items (since their highest valued item still wasn't the highest overall)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
