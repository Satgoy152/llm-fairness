Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  65  86  52  15
1  78  38  39  15   3
2   3   9  34  44  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 38 39 15  3]
 [ 3  9 34 44 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [57, 65, 86, 52, 15]
- Agent 1: [78, 38, 39, 15, 3]
- Agent 2: [3, 9, 34, 44, 40]

Let's allocate items by considering the highest valuations first while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 0 (86).
2. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 1 (78).
3. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 2 (44).

Now, we have allocated items 2, 0, and 3. We still need to allocate items 1 and 4, considering the remaining highest valuations:

4. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 65, which is the highest among remaining valuations.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 40, which is the highest among remaining valuations.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
