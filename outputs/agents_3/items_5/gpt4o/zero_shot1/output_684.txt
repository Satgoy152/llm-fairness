Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  76  30  87  57
1   9  36   2  96  41
2  50  75  42  85  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [19, 76, 30, 87, 57]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 1 (76)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [9, 36, 2, 96, 41]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 4 (41)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [50, 75, 42, 85, 80]
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (75), Item 4 (80)

Based on these valuations, a balanced allocation would be:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 since they value it the most.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 since they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 as well since they also value it highly.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it's better than the remaining options.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it fits best remaining options.

After considering the valuations and ensuring each agent gets a fair share, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
