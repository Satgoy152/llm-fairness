Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  39  94  81  10
1  72  85   5  27  41
2  45  44  58  43  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [45 44 58 43 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the total allocation is fair in terms of their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [12, 39, 94, 81, 10]
- Agent 1's valuations: [72, 85, 5, 27, 41]
- Agent 2's valuations: [45, 44, 58, 43, 44]

We'll aim to allocate the items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their highest valuations, but also ensure each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (94). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (85). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (58), but itâ€™s already taken. The next highest is item 0 (45). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Remaining for Agent 0**: Next highest available is item 3 (81). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Remaining for Agent 1**: Next highest available is item 4 (41). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Each agent has now received at least one item, and all five items have been allocated.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring fairness in distribution.
