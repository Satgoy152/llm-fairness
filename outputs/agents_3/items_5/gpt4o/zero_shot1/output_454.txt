Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  74   9  84  96
1   1  57  63  10  18
2  16  23   2  53  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can achieve this by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has a moderate valuation for item 3.

To fairly allocate the items, we can consider the following allocation:

1. Assign items with the highest value to each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
2. Balance the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent.

Proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4 (valuations: 59 + 96 = 155)
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2 (valuations: 57 + 63 = 120)
- Agent 2 receives item 3 (valuation: 53)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
