Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  70  66  22  99
1  32  77  53  72  89
2  93  29  14  69  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize total satisfaction or balance the distribution based on the valuations given. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 94
   - Item 1: 70
   - Item 2: 66
   - Item 3: 22
   - Item 4: 99

2. **Agent 1** values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 32
   - Item 1: 77
   - Item 2: 53
   - Item 3: 72
   - Item 4: 89

3. **Agent 2** values items as follows:
   - Item 0: 93
   - Item 1: 29
   - Item 2: 14
   - Item 3: 69
   - Item 4: 35

Let's try to allocate the items where each agent gets the items they value most, ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

- **Agent 0** should prioritize items with the highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 0 (94)
- **Agent 1** should prioritize items with the highest values: Item 1 (77), Item 3 (72)
- **Agent 2** should prioritize items with the highest values: Item 0 (93), but since it's already taken, Item 3 (69)

Considering the above, a balanced allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 0

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
