Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  25  96   4   8
1  25   1  99  66  95
2  90  41  50  43  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [90 41 50 43 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider various methods to optimize fairness, such as maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. In this scenario, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [56, 25, 96, 4, 8]
- Agent 1: [25, 1, 99, 66, 95]
- Agent 2: [90, 41, 50, 43, 42]

We need to assign each of the 5 items to one of the agents while ensuring fairness. One potential approach is to give each agent items that they value highly, without giving one agent significantly more total value than the others.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value 99).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value 90).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value 66).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value 41).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (remaining highest value 8).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
