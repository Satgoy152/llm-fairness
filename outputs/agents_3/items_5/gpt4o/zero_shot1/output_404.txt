Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  38  76  59   3
1  70  60  87  16  11
2  16  39  82   0  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [16 39 82  0 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we will use the concept of maximizing individual agent's valuations for the items assigned to them. We'll look for a way to allocate items such that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [45, 38, 76, 59, 3]
Agent 1: [70, 60, 87, 16, 11]
Agent 2: [16, 39, 82, 0, 96]
```

Let's consider assigning the items as follows:

- Agent 0 should get the item with the highest value from their perspective, which is item 2 (value 76).
- Agent 1 should get the item with the highest value from their perspective, which is item 2 (value 87), but since item 2 is already assigned to Agent 0, we look for the next highest: item 0 (value 70).
- Agent 2 should get the item with the highest value from their perspective, which is item 4 (value 96).

Now, let's consider the remaining items after the highest values have been allocated:

- Item 1 remains, and Agent 1 values it at 60, which is the highest remaining valuation.
- Item 3 remains, and Agent 0 values it at 59, which is the highest remaining valuation.

The allocation would then be:

- Agent 0: items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: item [4]

Thus, the allocation of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
