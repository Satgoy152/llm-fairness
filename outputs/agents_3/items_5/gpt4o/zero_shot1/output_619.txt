Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  64   2  37  65
1  44  24  27  31  46
2  19  22   3  76  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item or as balanced a distribution as possible. We can use a greedy strategy to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [6, 64, 2, 37, 65]
- Agent 1 values: [44, 24, 27, 31, 46]
- Agent 2 values: [19, 22, 3, 76, 62]

To start, let's allocate the items to the agents based on the highest individual valuations:

1. Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 at 65.
2. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 at 76.
3. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 at 44.

So far, we have allocated:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 2) to balance the distribution:

4. Item 1 has higher valuations for Agent 0 and Agent 2 than Agent 1. To maintain balance and since Agent 0 already has an item, assign Item 1 to Agent 2, who has a higher valuation for it than Agent 1.
5. Finally, assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 is currently the only one with just one item and it's the least valued by Agent 0 and Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
