Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  24  24  30  86
1  50  46  15   8  15
2  48   6  64  59  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives or balance the allocations based on the highest individual valuations. Let's consider a few points to guide our allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4 (86).
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 1 (46).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4 (88) and item 2 (64).

A fair allocation could involve assigning each agent items based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are assigned. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (88).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they also have a high valuation for it (64).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (60).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high valuation for this item (46).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they have a moderate valuation for it (30), and it balances the number of items each agent receives.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value relatively highly.
