Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  33  68   3  94
1  57  83  69   7  39
2  15  41  65  74  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 83 69  7 39]
 [15 41 65 74 60]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the method of maximizing total utility or valuation for the agents. This involves assigning items to the agents such that the sum of valuations is maximized, while each agent receives at least one item.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 33, 68, 3, 94]
- Agent 1: [57, 83, 69, 7, 39]
- Agent 2: [15, 41, 65, 74, 60]

We can proceed with a simple allocation strategy, considering the highest value for each item across agents and assigning that item accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 57.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 68.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 74.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.

After assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations, here are the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Now, let's format this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
