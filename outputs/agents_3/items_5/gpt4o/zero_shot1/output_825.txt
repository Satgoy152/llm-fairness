Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  48  88  17  19
1  31  77  29  73  16
2  50  10  17  99  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations for each agent and each item, we need to distribute all 5 items among the 3 agents. 

Let's assess the valuations to make the allocations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 19

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 16

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 51

To maximize fairness and total valuation, consider the following allocations:

1. Agent 0 should receive items with the highest valuations to them. Items 2 and 1 have high valuations for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 should receive items with high valuations to them. Items 3 and 0 have high valuations for Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 should receive items with high valuations to them. Item 4 has a good valuation for Agent 2.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 0
- Agent 2: Item 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```
