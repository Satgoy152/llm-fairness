Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  34  67  83  90
1  42   4  88  87  44
2  58  50  68  23  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as there are only five items available and three agents. A possible approach is to assign items based on the highest individual valuations or to ensure that the total valuation for each agent is balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 34
- Item 2: 67
- Item 3: 83
- Item 4: 90

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 42
- Item 1: 4
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 44

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 50
- Item 2: 68
- Item 3: 23
- Item 4: 87

We should aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness. One approach is to start by assigning items with the highest value to each agent:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 90).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value: 88).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value: 58).

Now, we have two items left to allocate (Items 1 and 3), and each agent should ideally get one more item to balance the distribution:

4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 87). Agent 1 now has two items, but this ensures they get a decent total valuation.
5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 34). This gives Agent 0 a second item and balances the distribution.

Agent 2 receives only one item, but it has a higher value for them compared to other unallocated items.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
