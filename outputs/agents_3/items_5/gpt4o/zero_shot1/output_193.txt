Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  17  51  58  77
1  93  21  89  63  50
2  73  32  99  25  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method such as maximizing the total valuation across all agents. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations**: 
    - Agent 0: [44, 17, 51, 58, 77]
    - Agent 1: [93, 21, 89, 63, 50]
    - Agent 2: [73, 32, 99, 25, 51]

2. **Identify the highest valuations for each item to maximize total satisfaction**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (93)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (32)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (99)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (63)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (77)

3. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations**:
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 and item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 1 and item 2.
   - Agent 0 gets item 4.

4. **Ensure only 5 items are allocated and each item is assigned to one agent**.

5. **Present the allocations in the required JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned items in a way that maximizes their total valuation based on the given table.
