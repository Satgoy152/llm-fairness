Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  30  24  30  77
1   1  47  72  59  53
2  65  82  38  14  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 82 38 14 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  30  24  30  77
1   1  47  72  59  53
2  65  82  38  14  81
```

To achieve a fair distribution, let's consider the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (77).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (72).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (82).

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, and 4. We need to allocate items 0 and 3.

- For item 0:
  - Agent 2 values it the highest (65).
  
- For item 3:
  - Agent 1 values it the highest (59).

Thus, we can allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
