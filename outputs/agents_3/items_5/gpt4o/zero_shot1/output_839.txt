Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  58  14  71  25
1  54   6  42  66  51
2  52  92   2  12  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [52 92  2 12 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items such that their total value is maximized relative to their preferences, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. 

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (83) and 3 (71).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (66) and 4 (51).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (92) and 0 (52).

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1** receives items 4.
- **Agent 2** receives items 1 and 2.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
