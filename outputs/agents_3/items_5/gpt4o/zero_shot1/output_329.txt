Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  98  23  15  80
1  37  86  76  15  84
2  28  30  37  68  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item is 1 (value 98).
   - Second highest is 4 (value 80).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item is 2 (value 76).
   - Second highest is 4 (value 84), but item 4 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next available highest value item is 0 (value 37).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item is 3 (value 68).
   - Second highest is 2 (value 37), but item 2 is already taken by Agent 1.
   - Next available is item 4 (value 28), but item 4 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Thus, Agent 2 receives item 3.

Given these allocations, here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and that all items are allocated.
