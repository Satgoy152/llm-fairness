Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  91   6   3  72
1  51  23  42  44  85
2  80  34  29  21  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that the overall satisfaction is as high as possible based on the given valuations.

Let's evaluate each item and allocate it to the agent that values it the most:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 16
  - Agent 1 values it at 51
  - Agent 2 values it at 80
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value: 80)

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 91
  - Agent 1 values it at 23
  - Agent 2 values it at 34
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value: 91)

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 6
  - Agent 1 values it at 42
  - Agent 2 values it at 29
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 42)

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 3
  - Agent 1 values it at 44
  - Agent 2 values it at 21
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 44)

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 72
  - Agent 1 values it at 85
  - Agent 2 values it at 56
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value: 85)

With these allocations, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
