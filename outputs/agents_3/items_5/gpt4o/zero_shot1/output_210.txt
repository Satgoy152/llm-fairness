Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  54  60  14  91
1  61  53   4  37  53
2  10  85  99  41   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Let's evaluate the optimal allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items and valuations: {0: 22, 1: 54, 2: 60, 3: 14, 4: 91}
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (91)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items and valuations: {0: 61, 1: 53, 2: 4, 3: 37, 4: 53}
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (61)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items and valuations: {0: 10, 1: 85, 2: 99, 3: 41, 4: 5}
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (99)

Given that each agent should ideally receive at least one item and we need to make sure all items are allocated, we can proceed with the following allocation strategy:

- Assign the highest valued items to each agent first.

- **Agent 0** gets item 4.
- **Agent 1** gets item 0.
- **Agent 2** gets item 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3:

- Assign item 1 to **Agent 2** because it has a high valuation from them (85).
- Assign item 3 to **Agent 1** as it gives a reasonable valuation (37) and balances the allocation.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
