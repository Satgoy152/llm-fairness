Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  45  67  49   7
1  63  30  38  37  50
2  76   3  85  69  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent gets from the items they receive, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 76.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 45.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 69.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 50.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**  
   - Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, and 3.
   - Agent 0 gets item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets item 4.

3. **Check the Integer Allocation Condition:**  
   Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.

4. **Present the Allocation in the Required JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.
