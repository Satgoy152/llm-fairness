Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  61  14   8  23
1  93  11  90  15  78
2   1  60  84  47  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent considering their preferences, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a valuation of 83. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 with a valuation of 93, but since item 0 is already assigned to Agent 0, we move to the next highest value for Agent 1, which is item 2 with a valuation of 90. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 with a valuation of 84, but since item 2 is already assigned to Agent 1, we move to the next highest value for Agent 2, which is item 1 with a valuation of 60. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 3 and 4 are left. Check which agent has the highest valuation for these items.
   - For item 3, Agent 2 has the highest valuation with 47. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - For item 4, Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 78. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, we have the following assignments:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
