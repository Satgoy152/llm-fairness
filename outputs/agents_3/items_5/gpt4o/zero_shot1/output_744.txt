Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  48   9  43   2
1  50  39  52  86   9
2  99  45  25  22  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 5 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 each.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (99), Item 1 (48)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (86), Item 2 (52)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (99), Item 4 (85)

A possible allocation to maximize each agent's satisfaction and ensure fairness could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (99 is the highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (86 is the highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (85 is the highest value for Agent 2)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1)

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 2]
- Agent 2 receives item [4]

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
