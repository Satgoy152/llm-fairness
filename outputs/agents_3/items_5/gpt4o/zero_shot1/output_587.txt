Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  38  98  63  10
1  77  57  54  32  12
2  38  74  85  31  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 57 54 32 12]
 [38 74 85 31 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 22, Item 1 = 38, Item 2 = 98, Item 3 = 63, Item 4 = 10
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 77, Item 1 = 57, Item 2 = 54, Item 3 = 32, Item 4 = 12
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 38, Item 1 = 74, Item 2 = 85, Item 3 = 31, Item 4 = 95

A fair allocation could involve assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (98).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (77).
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (95).

Now for the remaining items (Item 1 and Item 3):

- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (74), so we assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest next (63), so we assign it to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
