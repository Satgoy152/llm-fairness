Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  51  59  17  90
1  64   4  16  29  59
2  75  85  98  56  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total utility or value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Check the allocations**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item. If an agent does not receive any items, reallocate to balance the distribution.

Here's the breakdown:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most (75).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most (85).
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most (98).
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (56).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most (90).

After the initial allocation, Agent 2 receives four items, and Agent 0 receives one item. Agent 1 receives no items, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

To achieve a fair allocation:
- We can reassign item 3, which Agent 1 values more than Agent 0 does but less than Agent 2. However, since Agent 2 already has the majority, this reassignment helps balance the allocation.

Here's the fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 2.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
