Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  71  55  33  18
1  64  56  64  33  62
2  66  25  35  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations of the items and try to maximize total satisfaction. A simple and reasonable approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 66.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 71.
- Item 2: Agents 0 and 1 both value it at 64. We can choose either, but let's choose Agent 0 since they might not get other high-value items.
- Item 3: Agent 0 and 1 both value it at 33. We can allocate it to Agent 1 to balance allocations.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 62.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
