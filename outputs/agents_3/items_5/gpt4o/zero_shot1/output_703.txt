Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  83  13  16  80
1  10  18  10  75  25
2  55  82   6  91  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items with reasonable total value based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 80

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 75
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 91
  - Item 4: 23

Considering these values, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 can be allocated items that they value highly: Items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 can be allocated item 3, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 can be allocated items 0 and 2.

This distribution aims to maximize individual satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
