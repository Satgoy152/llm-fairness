Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  24  23  91  99
1  76  75   6   0  72
2  28  14  22  76   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One potential approach is to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign items 0 and 4.
   - Total value: 31 (item 0) + 99 (item 4) = 130

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Assign items 1 and 2.
   - Total value: 75 (item 1) + 6 (item 2) = 81

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign item 3.
   - Total value: 76 (item 3)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.

{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
