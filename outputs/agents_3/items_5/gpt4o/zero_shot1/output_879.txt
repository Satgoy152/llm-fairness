Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  86  19  54  16
1  22  81  88  89  87
2  36  74  66  15  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value each agent assigns to items to maximize their satisfaction.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated.

After examining the table, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly at 86, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly at 89 and item 2 at 88, so allocate items 2 and 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 36 and item 4 at 35, so allocate items 0 and 4 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
