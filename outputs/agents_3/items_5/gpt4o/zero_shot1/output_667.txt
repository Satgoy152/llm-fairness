Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  28  24  86  27
1  35  82   0  78  75
2  83  71  97  69  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's consider the values:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 4: 27

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 78
  - Item 4: 75

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 69
  - Item 4: 53

Let's try to allocate the items to maximize the satisfaction of the agents by selecting the highest value items for each agent:

1. Agent 2 should get Item 2, as it is the highest-valued item for them (97).
2. Agent 1 should get Item 1, as it is the highest-valued item for them (82).
3. Agent 0 should get Item 3, as it is the highest-valued item for them (86).

Now, we have allocated 3 items, and 2 remain. We should look at the remaining highest values for the agents:

4. Agent 2 should get Item 0, as it is the next highest value (83).
5. Agent 1 should get Item 4, as it has a high value (75).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and aims to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
