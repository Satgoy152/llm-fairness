Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  61  50   7  40
1  99  80  51  73  61
2  26   6  49  90  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent. We will consider the highest valuations for each agent and distribute the items accordingly, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (68), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (99), but since item 0 is already allocated, we move to the next highest valuation, which is item 1 (80) for agent 1. So, we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (90), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Now we allocate the remaining items (2, 4) to the agents based on their next highest valuations:
   - Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (51), so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (40), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.

The final allocation is:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Item 3

Presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
