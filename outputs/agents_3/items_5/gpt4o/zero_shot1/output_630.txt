Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  35  22  24  81
1  18  19  81  25  62
2  29  19  73  61  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the valuations provided. A common approach to fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives or to ensure some level of fairness such as envy-freeness or maximin share guarantee. Here, I'll aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives:

Valuation Table:
- Agent 0: [61, 35, 22, 24, 81]
- Agent 1: [18, 19, 81, 25, 62]
- Agent 2: [29, 19, 73, 61, 40]

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's happiness:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 4 (value 81).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 81).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 61).

Now, allocate the remaining items considering each agent's remaining preferences:

- Item 0 (value 61): Currently unallocated. Agent 0 values it the highest (value 61).
- Item 1 (value 35): Currently unallocated. Agent 0 values it the highest (value 35).

Final allocation based on maximizing the total value:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Item 4 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it the highest).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
