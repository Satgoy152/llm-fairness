Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11   2  85  47  22
1  22  98  41  46  85
2  28  18  59  95  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering that each agent should get at least one item, given that there are 5 items and 3 agents. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 with a value of 85.
   - Second highest valuation: Item 3 with a value of 47.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 with a value of 98.
   - Second highest valuation: Item 4 with a value of 85.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 with a value of 95.
   - Second highest valuation: Item 4 with a value of 72.

To ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, we can start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent and then distribute the remaining items. Here's how it can be done:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 2 (85) and Item 0 (11).
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 1 (98).
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 3 (95) and Item 4 (72).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
