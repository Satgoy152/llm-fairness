Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  21  73  77  60
1  33  57  53  82  19
2  77  63  81  73  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 77.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 82.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 82.

2. **Allocating Highest Valued Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it is valued the maximum by Agent 1 (82).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since it is valued the maximum by Agent 2 (82).

3. **Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Now, we need to allocate items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 73.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the next highest at 59.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - The only remaining item is 1.

4. **Assigning the Last Item:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 57, which is the highest valuation among the remaining unallocated items.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

5. **Review and Adjust if Necessary:**
   - Ensure that the distribution is fair and that no items are left unallocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are fairly distributed based on the agents' valuations.
