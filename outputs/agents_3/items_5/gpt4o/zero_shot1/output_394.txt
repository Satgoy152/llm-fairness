Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  23  29  62  63
1  33   2  72   2  36
2  18  26  48   0  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring every item is assigned to just one agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (63), Item 3 (62), Item 2 (29).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (72), Item 0 (33), Item 4 (36).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (86), Item 2 (48), Item 1 (26).

To ensure fairness, we'll allocate based on the highest valuations while considering each agent's highest preferred available item:

- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (86), allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 1 (72), allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (62), allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Next highest valuation is by Agent 1 (33), allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 2 (26), allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
