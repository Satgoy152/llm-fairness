Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  89  62  71  59
1  98  37  10  27  53
2  24  73  65  75  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [54, 89, 62, 71, 59]
- Agent 1: [98, 37, 10, 27, 53]
- Agent 2: [24, 73, 65, 75, 96]

One possible fair allocation strategy is to maximize the total value each agent gets from the allocated items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Assign highest valued items**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 98.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 89.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 96.

2. **Assign remaining items considering next highest values**:
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values item 2 at 65, which is higher than Agent 0's 62 and Agent 1's 10.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values item 3 at 75, which is higher than Agent 0's 71 and Agent 1's 27.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an item. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations and ensures a fair distribution based on given preferences.
