Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  55  52  99  52
1  29  54  52   6  61
2  32  87  79  60  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least some value. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Examine the table to see which agents value which items the most.
2. **Allocate Uniquely Valued Items**: Assign any items that are uniquely valued highest by a single agent.
3. **Balance Remaining Allocations**: For items valued highly by multiple agents, attempt to distribute them so that no agent feels significantly undervalued.

### Analysis:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 2 values it at 32, which is the highest.
- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 2 values it at 87, which is the highest.
- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 2 values it at 79, which is the highest.
- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 99, which is the highest.
- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 2 values it at 91, which is the highest.

### Proposed Allocation:

Given these valuations, Agent 2 has the highest valuations for 4 out of 5 items. To fairly allocate the items, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 3 (which they value the highest at 99).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 4 (which is not the highest for them, but ensures they get an item).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate Items 0, 1, and 2 (they have the highest valuations for these).

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with Agent 2 receiving more due to their higher valuations on those items.
