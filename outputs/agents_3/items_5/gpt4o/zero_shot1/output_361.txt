Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8   4   5   8  45
1   9  99  95  55  16
2  56  91  44  54  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are three agents and five items, each agent should ideally get at least one item, with one agent receiving two items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's preference:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 45. Since no other agent values item 4 as highly as agent 0, allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 99. Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
   - Agent 1 also values item 2 quite highly at 95. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 56. Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Now, only item 3 remains unallocated:

4. **Remaining Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 55, which is higher than the other agents' valuations (Agent 0 values it at 8 and Agent 2 at 54). Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing their respective valuations.
