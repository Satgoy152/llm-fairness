Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  93  48  30  10
1  14  23  85  35  19
2  27  10  69  44  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value for all agents, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 93. Assign item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 85. Assign item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 69, but item 2 is already allocated. Next highest is item 3 with a value of 44. Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**: Items 0 and 4 are left. We need to allocate these to agents to balance the allocation:
   - Agent 0 has a good valuation for item 0 (67).
   - Agent 1 and agent 2 both have low valuations for item 4, but since agent 1 has only one item, allocate item 4 to agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 3

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers the valuations and tries to distribute the items fairly among the agents.
