Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  61  89   4  35
1  10  43  82  45  64
2  22  51  66  34  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the satisfaction for each agent, considering their valuations. One such approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [90, 61, 89, 4, 35]
- Agent 1 values: [10, 43, 82, 45, 64]
- Agent 2 values: [22, 51, 66, 34, 26]

Now, we'll assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 61.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 45.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 64.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

After allocating the items, we have the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: No items

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```
