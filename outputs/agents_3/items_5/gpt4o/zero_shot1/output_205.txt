Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  90  98  74  36
1  67  74   3  18  80
2  55  76  25  45  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Review the table to identify which agent values each item the most, aiming to allocate the item to that agent if possible.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating items based on the highest value for each item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and distribute remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's the initial allocation based on maximum valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 at 67, Agent 2 at 55. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 74, Agent 2 at 76. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 3, Agent 2 at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 18, Agent 2 at 45. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 80, Agent 2 at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, adjust to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 has 3 items (1, 2, 3).
- Agent 1 has 2 items (0, 4).
- Agent 2 has 0 items, which is not allowed.

To ensure Agent 2 receives at least one item, we can adjust allocation:

- Move item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has the second-highest value for item 3.

This adjustment results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 3

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
