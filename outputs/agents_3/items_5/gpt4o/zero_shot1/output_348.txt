Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  12  70  82  49
1  11  62  82  72  80
2   8  59  12  76  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item or as balanced a distribution as possible based on their valuations. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to the agents who value them the most, making sure each item is allocated only once and each agent can receive any number of items.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 8
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 62
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 70
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 72
   - Agent 2 values it at 76
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

Now let's represent the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all items are allocated and no agent receives more items than available.
