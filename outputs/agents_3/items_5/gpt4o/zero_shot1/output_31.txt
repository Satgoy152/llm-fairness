Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  13  50  87  19
1  20  32  21  38   1
2  31  88  45  85  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation for items: 0 (95), 3 (87)
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuation for items: 1 (32), 3 (38)
   - Since item 3 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuation for items: 1 (88), 4 (89)
   - Since item 1 is already allocated, allocate item 2 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of allocated items is 5.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
