Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  93  81  19  99
1  25  67  41   7  58
2  51  33  23  79  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 67 41  7 58]
 [51 33 23 79 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while considering their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value received by each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values for items: [24, 93, 81, 19, 99]
   - Highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 1 (93)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values for items: [25, 67, 41, 7, 58]
   - Highest values: Item 1 (67), Item 4 (58)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values for items: [51, 33, 23, 79, 52]
   - Highest values: Item 3 (79), Item 0 (51)

Next, let's allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 4, as it is the highest value for them.
- **Agent 1** can take Item 1, one of their higher valued items that Agent 0 also wants but Agent 0 already got a high-value item.
- **Agent 2** should get Item 3, as it is the highest value for them.
- Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 2.
  - Give Item 0 to Agent 2 since it's their second-highest value.
  - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 since it is still valuable to them after Item 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
