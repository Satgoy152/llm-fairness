Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  68  51  94  94
1  10  44  73  18   2
2  44  27  35   7  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Here are the given valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  68  51  94  94
1  10  44  73  18   2
2  44  27  35   7  64
```

Let's consider the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Clearly values items 0, 3, and 4 the highest.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a strong preference for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest after its preference.

Based on these preferences and the need to distribute 5 items:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 0, 3, and 4, so we allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 the most, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has relatively higher valuations for items 1 and 4 compared to the others, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2. 

This leaves item 4 unallocated. Agent 0 values item 4 the same as item 3 and has an overall higher valuation for items compared to others. We allocate item 4 to Agent 0 to maximize the total valuation.

Thus, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
