Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  26  54  81  20
1  55  58  52  23  24
2  15  53  29   6  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to do this is to assign items to the agents based on the highest individual valuations.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. List all possible item-agent valuation pairs.
2. Sort these pairs by valuation in descending order.
3. Allocate items to agents based on the highest available valuations, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent can receive multiple items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 20

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 24

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 15
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 6
  - Item 4: 40

Let's list and sort these by value:

1. Agent 0, Item 0: 97
2. Agent 0, Item 3: 81
3. Agent 1, Item 1: 58
4. Agent 0, Item 2: 54
5. Agent 1, Item 0: 55
6. Agent 2, Item 1: 53
7. Agent 1, Item 2: 52
8. Agent 2, Item 4: 40
9. Agent 0, Item 1: 26
10. Agent 1, Item 4: 24
11. Agent 1, Item 3: 23
12. Agent 2, Item 2: 29
13. Agent 0, Item 4: 20
14. Agent 2, Item 0: 15
15. Agent 2, Item 3: 6

Now, allocate items:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 97).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 81).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 58).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 54).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 40).

After assigning these items, all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3, 2].
- Agent 1 receives items [1].
- Agent 2 receives items [4].

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
