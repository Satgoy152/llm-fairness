Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  24  94  54   7
1  92  91  16  95  49
2  85  19  23  63  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. Since we have 3 agents and 5 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Let's allocate the items based on the highest values each agent has for the items.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [18, 24, 94, 54, 7]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (94)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [92, 91, 16, 95, 49]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (95)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [85, 19, 23, 63, 68]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (85)

Now, we have allocated items 2, 3, and 0 to agents 0, 1, and 2 respectively. We still have items 1 and 4 left to allocate. We should aim for the next-highest values for the agents who received the least value from their first item.

Remaining items: 1, 4

- Agent 0 has received item 2 (value 94).
- Agent 1 has received item 3 (value 95).
- Agent 2 has received item 0 (value 85).

Next, we'll allocate the remaining items:

- For item 1 (values: 24, 91, 19):
  - Allocate to Agent 1, as they have the highest value for this item and have received the highest value item already (95).

- For item 4 (values: 7, 49, 68):
  - Allocate to Agent 2, as they have the highest remaining value for this item.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
