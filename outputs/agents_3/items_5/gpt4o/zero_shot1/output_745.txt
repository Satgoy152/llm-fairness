Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  65  83  75  51
1  28  95  88  92  75
2  13  43  48  12  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One common approach is to use the "maximizing total utility" method, which attempts to allocate items such that the total sum of the values received by all agents is maximized. Let's analyze the given values and make allocations accordingly:

The valuations matrix is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  65  83  75  51
1  28  95  88  92  75
2  13  43  48  12  37
```

To allocate items fairly, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across agents.
2. Allocate items to the agents with the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- For item 0, Agent 1 values it highest at 28.
- For item 1, Agent 1 values it highest at 95.
- For item 2, Agent 0 values it highest at 83.
- For item 3, Agent 1 values it highest at 92.
- For item 4, Agent 1 values it highest at 75.

From this analysis, Agent 1 has the highest valuation for four items (0, 1, 3, 4), and Agent 0 has the highest valuation for one item (2). Agent 2 does not have the highest valuation for any item.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 gets no items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are allocated and that each agent gets an integer number of items.
