Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  15  10  75  44
1  77   9  52  98  48
2  55  99  99   5  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the most at 93.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the most at 98.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the most at 99.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the most at 99.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it at 44, which is the highest remaining valuation among agents.

This allocation maximizes the individual satisfaction for each item while ensuring each agent gets the items they value highly.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
