Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96   0  80  21  88
1  20  12  70  40  67
2  67   8  42  42  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20 12 70 40 67]
 [67  8 42 42 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Since there are 5 items and 3 agents, some agents will get more items than others. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Valuation is 96 (highest valuation for item 0)
   - Item 2: Valuation is 80 (highest valuation for item 2)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3: Valuation is 40 (highest valuation for item 3 among available items)
   - Item 4: Valuation is 67 (second-highest valuation for item 4 but highest for agent 1)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1: Valuation is 8 (only remaining item)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
