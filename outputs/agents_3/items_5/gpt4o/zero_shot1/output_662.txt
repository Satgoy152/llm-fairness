Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77   3  85  45  57
1  47  57  86  72  89
2  79  35  42  93  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 77
   - Item 2: 85 (highest value for agent 0)
   - Item 3: 45
   - Item 4: 57

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 2: 86 (highest value for agent 1)
   - Item 4: 89 (highest value for agent 1)
   - Item 3: 72

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 3: 93 (highest value for agent 2)
   - Item 0: 79
   - Item 4: 74

To maximize the satisfaction of each agent, we can allocate items based on the highest values they assign to the items, ensuring each item is allocated only once:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets Item 4, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3, which has the highest value for them.

For the remaining items (0 and 1), we consider the next highest available values:

- Agent 2 can take Item 0 (valuing it at 79), as Agent 0 and Agent 1 have already received items.
- Agent 0 can take Item 1 (valuing it at 3, which is low but it's the only remaining option).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
