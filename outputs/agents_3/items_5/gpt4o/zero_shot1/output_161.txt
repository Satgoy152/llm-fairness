Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  49  45  53  18
1   4  16  57  21  15
2  41  84  34  16  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with highest valuations for Agent 0.
   - Items: 3 (valuation = 53) and 2 (valuation = 45)
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with highest valuations for Agent 1.
   - Item: 2 (valuation = 57) - Already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next highest is Item: 3 (valuation = 21)
   - Allocate Item: 4 (valuation = 15)
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with highest valuations for Agent 2.
   - Item: 1 (valuation = 84)
   - Item: 0 (valuation = 41)

Based on these priorities and ensuring each item is assigned, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are fairly distributed based on the valuations.
