Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  34  60  12  53
1  64  66  77  71  81
2  58  73  52  83  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 34 60 12 53]
 [64 66 77 71 81]
 [58 73 52 83 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [92, 34, 60, 12, 53]
- Agent 1: [64, 66, 77, 71, 81]
- Agent 2: [58, 73, 52, 83, 22]

By examining the valuations, we can try to allocate the items to maximize the value for each agent, while also ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 92), so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 81), so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 83), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now we have assigned three items, and we need to assign the remaining two items (items 1 and 2) to agents who have not yet received an item.

4. **Remaining items**:
    - For item 1: 
        - Agent 0 values it at 34
        - Agent 1 values it at 66
        - Agent 2 values it at 73
      Item 1 should be assigned to Agent 2, maximizing their total value.
      
    - For item 2:
        - Agent 0 values it at 60
        - Agent 1 values it at 77
        - Agent 2 values it at 52
      Item 2 should be assigned to Agent 1, maximizing their total value.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
