Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26   4  87  98   3
1  59  46  35  87   1
2  58  33  96  32  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** We'll start by identifying which agent values each item the most, as this could lead to a fair allocation where each agent maximizes their utility.

2. **Allocate Items:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are allocated.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Check if the distribution of items results in each agent having at least one item. If not, try to reallocate items to ensure fairness.

Let's analyze the given data:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 0 values at 26
  - Agent 1 values at 59 (highest value)
  - Agent 2 values at 58

- **Item 1:** 
  - Agent 0 values at 4
  - Agent 1 values at 46 (highest value)
  - Agent 2 values at 33

- **Item 2:** 
  - Agent 0 values at 87
  - Agent 1 values at 35
  - Agent 2 values at 96 (highest value)

- **Item 3:** 
  - Agent 0 values at 98 (highest value)
  - Agent 1 values at 87
  - Agent 2 values at 32

- **Item 4:** 
  - Agent 0 values at 3
  - Agent 1 values at 1
  - Agent 2 values at 85 (highest value)

From this analysis, we can assign items as follows:

- **Item 0** to Agent 1
- **Item 1** to Agent 1
- **Item 2** to Agent 2
- **Item 3** to Agent 0
- **Item 4** to Agent 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, while also distributing all five items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their total valuation based on the given table.
