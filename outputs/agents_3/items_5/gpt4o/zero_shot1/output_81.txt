Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  58  46  50  74
1  99  92  79  98   5
2  35  89  71  65  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [99 92 79 98  5]
 [35 89 71 65 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  58  46  50  74
1  99  92  79  98   5
2  35  89  71  65  50
```

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (99) and high valuations for items 1 (92) and 3 (98). Thus, they should receive some of these items.
2. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1 (89) and a decent valuation for item 2 (71).
3. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 4 (74).

Based on these observations, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 1**: Assign items 0 and 3. (Valuations: 99 and 98)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1. (Valuation: 89)
- **Agent 0**: Assign items 4 and 2. (Valuations: 74 and 46)

This allocation maximizes the total valuation and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
