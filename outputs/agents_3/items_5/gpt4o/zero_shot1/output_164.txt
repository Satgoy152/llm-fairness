Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83   8  19  22  86
1  75  16  82  96  95
2  15  70  97  48  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it most. Let's go through the items one by one and assign each to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 83
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Agent 2 values it at 15
   - Assign to Agent 0

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - Assign to Agent 2

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Assign to Agent 2

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Assign to Agent 1

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 95
   - Agent 2 values it at 21
   - Assign to Agent 1

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, which is a common method for distributing items fairly in scenarios like this.
