Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  43  99  23  25
1  62  31  57  83  91
2  46  11   5  52  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent places on each item**:
   - Agent 0: [84, 43, 99, 23, 25]
   - Agent 1: [62, 31, 57, 83, 91]
   - Agent 2: [46, 11, 5, 52, 92]

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation**:
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (84)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (43)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (99)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (83)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (92)

3. **Ensure all agents get items**:
   - Review allocations to ensure fairness and adjust if necessary.

After evaluating the allocations and maximizing the total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations.
