Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  84  18  86  20
1  35  65  98  29  32
2  41  29  22  96  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 4: 20

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 29
  - Item 4: 32

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 63

A reasonable approach for fair allocation is to assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Initial Assignments**:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (highest value for agent 0 is 86)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (highest value for agent 1 is 98)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (highest value for agent 2 is 96, but already taken by agent 0)

2. **Adjustments**:
   - Since item 3 is already taken by agent 0, agent 2 can be assigned their next highest valued item, which is item 4 (value 63).

3. **Unallocated Items**:
   - Items 0 and 1 remain unallocated.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 can take item 1 (second highest value 84)
   - Agent 2 can take item 0 (next highest value 41)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is assigned items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
