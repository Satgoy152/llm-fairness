Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  18  12  27  72
1  40   5  41  74  12
2  41  37  40  94  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 4 (72).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 3 (74).
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 3 (94), but item 3 is already taken. The next highest is item 2 (40).

Now, we should allocate the remaining items:

4. **Remaining Items (0, 1)**:
   - Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 0 (43) and item 1 (18). Assign both to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2

This ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
