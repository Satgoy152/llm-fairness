Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  52  24  42  66
1  48  65  55  92  39
2  91  51  14  66  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [91 51 14 66 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Based on the given valuations:

```
          Items
      0   1   2   3   4
A0  49  52  24  42  66
A1  48  65  55  92  39
A2  91  51  14  66  34
```

Here's a possible approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 66)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 92)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 91)

Now, for the remaining items:

- **Items 1 and 2:**
  - For Item 1, Agent 1 has the highest value (65)
  - For Item 2, Agent 1 has the highest value as well (55)

Since Agent 1 already has one item, we should distribute to ensure fairness:

- Give Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Item 1)
- Give Item 2 to Agent 1

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total value while distributing the items fairly.
