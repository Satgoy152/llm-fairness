Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  44  67  96  52
1  42  27  88  41  50
2  49  54  60  97  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize their satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation:

Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 3 and 0, so we could prioritize those for them. Agent 1 values item 2 significantly higher than the others, so we should consider giving them item 2. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest, but since it is already assigned to agent 0, we could consider other high-value items for agent 2.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (since agent 1 values it the most).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it highly, and agent 2 values it the highest but can get compensated with another item).
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it more than the other agents).
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
