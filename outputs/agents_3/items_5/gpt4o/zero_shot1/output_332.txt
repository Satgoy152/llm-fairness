Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  35  94  22  23
1  16  75  76  28  87
2  13  42  16  42  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [13 42 16 42 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 2 (value 94)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 1 (value 75)
   - Item 4 (value 87)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 0 (value 13)
   - Item 3 (value 42)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations while all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
