Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  35  54   8  49
1  57  99   3  86  89
2   7  32  68  22  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives by considering each agent's preference for the items. We'll attempt to assign items in a way that balances the total value distribution across the agents. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (66), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (99), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (68), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (86), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (89), but agent 0 is currently under-allocated, so assign item 4 to agent 0 to balance the distribution.

Based on this allocation strategy, we achieve a balance where each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring everyone gets at least one item.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
