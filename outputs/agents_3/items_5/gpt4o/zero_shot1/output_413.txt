Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  21  39  77  10
1  78   1  81  19  41
2  57  72  42  88  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [57 72 42 88 20]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent or ensure that each agent receives at least one item they highly value. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [0, 21, 39, 77, 10]
   - Highest value is for item 3 (77).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [78, 1, 81, 19, 41]
   - Highest value is for item 2 (81).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [57, 72, 42, 88, 20]
   - Highest value is for item 3 (88), but item 3 is already allocated to agent 0, so the next highest value is item 1 (72).

Given these considerations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0 (total value = 77 + 0 = 77)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4 (total value = 81 + 41 = 122)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (total value = 72)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
