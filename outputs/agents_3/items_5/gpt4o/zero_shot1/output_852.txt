Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98   8   1  80  75
1  47  18  96  57  63
2  79  76  36  92  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value is 98.
   - Item 3: Value is 80.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Value is 96.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Value is 76.
   - Item 4: Value is 85.

This allocation gives us the following:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3 for a total value of 178.
- Agent 1 receives item 2 for a value of 96.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4 for a total value of 161.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
