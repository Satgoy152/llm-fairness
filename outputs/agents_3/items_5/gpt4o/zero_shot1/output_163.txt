Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  27  46  50   1
1  56  96   4  78  98
2  88  40  49  17  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [56 96  4 78 98]
 [88 40 49 17 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets approximately the same number of items, if possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0 valuations: [81, 27, 46, 50, 1]
Agent 1 valuations: [56, 96, 4, 78, 98]
Agent 2 valuations: [88, 40, 49, 17, 53]
```

Given that we have 5 items and 3 agents, a fair allocation would typically mean each agent gets approximately 5/3 â‰ˆ 1.67 items. Since we can't allocate a fraction of an item, some agents will receive 2 items, and some will receive 1 item.

To maximize fairness and value, we can try the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly compared to other agents.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.

Let's propose an allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 can take item 2 as it has a relatively moderate value for that agent.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 1-2 items and the total value for each agent is considered.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the first and fourth items, Agent 1 the second and fifth items, and Agent 2 the third item.
