Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  47  41  81  15
1  56  97  40  35  70
2  27   4  42  60  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes their overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use a method like the maximum sum allocation, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [95, 47, 41, 81, 15]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [56, 97, 40, 35, 70]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [27, 4, 42, 60, 97]

Let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 42.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.

Now, let's distribute these allocations in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation reflects the highest valuations for each item.
