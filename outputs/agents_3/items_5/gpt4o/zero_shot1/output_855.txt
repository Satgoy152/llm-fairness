Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  35  15  58  67
1  87  96  89  31  92
2  62  75  71  70  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Assign Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 96.

2. **Assign Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.

3. **Assign Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 58.

4. **Assign Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 89.

5. **Assign Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 87.

Now, let's distribute the items based on these assignments:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

Using this allocation, the JSON representation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "2": []
}
```
