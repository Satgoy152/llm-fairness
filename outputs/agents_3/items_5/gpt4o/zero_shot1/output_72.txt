Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  83  48   8   4
1  95  27   8  56  88
2  71  53   2  56  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items assigned to them, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

    | Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Agent 2 |
    |------|---------|---------|---------|
    | 0    | 78      | 95      | 71      |
    | 1    | 83      | 27      | 53      |
    | 2    | 48      | 8       | 2       |
    | 3    | 8       | 56      | 56      |
    | 4    | 4       | 88      | 40      |

2. **Allocate items to agents by maximizing their individual valuations:**

    - **Agent 1** has the highest valuation (95) for Item 0.
    - **Agent 0** has the highest valuation (83) for Item 1.
    - **Agent 2** and Agent 1 both value Item 3 at 56. To balance allocations, give Item 3 to **Agent 2**.
    - **Agent 1** has the highest valuation (88) for Item 4.
    - **Agent 0** is left with Item 2.

3. **Check allocations:**

   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 4]
   - Agent 2: Item [3]

4. **Ensure all agents have at least one item if possible:**

   Since each agent already has at least one item, the allocation is balanced.

5. **Present the allocation in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the individual valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
