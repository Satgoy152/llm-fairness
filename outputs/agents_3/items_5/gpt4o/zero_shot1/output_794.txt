Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39   8  28  16  34
1  37  23  54  55  25
2  67  29  78  41  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we strive to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. This can often be achieved by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the valuations:

1. For item 0, the valuations are: 
   - Agent 0: 39
   - Agent 1: 37
   - Agent 2: 67 (highest)
   
2. For item 1, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 8
   - Agent 1: 23
   - Agent 2: 29 (highest)

3. For item 2, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 28
   - Agent 1: 54 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 78 (highest)

4. For item 3, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 16
   - Agent 1: 55 (highest)
   - Agent 2: 41
   
5. For item 4, the valuations are:
   - Agent 0: 34
   - Agent 1: 25
   - Agent 2: 71 (highest)

Based on the highest valuations, the initial allocation would be:
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.

Since Agent 2 is getting three items and Agent 1 is getting two, this allocation satisfies the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
