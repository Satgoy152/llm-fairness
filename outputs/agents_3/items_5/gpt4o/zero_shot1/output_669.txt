Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  67  25  10  87
1  59  65  13  34   6
2   8  77  47  29   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (90), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (65), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (47), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Returning to agent 0, the next highest value is item 4 (87), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
5. The remaining item is 3. Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (34), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total value is maximized for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
