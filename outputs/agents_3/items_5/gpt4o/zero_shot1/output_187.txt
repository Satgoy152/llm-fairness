Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  77  70  47   3
1  39  86   5  97  74
2  30  45  39  22  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [39 86  5 97 74]
 [30 45 39 22 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the individual valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. A fair approach could be to use the "maximum total valuation" method, where we try to maximize the sum of the valuations for the entire allocation.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values: [35, 77, 70, 47, 3]
- Agent 1 values: [39, 86, 5, 97, 74]
- Agent 2 values: [30, 45, 39, 22, 46]

We aim to assign each item to an agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than 3 items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 39, Agent 0 at 35, and Agent 2 at 30. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it at 86, Agent 0 at 77, and Agent 2 at 45. Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 2 at 39, and Agent 1 at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it at 97, Agent 0 at 47, and Agent 2 at 22. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it at 74, Agent 2 at 46, and Agent 0 at 3. Assign to Agent 2.

However, Agent 1 gets 4 items, which is not allowed. We need to adjust so that each agent does not exceed 3 items.

Let's allocate:

- **Item 0:** Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3:** Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Assign to Agent 2.

This gives us:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Item [4]

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
