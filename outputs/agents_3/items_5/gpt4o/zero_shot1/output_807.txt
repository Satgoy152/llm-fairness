Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  67  72  32  23
1  68  45  84  70  60
2  74  23  71  28  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's evaluate some potential allocations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2, item 1 to agent 0, item 2 to agent 1, item 3 to agent 1, and item 4 to agent 0. This ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

   - Agent 0: Total valuation = 67 (item 1) + 23 (item 4) = 90
   - Agent 1: Total valuation = 84 (item 2) + 70 (item 3) = 154
   - Agent 2: Total valuation = 74 (item 0) = 74

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total value for each agent is maximized based on their preferences.

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
