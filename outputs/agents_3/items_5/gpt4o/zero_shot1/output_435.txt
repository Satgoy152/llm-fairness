Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  98  21  64  3  90
1   2  97  14  5  56
2  10  75  38  1  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 21 64  3 90]
 [ 2 97 14  5 56]
 [10 75 38  1 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A fair allocation could be based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [98, 21, 64, 3, 90]
- Agent 1: [2, 97, 14, 5, 56]
- Agent 2: [10, 75, 38, 1, 77]

We will try to allocate items in a way that maximizes valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (98).

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (97).

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (64).

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation for Item 3 (5) compared to other agents.

5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (77).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and that all items are allocated.
