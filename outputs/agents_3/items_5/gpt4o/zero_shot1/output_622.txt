Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  50  65  21  62
1  24  78  64  23  25
2  74  77  87  56   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 78 64 23 25]
 [74 77 87 56  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to achieve this is to use a maximum weight matching in a bipartite graph, where agents and items form the two sets of the bipartite graph, and the edges are weighted by the valuations.

Let's look at the valuations table again:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  50  65  21  62
1  24  78  64  23  25
2  74  77  87  56   4
```

We need to allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents. Let's consider a strategy to maximize each agent's benefit:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest (87).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the highest (78).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it highly (74).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highly (62).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it (21) and it's a better allocation than to others.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
