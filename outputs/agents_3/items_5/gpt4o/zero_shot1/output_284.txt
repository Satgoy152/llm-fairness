Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  90  54  33  93
1  92  63  73  34   5
2   6  49  61  91  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 63 73 34  5]
 [ 6 49 61 91 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [82, 90, 54, 33, 93]
- Agent 1: [92, 63, 73, 34, 5]
- Agent 2: [6, 49, 61, 91, 38]

First, let's identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate the item to the corresponding agent:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values at 82
   - Agent 1 values at 92
   - Agent 2 values at 6
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values at 90
   - Agent 1 values at 63
   - Agent 2 values at 49
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values at 54
   - Agent 1 values at 73
   - Agent 2 values at 61
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values at 33
   - Agent 1 values at 34
   - Agent 2 values at 91
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values at 93
   - Agent 1 values at 5
   - Agent 2 values at 38
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
