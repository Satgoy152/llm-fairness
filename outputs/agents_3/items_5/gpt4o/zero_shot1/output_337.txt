Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  93  45  65  21
1  95  62  32  91  93
2  54  66  68  70  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 62 32 91 93]
 [54 66 68 70 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a fair allocation.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0: [28, 93, 45, 65, 21]
- Agent 1: [95, 62, 32, 91, 93]
- Agent 2: [54, 66, 68, 70, 88]

Let's consider a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (93).
2. Assign item 0 and 4 to Agent 1, who values them significantly (95 and 93 respectively).
3. Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2, who values them (68 and 70).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable portion of the items based on their preferences.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation uses all 5 items, and each agent receives at least one item based on their valuations.
