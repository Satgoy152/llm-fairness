Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90   2  85  68  73
1  96  12  59  87   4
2  91  65  64  28  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We will look for a distribution where each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the sum of valuations for all agents.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 90, Item 1: 2, Item 2: 85, Item 3: 68, Item 4: 73
- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 96, Item 1: 12, Item 2: 59, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 4
- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 91, Item 1: 65, Item 2: 64, Item 3: 28, Item 4: 20

To ensure fairness and maximize the total valuation, we will proceed with a greedy algorithm, choosing the highest value item for each agent in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 is assigned Item 0 (value 90).
2. Agent 1 is assigned Item 3 (value 87).
3. Agent 2 is assigned Item 1 (value 65).

Now, we have 2 items left to allocate: Items 2 and 4.

Continuing with the highest remaining value for the remaining items:

4. Agent 0 is assigned Item 2 (value 85).
5. Agent 2 is assigned Item 4 (value 20).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and ensures a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
