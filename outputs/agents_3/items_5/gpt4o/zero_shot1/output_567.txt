Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  89  59  78  19
1  64  41  46  26  22
2  61  75  37  13  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 5 items allocated in total. Let's proceed with a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Item 1: Value 89
    - Item 3: Value 78

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Item 0: Value 64
    - Item 2: Value 46

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Item 4: Value 69

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total value of 167 (89 + 78)
- Agent 1 a total value of 110 (64 + 46)
- Agent 2 a total value of 69

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items to maximize each agent's total value based on their valuations.

Now, in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed among the agents.
