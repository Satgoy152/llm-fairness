Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  93  23  39  76
1  29  45  68  98  11
2  62  14  74  36  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. One approach is to use the Maximum Weighted Matching algorithm, but for simplicity, we can manually allocate based on maximizing individual agent's preferences. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (93)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (84)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (98)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (74)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (41)

With these considerations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1
- Agent 1 gets item 3
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 4

This allocation ensures that the total number of items is 5 and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
