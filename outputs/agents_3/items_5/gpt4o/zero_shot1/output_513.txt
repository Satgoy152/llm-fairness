Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81   6  66  69  15
1  73  94  45   8  62
2  47  54  23   1  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [47 54 23  1 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's examine the valuations and make allocations accordingly.

Here are the valuations again for reference:

- Agent 0: [81, 6, 66, 69, 15]
- Agent 1: [73, 94, 45, 8, 62]
- Agent 2: [47, 54, 23, 1, 51]

Let's try to make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0 (81) and item 3 (69).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (94) and a relatively high valuation for item 4 (62).
3. **Agent 2** might receive items that have lower valuations for others, like item 2 (23).

Assigning based on these observations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to respect the highest individual valuations and distributes items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
