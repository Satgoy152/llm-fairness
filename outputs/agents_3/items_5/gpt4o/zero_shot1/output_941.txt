Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96   7   9  89  66
1  60  10  12  44  82
2  49   1  25  17   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item, thereby ensuring that the item goes to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that the allocation is balanced, with each agent getting a reasonable number of items considering their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 7.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 12.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 89.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 82.

Based on these valuations, the optimal allocation can be:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation prioritizes the highest value for each item while ensuring all items are distributed. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 5.
