Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  72  51  66   9
1  23  69  50  79  42
2   1   5  94  21  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent. This can be approached as an optimization problem, seeking to assign items such that the overall satisfaction (value) is maximized while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will assign the items that maximize agent 0's value. The highest valuations for agent 0 are item 1 (72) and item 3 (66). Since we need to balance allocations, we'll start by assigning only item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has high valuations for item 3 (79) and item 1 (69), but since item 3 is already assigned, we can give them item 1 and item 4.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for item 2 (94) and item 4 (88), but since item 4 is already assigned, we will give them item 2.

Therefore, the allocation can be done as follows:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 0]

Now let's put this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
