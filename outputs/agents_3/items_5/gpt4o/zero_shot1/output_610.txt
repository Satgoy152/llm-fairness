Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  26  79  26  37
1  30  78  25  98  96
2  88  67  63  80  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since each agent has their own valuation of the items, we try to distribute the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the highest value item for each agent.
2. Allocate items one by one, starting from the agent with the highest single valuation for any item, and proceed to the next highest.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 88. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 98. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 1 also values item 4 highly at 96. Assign item 4 to agent 1 as well.
4. Agent 2 values item 2 at 63, which is higher than any remaining valuations from agent 0. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
5. Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation of item 1 at 26. Assign item 1 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences, with all 5 items distributed.
