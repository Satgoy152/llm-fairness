Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  64  86  99  13
1  13  33  69  99  19
2  87  73  20  43  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations given:

```
Agent 0: 65, 64, 86, 99, 13
Agent 1: 13, 33, 69, 99, 19
Agent 2: 87, 73, 20, 43, 14
```

The goal is to assign the items such that the overall valuation is maximized. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning high-valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items, as there are only five items.

### Allocation:
- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values this the highest (87).
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 values this the highest (73).
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this the highest (86).
- **Item 3:** Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value this equally (99), but Agent 1 gets it to balance allocations.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 gets this item as Agent 0 has already received one item with high value.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Item 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 3, 4
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 1

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an item based on their valuations.
