Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  14  24  55  93
1  41  65  11  18  29
2   5  27  17  80  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. We also want to ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (72), followed by item 4 (93).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (65).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (80).

Based on this, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 72).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 65).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 80).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 93).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 11).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable total valuation and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4] with a total value of 72 + 93 = 165.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2] with a total value of 65 + 11 = 76.
- Agent 2 receives item [3] with a total value of 80.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
