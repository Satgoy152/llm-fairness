Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  78  42   3  73
1  31  64  48  89  28
2  87  23  43  79  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 1 (78) and 4 (73).
   - Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 3 (89) and 1 (64).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 0 (87) and 3 (79).

2. **Allocate items by highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 87).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 78).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89).

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Agent 0 and Agent 2 have higher valuations for item 4, but Agent 0 has a slightly lower valuation for item 2 than item 4.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 73).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 43).

4. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 2

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
