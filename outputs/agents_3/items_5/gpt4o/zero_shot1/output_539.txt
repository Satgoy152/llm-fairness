Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  55  83  80   8
1  83  77  58  27  78
2  72  68  88  88   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one common approach is to use the "max-min fairness" concept, which tries to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. However, since this is a small problem, we can manually try to allocate the items in a way that seems fair, taking into account each agent's valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [21, 55, 83, 80, 8]
- Agent 1 values: [83, 77, 58, 27, 78]
- Agent 2 values: [72, 68, 88, 88, 5]

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Start by assigning high-value items to agents who highly value them:
   - Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 2 (88).
   - Item 3 is another high-value item for Agent 2 (88).

2. Next, assign remaining high-value items:
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1 (83).
   - Item 1 is next best for Agent 1 (77).

3. Finally, allocate the remaining item:
   - Item 4 can go to Agent 0 (lowest value at 8, but still better than nothing).

Allocation:

- Agent 0: Item [4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute high-value items across the agents, ensuring that each agent gets at least some value relative to their preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
