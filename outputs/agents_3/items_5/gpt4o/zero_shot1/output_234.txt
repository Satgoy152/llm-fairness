Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  30  14  72  96
1   1  27  58   2  99
2  37  42  36  23  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has relatively even valuations but no standout high preferences.

Given these observations, we can try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. 

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 since they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it has a higher valuation from Agent 1 than any other agent.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 since it has a relatively high valuation for them and would give them a fair share.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it also has a relatively high valuation for them.

Thus, the allocations could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the interests of each agent by giving them items they value significantly.
