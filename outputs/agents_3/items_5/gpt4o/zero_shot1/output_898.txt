Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  79   6  77  35
1  95  58  84  82  88
2  73  42  42  18  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items in such a way that maximizes fairness, potentially maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items.

Here's one way to allocate the items considering the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 and also values item 2 and 4 highly.
- Agent 2 has relatively even but lower valuations compared to the other agents.

A possible fair allocation is:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valuation 95).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (valuation 79).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (valuation 84).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (valuation 77).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (valuation 42).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and takes into account their valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
