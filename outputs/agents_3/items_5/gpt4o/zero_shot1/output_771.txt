Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  77  79   8  82
1  69  60  50  79  43
2  38  20  54   0  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value across all agents. We'll try to give each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 69, Agent 2 at 38. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 60, Agent 2 at 20. Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 50, Agent 2 at 54. Agent 0 values it the most.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 at 79, Agent 2 at 0. Agent 1 values it the most.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 43, Agent 2 at 13. Agent 0 values it the most.

Based on this analysis, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": []
}
```
