Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  15  86  65  18
1  13  14  82  17  52
2   9  68  69  34  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly and item 4 moderately.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly and item 2 moderately.

Let's assign items based on these valuations:

- Assign item 2 to **Agent 0** since they have the highest valuation for it among all agents (value = 86).
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 2** since they value it the highest (value = 68).
- Assign item 3 to **Agent 0** as it's their second-highest valued item (value = 65).
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 1** as it's their next highest valued item (value = 52).
- Assign item 0 to **Agent 0** to ensure they get a fair share (value = 51).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are allocated based on maximizing the valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
