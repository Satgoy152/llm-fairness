Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  74  79  66  39
1  47  63  33  84  24
2  82   9  71  82  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 63 33 84 24]
 [82  9 71 82 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction according to their valuations. Let's consider the valuations provided and try to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

The valuation table is:

- Agent 0: [3, 74, 79, 66, 39]
- Agent 1: [47, 63, 33, 84, 24]
- Agent 2: [82, 9, 71, 82, 53]

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest with 82.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest with 74.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest with 79.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest with 84.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the highest with 53.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4]

This allocation takes into account the highest individual valuations for each item while distributing the items fairly among the agents.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
