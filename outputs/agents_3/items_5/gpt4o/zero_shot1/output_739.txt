Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  99  53   5  65
1  69  88  66  99  20
2  52  54   8  92  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents by considering their highest valued items. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (65)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 1 (88)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 1 (54)

Now, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated:

- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Highest value for Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**: Second-highest value for Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Highest value for Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Higher value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 2.
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2**: Remaining item with highest relative value for Agent 2.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints and ensures all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
