Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  34   9  99  98
1  28  84  79   6  72
2  85  52  58  75  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total utility for each agent under the constraint that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest valuation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 99. We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 1 with a value of 84. We allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 85. We allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated items 0, 1, and 3. Next, we look for the remaining items 2 and 4.

4. **Remaining items:** 
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 with a value of 79. We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 with a value of 98. We allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and all items are allocated. Now, we present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
