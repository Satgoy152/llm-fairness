Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  41  77  91  58
1  84  78   2  64   8
2  61  72  87  98  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized.

Let's consider the following strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's how the items can be allocated:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 84, which is the highest among all agents.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 78, which is the highest among all agents.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 87, which is the highest among all agents.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest among all agents.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, which is the highest among all agents.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:
- Agent 0: Only has item 4.
- Agent 1: Has items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2: Has items 2 and 3.

The allocation maximizes the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
