Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  72  14  91  75
1  36  36  81  35  90
2  12  59  71  75  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no items are left unallocated.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [24, 72, 14, 91, 75]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 4 (75)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [36, 36, 81, 35, 90]
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 2 (81)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [12, 59, 71, 75, 74]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (75), Item 2 (71)

Considering the above, we can allocate the items as follows to ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 should get their most valued item, which is item 3.
- Agent 1 should get their most valued item, which is item 4.
- Agent 2 should get their most valued item, which is item 2.

Now we have allocated items 2, 3, and 4. We have items 0 and 1 left to allocate:

- Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 1 (72).
- Agent 1 also values item 0 at 36, but we can allocate it to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has no item with a valuation higher than others for item 0.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair value based on their preferences.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
