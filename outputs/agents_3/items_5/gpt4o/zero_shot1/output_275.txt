Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  44  14  90  97
1  47  74  67  67  85
2  53  42  49  97  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [53 42 49 97 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items to maximize fairness:

```
Agent 0: Values = [32, 44, 14, 90, 97]
Agent 1: Values = [47, 74, 67, 67, 85]
Agent 2: Values = [53, 42, 49, 97, 64]
```

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent first:**

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (97), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (74), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.

2. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   - The remaining items are 0 and 2.
   - Agent 0's next highest value is for item 3, but it's already taken. The next available is item 0 (32).
   - Agent 1's next highest available value is item 0 (47).
   - Agent 2's next highest available is item 2 (49).

Since item 0 is valued more by agent 1 than agent 0, we allocate item 0 to agent 1. Item 2 is then allocated to agent 2.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on their highest valuations available.
