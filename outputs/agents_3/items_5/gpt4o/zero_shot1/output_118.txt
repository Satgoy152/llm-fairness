Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  40  77  88  60
1  67   0  35  42  58
2  63  96  16  26  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing all 5 items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Calculate the total value each agent would receive for different combinations of items and then try to balance the overall allocations such that all items are distributed.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0, but very low or zero for other items.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.

A potential allocation could be:

- Give items 2 and 3 to Agent 0 (valuations: 77 and 88).
- Give item 0 to Agent 1 (valuation: 67).
- Give items 1 and 4 to Agent 2 (valuations: 96 and 78).

This allocation distributes all 5 items fairly, considering the agents' valuations.

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the preferences of each agent.
