Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  41  28  72  27
1  57  99  65  15  28
2  47  50  56  68  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [47 50 56 68 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We will try to distribute the items based on the highest valuations each agent has for them.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  41  28  72  27
1  57  99  65  15  28
2  47  50  56  68  81
```

Based on the values, we can make allocations as follows:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (72). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (99). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (81). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated 3 out of 5 items, and each agent has received one item. We need to allocate 2 more items.

4. Consider the remaining items: 0 and 2.
   - For item 0, Agent 1 has the highest valuation (57), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - For item 2, Agent 1 has the highest valuation (65), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 0, and 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
