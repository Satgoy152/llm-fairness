Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  29  47  64   6
1  93  63  27  51  63
2  72   9  19  12  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to optimize for a balanced distribution based on the given valuations. Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest, followed by item 2. 
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, followed by items 1 and 4 equally.
- Agent 2 values item 0 second highest after item 3, but since item 0 is more valuable to Agent 1, we'll let Agent 1 have item 0.

A fair allocation considering these valuations could be:

- Agent 0 receives item 3 (value 64) and item 2 (value 47).
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (value 93).
- Agent 2 receives item 4 (value 37) and item 1 (value 9).

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
