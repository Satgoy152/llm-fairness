Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  18   6  68  26
1  16  58   4  23  61
2   2  51  39  68  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to this allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [17, 18, 6, 68, 26]
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is for item 3 (value 68).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [16, 58, 4, 23, 61]
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is for item 4 (value 61).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [2, 51, 39, 68, 40]
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is for item 3 (value 68). But item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, so consider the next highest value.
   - Next highest value for Agent 2 is for item 1 (value 51).

Now we check to see which items are left and allocate them to the agents based on their remaining highest valuations:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 2

4. **Allocating Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0:
     - Highest remaining value for item 0 is for Agent 1 (value 16).

   - Item 2:
     - Highest remaining value for item 2 is for Agent 2 (value 39).

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
