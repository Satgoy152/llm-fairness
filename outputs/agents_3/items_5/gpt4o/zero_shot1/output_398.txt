Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  29  46  92  68
1  61  55  76  80  68
2  21  52  22  38  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item and determine which agent values it the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 21
   - Agent 1 values it the most, so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it the most, so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it the most, so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 38
   - Agent 0 values it the most, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it the most, so assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
