Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  36  91  24  11
1   9  33  73  95  86
2  91  12   5  26  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [91 12  5 26 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. We can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [72, 36, 91, 24, 11]
   - Best items by value: Item 2 (91), Item 0 (72)
  
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [9, 33, 73, 95, 86]
   - Best items by value: Item 3 (95), Item 4 (86)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuations: [91, 12, 5, 26, 27]
   - Best item by value: Item 0 (91)

Considering these valuations, we can allocate items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets their fair share:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
