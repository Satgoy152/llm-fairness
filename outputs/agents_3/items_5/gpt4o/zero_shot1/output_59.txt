Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  65   8  93  55
1  76  90  69  31  46
2  52  10   6  20  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's examine the valuations and decide on the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 30
- Item 1: 65
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 93
- Item 4: 55

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 76
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 69
- Item 3: 31
- Item 4: 46

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 10
- Item 2: 6
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 32

Let's consider the highest valuations for each item and allocate them accordingly to maximize fairness:

1. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 with a value of 93.
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 with a value of 90.
3. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 1 with a value of 76.
4. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0 with a value of 55.
5. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 with a value of 69.

Allocating based on the above:
- Agent 0 receives Item 3 and Item 4.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0, Item 1, and Item 2.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": []
}
```
