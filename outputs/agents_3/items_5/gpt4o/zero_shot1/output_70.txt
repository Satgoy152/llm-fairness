Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  41  97  11  50
1  42   7  87  91  47
2  98  12  22  18  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 12 22 18 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [4, 41, 97, 11, 50]
- Agent 1 values: [42, 7, 87, 91, 47]
- Agent 2 values: [98, 12, 22, 18, 78]

One potential approach is to allocate items in a way that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation across all agents is maximized. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 97)
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 91)
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value: 98)
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value: 78)
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 41)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is based on maximizing the value.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
