Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  51   5  58  35
1   1  52   8  80  30
2  58  18  54   5  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences for the items. Here's a step-by-step thought process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Evaluate the Highest Values:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 58.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 80.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 58.

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Values:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (80).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the most (58).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items left are 1, 2, and 4.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest among the remaining, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the next highest (76), assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Finally, assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it (8) over Agent 0 (5).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives items 3 and 2.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

The allocation is fair based on the given valuations, and each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
