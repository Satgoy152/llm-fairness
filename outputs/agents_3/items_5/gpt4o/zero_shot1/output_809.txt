Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  57  36  42  45
1  52  47  25   8  18
2  71  52  75  76  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the five items among the three agents in a way that maximizes the sum of the agents' valuations for their allocated items.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify Potential Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 has a lower valuation overall, but notably considers item 0 and 1 to be valuable compared to their other valuations.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Consider Fair Distribution:**
   - Each agent should receive at least one item to ensure a fair allocation.

3. **Optimize Based on Valuations:**
   - Assign items to agents in a manner that maximizes the sum of their valuations while ensuring fairness.

Let's consider one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 1]
  - This allocation gives agent 0 the items with the highest valuations they have, which are 62 and 57.
- **Agent 1:** Item [3]
  - Assigning item 3 to agent 1 gives them their highest possible valuation of 8.
- **Agent 2:** Items [2, 4]
  - Assigning items 2 and 4 to agent 2 gives them high valuations of 75 and 71.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
