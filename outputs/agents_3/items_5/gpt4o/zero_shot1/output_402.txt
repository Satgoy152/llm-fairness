Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  84  65  19  16
1  34  38  88  80  20
2  26  35  78  80  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's look at the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 and high valuation for item 3.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 3 and moderate valuation for item 4.

Based on these observations, a possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (84 is the highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (88 is the highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (80 is the joint highest valuation for Agent 2).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (55 is the next highest valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (75 is the next highest valuation for Agent 2).

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction as far as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
