Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  64  71  89  20
1  76  29   7  39  21
2  54  32  27  78   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation where each agent's total value is maximized based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List each agent's highest-valued items**:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (89), Item 2 (71), Item 1 (64), Item 0 (48), Item 4 (20)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (76), Item 3 (39), Item 1 (29), Item 4 (21), Item 2 (7)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (78), Item 0 (54), Item 1 (32), Item 2 (27), Item 4 (6)

2. **Allocate the highest priority items to each agent without conflict**:
   - Since agent 0 has the highest value for item 3, and it is also highly valued by agent 2, assign item 3 to agent 0 to satisfy their highest preference.
   - Since agent 1 has the highest value for item 0, and it is also highly valued by agent 0, assign item 0 to agent 1 to satisfy their highest preference.
   - Since agent 2 has item 3 already assigned to agent 0, assign their next highest value, item 0, to agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to avoid conflicts and maximize overall satisfaction**:
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it is their second-highest preference and not highly valued by agents 1 or 2.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it is not highly valued by agents 0 or 1.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it is not claimed yet, and agent 1 places a higher value on it than agent 2.

4. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 1
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 4
   - Agent 2: Item 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
