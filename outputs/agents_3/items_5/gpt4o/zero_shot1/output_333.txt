Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  88  18  75  61
1  35  52  77  44  30
2  15   7  56  79   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we will consider the highest valuation each agent has for the available items and allocate accordingly. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (98) compared to other agents. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2 (77) compared to other agents. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (79) compared to other agents. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. For item 1, agent 0 has a valuation of 88, which is higher than agent 1 and agent 2. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
5. For item 4, agent 0 has a valuation of 61, which is higher than agent 1 and agent 2. Assign item 4 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 5 items fairly based on the agents' valuations.
