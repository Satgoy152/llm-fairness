Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  56  45  49  97
1  97  77  25  95  83
2   9  29  87  88  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 77 25 95 83]
 [ 9 29 87 88 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate all the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [53, 56, 45, 49, 97]
- Agent 1: [97, 77, 25, 95, 83]
- Agent 2: [9, 29, 87, 88, 11]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 97 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 9
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 56
   - Agent 1 values it at 77 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 29
   - Assign to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 87 (highest)
   - Assign to Agent 2

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 95 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 88
   - Assign to Agent 1

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 11
   - Assign to Agent 0

Now let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [2]

This allocation considers which agent values each item the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
