Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  66  62  61  51
1  42  86  38  30  11
2  52  57  36  31  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A fair allocation in this context can be interpreted as giving items to agents such that the total value perceived by each agent is maximized, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 62
  - Item 3: 61
  - Item 4: 51

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 38
  - Item 3: 30
  - Item 4: 11

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 52
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 79

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for this item: 86).
2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item: 79).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item: 62).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for this item: 61, from Agent 0).
5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation for this item: 52, from Agent 2).

With these allocations, we aim to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
