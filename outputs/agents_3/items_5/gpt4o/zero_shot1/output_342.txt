Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  70  62  13   9
1  43  70  75  80  21
2  39  35  37  11  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 43, the highest among agents.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agents 0 and 1 both value it at 70. Let's allocate it to agent 0 to balance the allocation.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 75, the highest among agents.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 80, the highest among agents.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 2 values it at 96, the highest among agents.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Thus, the allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
