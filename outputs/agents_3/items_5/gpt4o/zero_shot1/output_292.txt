Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  77   2  51  53
1  62  28  34  85  36
2  91  43  90  83  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 5 items and 3 agents, it isn't possible to give each agent exactly the same number of items, but we can attempt to distribute them as evenly as possible.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations.** This helps in determining which items are more valuable to each agent.
2. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring no item is double-assigned.**
3. **Try to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.**

Now, let's allocate the items based on their values:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Most valued items: 0 (79), 1 (77), 4 (53)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Most valued items: 3 (85), 0 (62), 4 (36)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Most valued items: 4 (96), 0 (91), 2 (90)

From this analysis, we aim to provide each agent with one of their top choices:

1. **Assign item 0 to Agent 2:** This is their highest value, and Agent 0 and Agent 1 have other high-value items.
2. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0:** This is Agent 0's second-highest value, and neither Agent 1 nor Agent 2 has it as a top choice.
3. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1:** This is Agent 1's highest value item.
4. **Assign item 4 to Agent 2:** This is Agent 2's highest value item after item 0.
5. **Assign item 2 to Agent 0:** This item has almost no value for Agent 0, but it helps balance the distribution.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This distribution attempts to be fair while maximizing the overall valuation satisfaction of each agent.
