Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  31  45  48  91
1  73  79  41   6   2
2  10  43  46  51  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to optimize the allocation so each agent gets items they value highly. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Assign Item 4**: This is the most valuable item across agents. Agent 2 values it the highest with 94.
2. **Assign Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 73, which is the highest among all for this item.
3. **Assign Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 79, which is the highest for this item.
4. **Assign Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 45, which is the highest for this item.
5. **Assign Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 48, which is the highest for this item.

This allocation provides each agent with items they value relatively highly compared to the others.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
