Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  41  90   4  96
1  18  77  39  35  43
2  13  28  34  58  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method such as the "maximizing total valuation" approach, where we try to maximize the total value of items assigned to each agent. However, since each agent should receive an integer number of items and we must allocate all 5 items, let's examine the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [82, 41, 90, 4, 96]
- Agent 1: [18, 77, 39, 35, 43]
- Agent 2: [13, 28, 34, 58, 87]

Let's consider maximizing the total valuation for the group while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 4**: Highest value for Agent 0 (96), allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2**: Second highest value for Agent 0 (90), allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 1 (77), allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 2 (58), allocate to Agent 2.
5. **Item 0**: Remaining item, allocate to Agent 0 (82).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and tries to distribute items to maximize each agent's valuation.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
