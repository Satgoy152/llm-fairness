Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  20   4  88  79
1   4  51  63  19   9
2  97  86  71  21  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. Here's one way to approach this problem using a simple greedy algorithm, where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Confirm that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with 97.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with 86.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with 63.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 88.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 79.

Now, let's check the allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [3, 4].
- Agent 1 gets item [2].
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 1].

Now, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
