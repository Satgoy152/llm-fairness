Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  86  71  17  29
1  25  11  45  86  81
2  48  76   3  77   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [48 76  3 77  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items and 3 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the other two agents will receive 1 item each.

Letâ€™s analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 29

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 4: 81

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 77
  - Item 4: 1

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Give Agent 0 the items they value the most: Item 1 (86) and Item 2 (71).
2. Give Agent 1 the item they value the most: Item 3 (86).
3. Give Agent 2 the items they value the most: Item 0 (48) and Item 4 (1).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to maximize the satisfaction based on their valuations.

### Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
