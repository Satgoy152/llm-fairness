Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  67  78  51  34
1  83  60  80  74  53
2  44  18  24   6  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One common approach is to use a method that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction, known as the "egalitarian" approach. 

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 95, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 80, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 73, so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. For the remaining items (1 and 3), we look at the next highest values:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 67, and Agent 1 values item 1 at 60.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 74, and Agent 0 values item 3 at 51.
   
Based on these observations, we allocate:
- Item 1 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it higher than agent 1).
- Item 3 to agent 1 (since agent 1 values it higher than agent 0).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations and tries to distribute the items fairly among the agents based on their preferences.
