Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  90  18  38  41
1  97  73  13   6  21
2   0  34  58  22  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [64, 90, 18, 38, 41]
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (Value 90)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [97, 73, 13, 6, 21]
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (Value 97)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [0, 34, 58, 22, 72]
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (Value 72)

To ensure a fair allocation, let's proceed with the following assignments based on the highest values:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

Now, allocate the remaining items (2 and 3) to balance the distribution:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 gains a value of 38, which is higher than what Agent 1 and 2 value it)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values Item 2 higher than Agent 0 and Agent 1)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
