Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  14  95  79   4
1  70  54  94   0  82
2   0  14  21  19   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value preferences**: Look at the highest values each agent assigns to items.
2. **Allocate items based on highest preferences**: Assign items to agents based on these preferences, ensuring no item is given to more than one agent and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate and allocate:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2 (95) and 3 (79).
- Agent 1 highly values items 2 (94) and 4 (82).
- Agent 2 does not have high values relative to other agents.

We'll seek to optimize the allocation so that the overall satisfaction (in terms of value) is maximized:

1. **Item 2**: Both agent 0 and agent 1 highly value this item. However, agent 0 values this item slightly more (95 vs. 94), and agent 1 has other high-value items available. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Item 3**: The next highest value for agent 0 is item 3 (79). Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

3. **Item 4**: Agent 1 highly values item 4 (82). Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

4. **Item 0**: Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (70). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

5. **Item 1**: Agent 0 and agent 1 have low interest in item 1. Agent 2 values item 1 slightly more (14). Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

Resulting allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3].
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 4].
- Agent 2 gets item [1].

Here is the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
