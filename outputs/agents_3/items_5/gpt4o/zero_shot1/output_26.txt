Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  16  89  32  95
1  92  72  72  65  58
2  45  89  30  17  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method that tries to optimize the allocation so that each agent gets the items they value most while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than a fair share of the total items, which in this case is about 1 or 2 items per agent, given there are 3 agents and 5 items.

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 85
  - Agent 1 values it at 92
  - Agent 2 values it at 45
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 16
  - Agent 1 values it at 72
  - Agent 2 values it at 89
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 89
  - Agent 1 values it at 72
  - Agent 2 values it at 30
  - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 32
  - Agent 1 values it at 65
  - Agent 2 values it at 17
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 95
  - Agent 1 values it at 58
  - Agent 2 values it at 75
  - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

After considering the above, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value most highly, while also distributing the items fairly among the agents.
