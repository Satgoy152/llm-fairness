Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  86  95  97   0
1  76  73  49  43  20
2  44  97  16  44  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Evaluate the highest values for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 76, and Agent 2 at 44. Highest value: Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 73, and Agent 2 at 97. Highest value: Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 49, and Agent 2 at 16. Highest value: Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 43, and Agent 2 at 44. Highest value: Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 20, and Agent 2 at 48. Highest value: Agent 2.

2. **Allocate items based on highest value preference:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3 (highest values in these items).
   - Agent 1: No highest value items, consider leftover items.
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 4 (highest values in these items).

3. **Check allocation:**
   - Total items allocated: 5 (Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
   - All items are allocated, and no agent is given more than they can handle.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3. Agent 1 receives no items. Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4. This distribution allows each agent to receive items based on their highest valuation for the items, while all items are allocated.
