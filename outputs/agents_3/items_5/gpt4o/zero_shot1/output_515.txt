Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  12  21  83  15
1   0  34  65  74  70
2  52  25  72  57  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction, we can use a simple optimization strategy. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's examine the items one by one:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Agent 2 values it at 52.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value: 90).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 12.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Agent 2 values it at 25.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value: 34).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (highest value: 72).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 83.
   - Agent 1 values it at 74.
   - Agent 2 values it at 57.
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (highest value: 83).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 15.
   - Agent 1 values it at 70.
   - Agent 2 values it at 36.
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (highest value: 70).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
