Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  44  67  56  61
1  61  81  46  95  90
2  57  36  49   7  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the valuations provided, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring an integer allocation of items.

Here's a possible step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1, 3, and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 4, and 2.

To ensure fairness and integer allocation, we can try to assign items based on maximizing each agent's value while ensuring each item is only assigned to one agent.

A possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 81 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 81 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 67 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 95 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 58 for Agent 2).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes the total value fairly based on their preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
