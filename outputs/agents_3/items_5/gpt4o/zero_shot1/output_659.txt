Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  39  67  73  20
1  39  97  89  94  81
2  52  55  86  63  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, since there are 5 items and 3 agents. We'll follow a strategy to ensure fairness by considering the highest preferences of each agent.

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is Item 0 (value 75).
   - Next highest is Item 3 (value 73).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is Item 1 (value 97).
   - Next highest is Item 3, but Agent 0 has already taken it, so Item 2 (value 89).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is Item 2 (value 86), but Agent 1 has taken it.
   - Next highest is Item 3 (value 63), but it is taken by Agent 0.
   - Choose Item 4 (value 18).

Considering the above, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
