Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  16  42  30  58
1   2  52  19  96   6
2  57  11  51  48  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy that aims at maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 96.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 91.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 81.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 2 at 51, which is higher than other agents' valuations for items left.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 1 at 52, which is higher than other agents' valuations for items left.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable value from the items they are allocated. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
