Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   4  99  28  57
1  35  86  72  67  14
2  13  20  64  42  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze each agent's highest-valued items and distribute accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for item 2 (99), item 0 (73), and item 4 (57).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for item 1 (86), item 2 (72), and item 3 (67).
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for item 4 (84), item 2 (64), and item 3 (42).

To balance these preferences and fairly distribute the items:

- Agent 0 should receive item 2, as it is their highest value and also a significant value for others.
- Agent 1 should receive item 1, as it's their highest value and relatively less important to others.
- Agent 2 should receive item 4, as it is their highest value and not as valuable to the others.

Now, considering the remaining items:

- Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0, so allocate it to them.
- Item 3 is a secondary choice for Agent 1, so allocate it to them.

Thus, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
