Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  48  45   6  78
1  30  95  28  93  63
2  62   6   9  95  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent or minimizes the perceived unfairness among agents. One approach is to use the "maximum sum allocation" strategy, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values this at 83, Agent 1 at 30, and Agent 2 at 62. This item goes to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this at 48, Agent 1 at 95, and Agent 2 at 6. This item goes to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this at 45, Agent 1 at 28, and Agent 2 at 9. This item goes to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values this at 6, Agent 1 at 93, and Agent 2 at 95. This item goes to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values this at 78, Agent 1 at 63, and Agent 2 at 82. This item goes to Agent 2.

The allocations based on the above decisions are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them the items they value the most.
