Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  69  84  64   6
1   4  77  66  50  53
2  53  28  81  41  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One strategy is to assign items based on the highest valuation preference for each agent, ensuring each item is only assigned once. We can proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (96), 2 (84), and 1 (69).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (77), 2 (66), and 4 (53).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (81), 0 (53), and 3 (41).

Let's allocate by going through each item and assigning it to the agent that values it the most, while considering the constraints.

- Item 0: Both Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it highly, but Agent 0 has the highest valuation (96). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (77). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (81). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (64). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (53). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now we have assigned all 5 items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are fairly distributed based on relative valuation.
