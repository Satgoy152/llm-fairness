Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  99  62  55  16
1  69   4  30  33  85
2  93  64   1  24  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives by considering their valuations for each item. One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 62, which is the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 55, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 85.

Assigning items based on the highest valuation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.

Now, let's ensure that the allocations are balanced and fair, considering each agent should get an integer number of items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
