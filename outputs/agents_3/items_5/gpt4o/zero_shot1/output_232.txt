Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  49  58  70  61
1  98  54  41  77  98
2  72  85  27  60  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to balance the overall satisfaction. We should also ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as there are three agents and five items.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [14, 49, 58, 70, 61]
   - Highest value items: 3 (70), 4 (61)
   - Tentatively allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [98, 54, 41, 77, 98]
   - Highest value items: 0 (98), 4 (98)
   - Tentatively allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [72, 85, 27, 60, 24]
   - Highest value items: 1 (85), 0 (72)
   - Tentatively allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated three items: 
- Agent 0 has item 3
- Agent 1 has item 0
- Agent 2 has item 1

We need to allocate the remaining two items (2 and 4) fairly:

4. **Remaining items (2 and 4)**:
   - Item 2:
     - Agent 0 value: 58
     - Agent 1 value: 41
     - Agent 2 value: 27
     - Highest value is with Agent 0, allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

   - Item 4:
     - Agent 0 value: 61
     - Agent 1 value: 98
     - Agent 2 value: 24
     - Highest value is with Agent 1, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 1

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
