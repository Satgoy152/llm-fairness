Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15   5  82  17  89
1  36  26  55  36  17
2   3  84  39  44  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent. One method to achieve a fair allocation is to use a greedy approach, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **List each item's valuations across all agents:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 36, Agent 2 at 3.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 26, Agent 2 at 84.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 55, Agent 2 at 39.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 at 36, Agent 2 at 44.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 at 17, Agent 2 at 20.

2. **Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 36.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 44.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.

3. **Resulting allocations:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [2, 4].
   - Agent 1 gets item [0].
   - Agent 2 gets items [1, 3].

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
