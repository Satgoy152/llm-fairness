Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  30  40  81  62
1  45  17  75  65  93
2  25  45  96   3  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair distribution of items. Here's one way to approach this problem: 

1. Evaluate the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for all agents.

2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while trying to maximize the total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 81) and item 4 (value 62).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 75).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 25) and item 1 (value 45).

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
