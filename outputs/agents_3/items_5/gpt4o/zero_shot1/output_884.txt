Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  17  29  62  15
1  75  33  42  60  14
2   1  78  75  96   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no items are left unallocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation for agent 0 is item 0 (valuation of 85).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation for agent 1 is item 0 (valuation of 75), but since item 0 is already allocated, we look at the next highest, which is item 3 (valuation of 60).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation for agent 2 is item 3 (valuation of 96), but since item 3 is already allocated, we look at the next highest, which is item 1 (valuation of 78).

Now, we have items 0, 1, and 3 allocated. We need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 4.

4. **Agent 0:**
   - Next highest available item for agent 0 is item 3 (valuation of 62), but since it's already allocated, we look at item 2 (valuation of 29).

5. **Agent 1:**
   - Next highest available item for agent 1 is item 2 (valuation of 42), but since it's already allocated, we look at item 4 (valuation of 14).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
