Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  49  78  72  17
1  20  95  80  44  97
2  86  71  43  29  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that every item is allocated to one agent, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [56, 49, 78, 72, 17]
   - Total valuation if allocated: 
     - (0, 1): 56 + 49 = 105
     - (0, 2): 56 + 78 = 134
     - (2, 3): 78 + 72 = 150 (highest combination for 2 items)
     - (0, 3): 56 + 72 = 128
     - (0, 4): 56 + 17 = 73
     - (3, 4): 72 + 17 = 89

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [20, 95, 80, 44, 97]
   - Total valuation if allocated:
     - (1, 4): 95 + 97 = 192 (highest combination for 2 items)
     - (1, 2): 95 + 80 = 175
     - (2, 4): 80 + 97 = 177
     - (3, 4): 44 + 97 = 141

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [86, 71, 43, 29, 71]
   - Total valuation if allocated:
     - (0, 1): 86 + 71 = 157
     - (1, 4): 71 + 71 = 142
     - (0, 4): 86 + 71 = 157
     - (1, 3): 71 + 29 = 100

Considering these values, a potential fair allocation is:

- Give items 2 and 3 to Agent 0, as this provides a total of 150.
- Give items 1 and 4 to Agent 1, as this provides a total of 192.
- Give item 0 to Agent 2, as this provides a value of 86.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
