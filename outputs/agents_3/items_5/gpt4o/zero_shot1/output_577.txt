Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  66  11  20  46
1   8  94  84  77   9
2  70  16  30  10  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction, we can use a simple strategy of assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 70 (highest)
   - **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2**

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 66
   - Agent 1 values it at 94 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 30
   - **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 20
   - Agent 1 values it at 77 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Agent 2 values it at 67 (highest)
   - **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2** (since Agent 2 has fewer items so far)

Now, let's present the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all items distributed among the agents.
