Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  97  21  61  70
1  50   1   5  76  96
2  67  84  34  54  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 67.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 34.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 76.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Receives a Fair Number of Items:**
   - Agent 0 receives Item 1.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 2.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while considering their preferences.
