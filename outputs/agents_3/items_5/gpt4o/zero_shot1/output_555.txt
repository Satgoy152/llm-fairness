Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  12  54  70   4
1  74  94  12  38  15
2  68  97  77  11  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  12  54  70   4
1  74  94  12  38  15
2  68  97  77  11  23
```

A possible approach to fairly allocate these items is to ensure that each agent gets items that are highly valued by them compared to other agents. Let's look at each item and decide:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 11
  - Agent 1 values it at 74
  - Agent 2 values it at 68
  - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest valuation).

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 12
  - Agent 1 values it at 94
  - Agent 2 values it at 97
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 54
  - Agent 1 values it at 12
  - Agent 2 values it at 77
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 70
  - Agent 1 values it at 38
  - Agent 2 values it at 11
  - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest valuation).

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 4
  - Agent 1 values it at 15
  - Agent 2 values it at 23
  - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest valuation).

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 4.

Here's how the allocations look in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
