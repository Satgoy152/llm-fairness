Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  40  80  41  63
1  35  64  30  50  45
2  91  59  51  10   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize fairness in the distribution. Here's one possible allocation approach, considering maximizing each agent's value:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3. However, to distribute items fairly, we can allocate item 3 to Agent 0, which has a value of 41 for this agent.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 1, adding significant value for this agent.
   - Agent 1 also has a reasonable valuation for item 4, so we can allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0, so we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 has a decent valuation for item 2, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a valuable item according to their preferences.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, ensuring all 5 items are distributed.
