Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  36  15  43  59
1  83  22   7  34  27
2  14  28  35  68  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest valued items. Let's follow a strategy where each agent receives at least one item and the allocation maximizes the total value across all items.

Here are the steps for a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 70).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 83), but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest value is item 1 (value 22).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 68).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2 and 4):

4. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 15, Agent 1 values it at 7, and Agent 2 at 35.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 59, Agent 1 values it at 27, and Agent 2 at 58.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
