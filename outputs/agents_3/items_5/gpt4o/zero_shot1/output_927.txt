Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  21  16  21  36
1  89  35  62  61  35
2  46  91  42  52  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. A possible approach is to consider the highest value each agent assigns to any item and allocate accordingly, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's start by examining the valuations each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0 values: [11, 21, 16, 21, 36]
- Agent 1 values: [89, 35, 62, 61, 35]
- Agent 2 values: [46, 91, 42, 52, 15]

Based on the highest values for each item:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest (89)
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest (91)
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest (62)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it highest (61)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest (36)

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value at 89)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value at 91)
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value at 36)
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value at 62)
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest remaining value at 21)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
