Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  54  47  81  20
1  39   1  61  67  99
2   0  21  45  87  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (81), so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 0 (77), so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 (99), so we assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 has the next highest value for item 2 (61), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The remaining item, item 1, is assigned to Agent 2. Agent 2 has a valuation of 21 for this item, which is the highest among unassigned items for them.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
