Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  37  42  37  29
1   0  31  27  70  56
2  87  66  78  61  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 31 27 70 56]
 [87 66 78 61 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that prioritizes allocations based on each agent's highest valuation.

Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [77, 37, 42, 37, 29]
Agent 1: [0, 31, 27, 70, 56]
Agent 2: [87, 66, 78, 61, 72]
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest overall valuation for any item (87 for item 0), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for an unallocated item (70 for item 3), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. Now, for the remaining items, Agent 2 has the highest unclaimed valuation (78 for item 2), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Among the remaining items, Agent 2 has the highest valuation again (72 for item 4), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

5. The last remaining item is item 1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (66), but since Agent 2 already has 3 items, let's consider the other agents. Agent 0 values item 1 at 37, and Agent 1 values it at 31. Hence, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

Agent 0: [1]  
Agent 1: [3]  
Agent 2: [0, 2, 4]  

Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
