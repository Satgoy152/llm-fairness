Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  60  43  73  67
1  80  50  18  10  58
2  17  88  67  56   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [17 88 67 56  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to allocate based on the highest value preference each agent has for the items.

Let's evaluate the agent preferences:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 87 (item 0), 60 (item 1), 43 (item 2), 73 (item 3), 67 (item 4).
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 80 (item 0), 50 (item 1), 18 (item 2), 10 (item 3), 58 (item 4).
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 17 (item 0), 88 (item 1), 67 (item 2), 56 (item 3), 6 (item 4).

Let's allocate the items to maximize the overall satisfaction:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (88), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 0 (87), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (73), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 2 (67), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
5. Finally, item 4 can be assigned to Agent 1, as it has a decent valuation of 58 compared to other items for Agent 1.

Now, let's write the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
