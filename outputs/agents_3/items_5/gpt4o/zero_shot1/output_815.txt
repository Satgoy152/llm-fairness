Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68   8  22  80  25
1  43  65  25  80  86
2  87  49  59   5  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent. Here's a possible allocation that considers the values each agent places on the items:

1. Start by examining which items have a clear preference by one agent over the others.
2. Assign those items to the respective agents.
3. Balance the remaining items by checking the next highest preferences.

Let's break down the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 87, compared to Agent 0's 68 and Agent 1's 43.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 65, compared to Agent 2's 49 and Agent 0's 8.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 59, compared to Agent 0's 22 and Agent 1's 25.
- **Item 3**: Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value this item the highest at 80. However, to balance the allocations and since Agent 0 values fewer high-value items overall, assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 89, compared to Agent 1's 86 and Agent 0's 25.

Thus, an allocation that maximizes individual agent satisfaction could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and the total number of allocated items is 5.
