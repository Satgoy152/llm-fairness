Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  80   1  48  62
1   9  85  10  87  98
2  28   3   0   1  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the constraints, we'll try to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations is balanced across the agents. Let's evaluate the possibilities:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
3. Agent 2 has relatively lower valuations across the board but should still receive at least one item.

Here's a potential allocation that seeks to maximize fairness:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 3).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 4).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (the least valued item overall).

Thus, a fair allocation of the items could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, maximizes the total valuations for agents, and keeps the distribution relatively balanced.
