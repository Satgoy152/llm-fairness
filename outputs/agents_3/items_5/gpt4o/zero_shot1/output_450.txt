Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  13  25  73  37
1  69  13  17  61  18
2  30  32  39  24  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [30 32 39 24 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total utility of the allocation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and try to find a fair allocation:

**Agent Valuations:**

- Agent 0: [99, 13, 25, 73, 37]
- Agent 1: [69, 13, 17, 61, 18]
- Agent 2: [30, 32, 39, 24, 14]

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (99), and item 3 (73).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (69) but less than Agent 0, and item 3 (61).
3. **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations across all items, with the highest being item 2 (39).

To maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Assign item 0 to **Agent 0** because they value it the highest.
- Assign item 3 to **Agent 0** as well, as they value it the highest and it's their second most valuable item.
- Assign item 2 to **Agent 2** because it's their highest-valued item.
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 2** because they value it more than item 4 and it balances the allocations.
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 1** as they value it more than item 1.

**Resulting Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2]

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
