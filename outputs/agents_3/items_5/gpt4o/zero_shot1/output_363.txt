Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  80  96  58  82
1  55  92  50  85  21
2   7  40  72  83  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total allocation matches the number of items available.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [98, 80, 96, 58, 82]
- Agent 1: [55, 92, 50, 85, 21]
- Agent 2: [7, 40, 72, 83, 30]

A balanced allocation could be achieved by examining the highest valuations for each agent and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item they value highly. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 3.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 but it is not their highest, so we'll consider giving them item 4 to balance the allocation.

Considering the above points and ensuring a fair distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the overall distribution is balanced based on the given valuations.
