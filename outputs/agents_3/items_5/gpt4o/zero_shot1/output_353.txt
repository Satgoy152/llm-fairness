Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  44  33  68  43
1  38  19  61  48  75
2  14  76  57   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (68), Item 0 (67)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (75), Item 2 (61)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (91), Item 1 (76)
   - Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2

4. **Remaining items**: 
   - Items 2 and 3 are left.
   - Assess remaining values for Items 2 and 3:
     - Agent 0: Item 2 (33), Item 3 (68)
     - Agent 1: Item 2 (61), Item 3 (48)
     - Agent 2: Item 2 (57), Item 3 (0)

5. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 61, highest available)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 68, highest available)

Now, we have allocated all the items. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
