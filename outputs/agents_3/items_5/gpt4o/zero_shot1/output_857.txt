Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  87  55  16  59
1  99  11  98  78   8
2  54  55  11  31  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we should ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation maximizes the overall satisfaction or value for each agent. One approach is to look at the highest valuations and allocate items to agents based on these preferences, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the values provided:

- Agent 0: [30, 87, 55, 16, 59]
- Agent 1: [99, 11, 98, 78, 8]
- Agent 2: [54, 55, 11, 31, 51]

We can allocate items as follows:

1. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. Agent 1 also values item 2 at 98. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 87. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
4. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 51. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
5. For item 3, agent 1 has a relatively high valuation of 78 compared to the others. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation considers high valuations and distributes items fairly among agents. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
