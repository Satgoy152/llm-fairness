Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  28  42  43  90
1  34  46  67   9  30
2  75  66  90  67  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider various methods like maximizing total satisfaction or ensuring an equitable distribution based on preferences. Let's try to allocate items so that the overall satisfaction is balanced across agents by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the remaining items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (value 98).
2. Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (value 90).
3. Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 90).
4. Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (value 66).
5. Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (value 9).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 1.
