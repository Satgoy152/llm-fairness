Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   1  30  58   6
1  92  18  25  52  80
2   9  77  70  93  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 9 77 70 93 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on the valuations given. This is a basic assignment problem. Here, we'll use a simple approach to allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations each agent has for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   1  30  58   6
1  92  18  25  52  80
2   9  77  70  93  85
```

Let's break down the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 77.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 70.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest at 85.

Now, we see that Agent 2 values several items the highest, but we must ensure each agent gets some items fairly if possible. However, given the constraints, we also need to ensure all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation considering the valuations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Item 0).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Item 1).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Item 3).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Item 4 after Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and attempts to distribute items fairly, even if not all agents receive items:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the valuations while ensuring all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
