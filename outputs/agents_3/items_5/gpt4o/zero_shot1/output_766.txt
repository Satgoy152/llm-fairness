Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  23   5  31  48
1  32   7   9  91  67
2  97  89  36  52  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [97 89 36 52 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We will employ a greedy approach to allocate items such that the sum of the valuations is maximized for each agent. Let's go through the allocation process.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is 67 for item 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is 91 for item 3.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is 97 for item 0, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest value is 89 for item 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining items**: 2, 4

5. **Agent 0's next highest available value**:
   - Item 4 with value 48.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 1's next highest available value**:
   - Item 2 with value 9.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Now we have allocated all 5 items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

Each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
