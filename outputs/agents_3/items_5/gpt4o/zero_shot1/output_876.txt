Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  30  79  36  95
1  17  94  88  11   3
2  20  15  31  72  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 95. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 at 79. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 94. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Next highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 2 at 88, but it's already assigned to Agent 0. The next available highest valued item is item 0 at 17. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 72. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 4 and 2.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 0.
- Agent 2 has item 3.

This allocation satisfies that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 5.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```
