Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  37  43  90  14
1  14  75  98  98  55
2  66  62  18  38   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives by considering their preferences. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [24, 37, 43, 90, 14]
- Agent 1: [14, 75, 98, 98, 55]
- Agent 2: [66, 62, 18, 38, 0]

A possible strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's perform this allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 66.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 75.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 55.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated fairly, and each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

This distribution ensures that each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
