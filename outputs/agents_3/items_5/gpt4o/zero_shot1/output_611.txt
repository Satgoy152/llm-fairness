Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  80  26  90  92
1  48  58  25  19   4
2  87  82  47  85  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine each item and allocate it accordingly:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 87
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 80
   - Agent 1 values it at 58
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 47
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 85
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 43
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
