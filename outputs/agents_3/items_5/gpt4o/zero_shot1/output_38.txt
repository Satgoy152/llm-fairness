Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  72  13  20  37
1  80  34  43  16  46
2   4  11  53  81  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 4 11 53 81 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 20
  - Item 4: 37

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 46

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 23

Let's try to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is for Agent 1 (value 80).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: Highest value is for Agent 0 (value 72).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: Highest value is for Agent 2 (value 53).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: Highest value is for Agent 2 (value 81).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: Highest value is for Agent 1 (value 46).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
