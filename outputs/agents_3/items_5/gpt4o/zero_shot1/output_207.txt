Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  54  84  56  39
1  50  24  79  56   8
2  14  61  79  61   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [14 61 79 61  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. This is a simplified version of a combinatorial auction problem or a variant of the assignment problem.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [60, 54, 84, 56, 39]
- Agent 1 values: [50, 24, 79, 56, 8]
- Agent 2 values: [14, 61, 79, 61, 2]

We aim to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible:

1. Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 0 (60).
2. Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (61).
3. Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (84).
4. Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 2 (61).
5. Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 0 (39).

To balance the allocations, let's adjust for a fair distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (to ensure each agent gets at least one item).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

With these allocations, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is five.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
