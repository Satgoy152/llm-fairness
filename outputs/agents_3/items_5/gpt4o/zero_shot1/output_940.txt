Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  41  46   2  51
1  74  35  27   4  56
2  21  64  50  34  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 35 27  4 56]
 [21 64 50 34 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start by examining the valuations:
   - Agent 0: [26, 41, 46, 2, 51]
   - Agent 1: [74, 35, 27, 4, 56]
   - Agent 2: [21, 64, 50, 34, 75]

2. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 74.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 64.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 46.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 34, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 4.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.

3. Therefore, the allocation is:
   - Agent 0 receives item 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0.
   - Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

In JSON format, the allocation looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
