Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  97  14   1  32
1  30  48  15  72  20
2  34  99  62  78  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 25
   - Item 1: 97
   - Item 2: 14
   - Item 3: 1
   - Item 4: 32

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 30
   - Item 1: 48
   - Item 2: 15
   - Item 3: 72
   - Item 4: 20

3. **Agent 2 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 34
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 2: 62
   - Item 3: 78
   - Item 4: 90

By reviewing the valuations, we try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 34.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 62.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.

From the above, it seems like Agent 2 values most items highly. However, to fairly distribute items, we can make some adjustments to ensure other agents receive items as well:

- **Assign Item 0** to Agent 2.
- **Assign Item 1** to Agent 0 (next highest after Agent 2).
- **Assign Item 2** to Agent 1 (next highest after Agent 2).
- **Assign Item 3** to Agent 1.
- **Assign Item 4** to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
