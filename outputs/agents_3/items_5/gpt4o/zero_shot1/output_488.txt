Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  91  81  60   3
1  62  33   0  52  81
2  79  36  77  29   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation based on the preferences of each agent. Here is a potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued items for Agent 0 are items 1, 2, and 0, in that order. However, to ensure fairness and integer allocation, we will start by assigning the highest available item and proceed from there.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the highest, followed by items 0 and 3. We should consider giving Agent 1 item 4 first, then check for remaining high-value allocations.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the highest, followed by items 2 and 1. We should consider giving Agent 2 item 0 first, then check for remaining high-value allocations.

After examining the valuations and to ensure a fair distribution:

- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 0**.
- Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 1**.
- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 2**.

Now, we have two items left: 2 and 3. We can allocate them as follows to maximize the overall fairness and valuation:

- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 0** (since it's highly valued by Agent 0).
- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 1** (since it's highly valued by Agent 1 compared to Agent 2).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value derived from the allocation is maximized given the constraints.
