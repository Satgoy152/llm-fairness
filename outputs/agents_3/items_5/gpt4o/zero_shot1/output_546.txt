Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  46  16  38  43
1  85  34  77  73  94
2  95  40  91  62  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable value according to their preferences. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs, but given the small size of this problem, we can proceed with a simpler heuristic approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [12, 46, 16, 38, 43]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [85, 34, 77, 73, 94]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [95, 40, 91, 62, 52]

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (94) and item 0 (85), so let's assign those to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (91), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 has a relatively high value for item 1 (46), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- For the last item (3), Agent 2 has a reasonable value (62), so assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
