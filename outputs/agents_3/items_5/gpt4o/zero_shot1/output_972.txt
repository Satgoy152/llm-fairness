Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  45  67  72  52
1  98  41  85  67  55
2   9  58  39   3  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest (72), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (98), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (58), so we assign item 1 to agent 2.

Now, we have assigned three items (0, 1, 3), leaving items 2 and 4 unallocated. We'll allocate these based on remaining valuations:

4. **Item 2**: The highest remaining valuation for item 2 is by Agent 0 (67), so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest remaining valuation for item 4 is by Agent 1 (55), so we assign item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
