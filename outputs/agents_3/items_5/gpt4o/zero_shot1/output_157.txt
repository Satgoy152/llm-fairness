Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  40  21  61  95
1  43  66  96  20  49
2   3  10  78  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for an allocation strategy that maximizes the total value perceived by the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items and 3 agents, each agent may not receive the same number of items, but we can try to distribute them to maximize satisfaction.

Let's consider the valuation matrix:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 38 | 40 | 21 | 61 | 95 |
| 1          | 43 | 66 | 96 | 20 | 49 |
| 2          | 3  | 10 | 78 | 59 | 55 |

We can prioritize the allocation of items based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item, ensuring each item is allocated only once and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (96), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (95), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (78), but it's already allocated to Agent 1. Next highest valued item is item 3 (59), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Now we have items 0 and 1 left. Agent 1 values item 1 the next highest (66), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
5. Finally, item 0 is left, which Agent 1 values at 43, higher than any other agent, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their highest preferences. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
