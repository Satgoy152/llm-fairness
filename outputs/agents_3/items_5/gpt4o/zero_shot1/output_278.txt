Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  88  55  48  87
1   8  60  28  91  75
2   5  82  82  17  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while maximizing the total value, we can use a method that considers each agent's highest valued items. Below is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's benefit:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (88), Item 4 (87)

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (91), Item 4 (75)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (82), Item 2 (82)

Now, we will allocate items to maximize each agent's preferences:

- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest (91).
  
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (88), and Agent 2 values it equally to another item (82), so Agent 0 gets priority here.

- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0's second-highest value is Item 4 (87).

- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2:** It's one of the highest values for Agent 2 (82), and is not the highest for others.

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:** Remaining item, and Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2.

This results in a fair allocation where each agent gets items that provide them significant value. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
