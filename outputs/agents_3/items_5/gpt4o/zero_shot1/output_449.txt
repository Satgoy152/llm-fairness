Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53   4  61  59  75
1  90  13   5  47  61
2  41  14  39  19  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53  4 61 59 75]
 [90 13  5 47 61]
 [41 14 39 19 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [53, 4, 61, 59, 75]
- Agent 1: [90, 13, 5, 47, 61]
- Agent 2: [41, 14, 39, 19, 91]

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 90).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 14).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 61).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 59).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 91).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and assigns all items. The agents receive items where they have relatively high valuations, and the overall allocation is balanced.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
