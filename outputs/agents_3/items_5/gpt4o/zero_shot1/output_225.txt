Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  12  17   7  53
1  48  90  71  93  19
2  43  97  38  57  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We also want to ensure that all 5 items are allocated. Let's analyze the table:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 80
- Item 1: 12
- Item 2: 17
- Item 3: 7
- Item 4: 53

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 71
- Item 3: 93
- Item 4: 19

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 43
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 38
- Item 3: 57
- Item 4: 23

Let's assign the items by considering the highest values for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 80, which is the highest among the agents.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 97, which is the highest among the agents.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 71, which is the highest among the agents.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest among the agents.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 53, which is the highest among the agents.

Based on these values, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
