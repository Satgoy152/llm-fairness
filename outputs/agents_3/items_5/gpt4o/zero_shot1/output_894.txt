Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  98  16  80  41
1  30  70  48  69   6
2  81  49  76  51   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 70 48 69  6]
 [81 49 76 51  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A good strategy is to maximize the total value across all agents.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [19, 98, 16, 80, 41]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [30, 70, 48, 69, 6]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [81, 49, 76, 51, 0]

Considering the highest valuations for each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 81.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 76.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 80.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 41, but Agent 1 values it at 6, which is less.

Based on these valuations, a possible fair allocation to maximize total utility could be:

- Give item 0 to agent 2.
- Give item 1 to agent 0.
- Give item 2 to agent 2.
- Give item 3 to agent 0.
- Give item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation maximizes the total value:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3 (total value = 98 + 80 = 178)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (total value = 6)
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2 (total value = 81 + 76 = 157)

Now, I will present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
