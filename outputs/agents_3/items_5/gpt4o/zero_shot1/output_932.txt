Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  21  63  67  33
1  71  56  65  73   6
2  98  49  27  52  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [71 56 65 73  6]
 [98 49 27 52 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to assign the items such that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all 5 items are distributed.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0: [72, 21, 63, 67, 33]
- Agent 1: [71, 56, 65, 73, 6]
- Agent 2: [98, 49, 27, 52, 93]

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives a fair share if possible. 

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (56).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (65).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (73).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (93).

Now let's allocate based on these valuations:

- Agent 2 will receive Item 0 and Item 4.
- Agent 1 will receive Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3.
- Agent 0 will receive no items as they do not have the highest valuation for any item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
