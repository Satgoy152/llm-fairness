Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  20  31  54  29
1  95  23  62  16  64
2  49  38  51  55  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to the agents based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the items for each agent and allocate them to maximize their satisfaction:

1. Agent 0:
   - Valuations: 31, 20, 31, 54, 29

2. Agent 1:
   - Valuations: 95, 23, 62, 16, 64

3. Agent 2:
   - Valuations: 49, 38, 51, 55, 26

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Start by assigning the item with the highest value to each agent, ensuring no item is double-assigned. 
- After one round, if there are remaining items, continue assigning based on the next highest unallocated item value.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**
1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation:
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (value: 95)
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value: 55)
   - Agent 0 gets item 3 (value: 54)
   - Since item 3 is already assigned to Agent 2, we skip this and assign Agent 0 item 2 (value: 31)

2. Check remaining items: 1, 4
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value: 64)
   - Agent 2 gets item 1 (value: 38)

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations, while each agent receives at least one item.
