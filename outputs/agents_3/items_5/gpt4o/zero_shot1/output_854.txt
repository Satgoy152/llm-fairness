Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  88  26  89  41
1   8  69  33  64  51
2  36  19  99  10  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, keeping in mind that each agent can receive an integer number of items. Here's a way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:** Look at the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate those first to maximize fairness based on each agent's preferences.

2. **Ensure all items are allocated:** We have to allocate all 5 items, so some compromises may be necessary to ensure all items are distributed.

3. **Balance total valuation:** Try to balance the total value each agent receives to achieve fairness.

Let's go through the table:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (89), followed by item 1 (88).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (69), followed by item 4 (51).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (99), followed by item 4 (97).

Based on this, one possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 4]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 37 + 88 = 125
- Agent 1: 64
- Agent 2: 99 + 97 = 196

This distribution attempts to balance the total value among agents, given the constraints.

Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
