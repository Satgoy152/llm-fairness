Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  78  95  41  58
1  37  64  20   6  34
2  33  17  33  77  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing total utility or ensuring that each agent gets at least one item that they value highly. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Analyze the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values items: 0 (22), 1 (78), 2 (95), 3 (41), 4 (58)
   - Agent 1 values items: 0 (37), 1 (64), 2 (20), 3 (6), 4 (34)
   - Agent 2 values items: 0 (33), 1 (17), 2 (33), 3 (77), 4 (99)

2. **Assign Highest Valued Items:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value is item 2 (95)
   - Agent 1: Highest value is item 1 (64)
   - Agent 2: Highest value is item 4 (99)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Now we need to allocate items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 0: Next highest value is item 1 (78), but itâ€™s already taken. Next is item 4 (58).
   - Agent 1: Next highest value is item 0 (37).
   - Agent 2: Next highest value is item 3 (77).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets item 0.
   - Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and all items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
