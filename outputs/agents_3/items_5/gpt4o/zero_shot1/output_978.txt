Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  56  75  60   1
1  31  85  26  96  23
2  11  59  37   6  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Evaluate the value each agent assigns to each item.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize the total utility for each agent.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (value of 95).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (value of 96).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (value of 91).

These initial allocations are based on the highest individual valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

This leaves us with items 1 and 2 to allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (value of 75).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (value of 85).
- Agent 2 values item 1 moderately (value of 59) and item 2 moderately (value of 37).

Considering the remaining high valuations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation of 85.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation of 75.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize the value based on their preferences.
