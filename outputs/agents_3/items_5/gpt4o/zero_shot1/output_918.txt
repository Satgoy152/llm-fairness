Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  43  60  57  36
1  52  49   5  14  96
2  40  25  34  80  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 49  5 14 96]
 [40 25 34 80 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will try to distribute the items so that each agent receives the items they value the most, as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [10, 43, 60, 57, 36]
Agent 1: [52, 49,  5, 14, 96]
Agent 2: [40, 25, 34, 80, 54]
```

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 2 (value = 60)
   - Second-highest value is for item 3 (value = 57)
   - We assign item 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is for item 4 (value = 96)
   - Second-highest value is for item 0 (value = 52)
   - We assign item 4 to Agent 1 (since item 0 is not yet assigned, we can consider it for Agent 2 if it increases overall satisfaction).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (value = 80), but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Second-highest value is for item 4 (value = 54), but it's already taken by Agent 1.
   - Next highest value available is for item 0 (value = 40).
   - We assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. Since Agent 1 has only one item and Agents 0 and 2 have two items, we check the remaining items:
   - Item 1 is left unassigned. Agent 1 values item 1 at 49, which is the highest available value.
   - We assign item 1 to Agent 1.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
