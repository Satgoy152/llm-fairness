Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  34  77  16  23
1  98  54  13  20  32
2  85  25  41  80  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Each agent can receive 0, 1, or more items, but the total number of allocated items should be 5.

Here's a potential allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 but also values item 1 reasonably.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.

Based on these observations, an allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (valued at 77).
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (valued at 98) and item 1 (valued at 54).
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4 (valued at 80 and 88).

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations for specific items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
