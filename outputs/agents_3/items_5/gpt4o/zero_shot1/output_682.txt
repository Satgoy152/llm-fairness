Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  89  18  29  33
1  43  13   6  73  30
2  65  77  41  13  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, assuming that is part of the fairness criteria. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 0: 60
   - Item 1: 89
   - Item 2: 18
   - Item 3: 29
   - Item 4: 33

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 0: 43
   - Item 1: 13
   - Item 2: 6
   - Item 3: 73
   - Item 4: 30

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Item 0: 65
   - Item 1: 77
   - Item 2: 41
   - Item 3: 13
   - Item 4: 92

### Allocation Strategy:
- First, allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations.
- Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 73)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 92)
- The remaining items 0 and 2 can be allocated to maximize total value.

### Remaining Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 60)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 41)

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and balances the total value received by each agent.
