Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  39  49  83  87
1   4  27  54  65  27
2  39  86  61  21  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 27 54 65 27]
 [39 86 61 21 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We will start by analyzing the valuations and then allocate the items.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent \ Item  0   1   2   3   4
0          14  39  49  83  87
1           4  27  54  65  27
2          39  86  61  21  37
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this the most at 87.
2. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this the most at 83.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this the most at 86.
4. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this the most at 54.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this the most at 39.

After assigning these items based on highest valuations, we get the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
