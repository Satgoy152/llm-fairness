Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  57  64  61  76
1  33  69  86  74  92
2  66  99  23  53  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's values: [8, 57, 64, 61, 76]
- Agent 1's values: [33, 69, 86, 74, 92]
- Agent 2's values: [66, 99, 23, 53, 22]

To allocate fairly, we could use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's total value by choosing items they value most. Here's one way to allocate:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 4 have relatively high values (61 and 76).
2. **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 4 have high values (86 and 92), but since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can choose item 2 and the next highest, item 1 (69).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest remaining value is item 0 (66).

Now, let's allocate based on these choices:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 1
- Agent 2: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all 5 items are allocated fairly based on the valuations.
