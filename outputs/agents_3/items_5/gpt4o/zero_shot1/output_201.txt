Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98   7  45  19  83
1  72  64  25  41  27
2  71  89  86  86  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 64 25 41 27]
 [71 89 86 86 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations in the table, one approach is to consider the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Let's examine the potential allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3.

One possible allocation could be:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 83).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 89).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 86).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 41).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

Therefore, the allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, while also maximizing the total value based on the given valuations.
