Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  95  10  17  32
1  94  50  14  51  26
2  99  81  93   9  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the preferences of each agent. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Evaluate the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly (99).

2. **Assign the most valued item to each agent if possible:**
   - Item 0 is highly valued by both Agent 1 and Agent 2, but Agent 2 has the highest valuation for it (99). Therefore, assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (95), assign item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Assign remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction:**
   - Agent 1 should get an item that Agent 0 and Agent 2 don't value as much, so assign item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it significantly (51).
   - Agent 0 can take item 4 as Agent 2 and Agent 1 value it less, and it improves the overall balance (Agent 0 values it at 32).
   - The remaining item 2 should go to Agent 2 as they value it the most (93).

4. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
