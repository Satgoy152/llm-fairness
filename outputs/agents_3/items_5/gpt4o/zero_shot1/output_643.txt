Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  54  32  43  30
1  67  25   1  82  95
2  13  45  64  77  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while making sure each agent gets a whole number of items and all items are distributed.

One possible fair allocation approach is to give each agent the item they value the most, as long as it doesn't interfere with other allocations. Here's how we can allocate:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 3.

At this point, items 0, 3, and 4 are allocated. We need to allocate items 1 and 2:

4. **Agent 2** has the next highest value for item 2.
5. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for item 1.

Let's compile this into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
