Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  66  41  49  48
1  64  55  64  99  95
2  60  89  98  62  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [64 55 64 99 95]
 [60 89 98 62 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that provide relatively higher value compared to other agents.
- Agent 1: Allocate items that are valued highest according to their preferences.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that maximize their total value.

Based on the given valuations, we can calculate and assign the items:

1. For Agent 0, we assign item 0 (value 38) and item 3 (value 49).
2. For Agent 1, we assign item 4 (value 95).
3. For Agent 2, we assign item 1 (value 89) and item 2 (value 98).

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 5.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
