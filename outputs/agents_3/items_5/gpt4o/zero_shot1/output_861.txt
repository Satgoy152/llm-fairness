Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65   4  29  47  90
1  86  93  44  17  57
2  22  52  45  42  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65  4 29 47 90]
 [86 93 44 17 57]
 [22 52 45 42 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. 

Let's look at the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values: [65, 4, 29, 47, 90]
- Agent 1 values: [86, 93, 44, 17, 57]
- Agent 2 values: [22, 52, 45, 42, 11]

We can try to allocate the highest valued items to each agent where possible, while considering overall balance:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: 90 (Item 4)
   - Second highest: 65 (Item 0)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: 93 (Item 1)
   - Second highest: 86 (Item 0)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: 52 (Item 1)
   - Second highest: 45 (Item 2)

Given the above, it seems that item 1 and item 0 are valued highly by Agents 1 and 2 respectively. To balance, let's allocate based on each agent receiving their highest valued available item:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, for the remaining items (0, 3), we should try to balance the allocation further:

- Agent 0 can get item 0 (second priority for Agent 1 but first for Agent 0)
- Agent 1 can get item 3 (next best available for Agent 1)

After the allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 4 and 0.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has item 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
