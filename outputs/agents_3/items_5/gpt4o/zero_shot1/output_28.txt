Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72   8  87  42  85
1   2  39  15  84  76
2  44  81  38  11  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [44 81 38 11 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 72, 8, 87, 42, 85.
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 2, 39, 15, 84, 76.
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 44, 81, 38, 11, 30.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2 (Highest Value: 87)** - Allocated to Agent 0
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 87 for item 2.

2. **Item 0 (Next Highest Value: 72)** - Allocated to Agent 0
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 72 for item 0.

3. **Item 3 (Next Highest Value: 84)** - Allocated to Agent 1
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 84 for item 3.

4. **Item 1 (Next Highest Value: 81)** - Allocated to Agent 2
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 81 for item 1.

5. **Item 4 (Next Highest Value: 85)** - Allocated to Agent 0
   - Agent 0 has the second highest valuation of 85 for item 4, but it balances the total distribution fairly since Agent 0 already has two items, and this allocation maximizes the overall valuation.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed fairly.
