Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  69  38   3  64
1  62   2  14  21  54
2  17  67  99  34   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their valuations, we need to consider how each item is valued by each agent. The goal is to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations for each item by each agent**:
    - Item 0: [91, 62, 17]
    - Item 1: [69, 2, 67]
    - Item 2: [38, 14, 99]
    - Item 3: [3, 21, 34]
    - Item 4: [64, 54, 2]

2. **Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items**:
    - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
    - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
    - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
    - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 21.
    - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 64.

3. **Check balance**:
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 4
    - Agent 1: Item 3
    - Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation gives each agent a set of items, ensuring the highest possible valuations while distributing the items fairly.

4. **Present the allocations in JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items based on their highest valuations while keeping the distribution fair and integer.
