Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  11  88  15   2
1  49  45  95  56  18
2  57  39  47  57  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute items such that the total valuation is as high as possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest value each agent has for an item.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Try to maximize the total sum of valuations.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuation is for item 2 (88), assign item 2 to agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuation is for item 2 (95), but item 2 is already allocated.
  - Next highest valuation is for item 3 (56), assign item 3 to agent 1.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuation is for item 0 (57) and item 3 (57), but item 3 is already allocated.
  - Assign item 0 to agent 2 as it has the same valuation as their highest available item.

Remaining items (1 and 4):

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (45), assign item 1 to agent 1.

- **Agent 0**:
  - Lastly, assign item 4 to agent 0 since it's the only one left.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations.
