Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  10  71  39  52
1  42  64  99  72  41
2  46   0  21  81  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach for this allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:**
   - Review each agent's valuation for each item and identify which agent values each item the most.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Allocate each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for it, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

3. **Adjust If Necessary:**
   - If an agent ends up with no items, adjust by considering second-highest valuations or swapping between agents to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's apply this approach:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values this the most at 96.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values this the most at 64.
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values this the most at 99.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values this the most at 81.
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values this the most at 73.

Now, check allocation:

- Agent 0: Item [0]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4]

Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
