Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  14   9  33  89
1  51  60  78  46  27
2   3  84  32  66  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's consider a strategy where we try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (94), Item 4 (89)
   - Assign Items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (78), Item 1 (60)
   - Assign Items 2 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining item is Item 3, which Agent 2 values at 66.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high individual valuations, and all items are allocated without exceeding the total of 5 items.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
