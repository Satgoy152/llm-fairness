Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  15  73  73  52
1  11  98  35  70   3
2   1  79  54   9  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and a total of 5 items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [28, 15, 73, 73, 52]
- Agent 1: [11, 98, 35, 70, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 79, 54, 9, 86]

We must select items so that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, to maintain fairness, while maximizing their satisfaction. 

Here is a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Assign high value items to each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 highly (73 each). Assign one of these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly (98). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly (86). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate the remaining items**:
   - After the initial distribution, the remaining items are 0 and 3 for allocation.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (28) moderately, which is the highest among the remaining available items for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (70) more than Agent 2 does. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Ensure each agent has items**:
   - Currently, Agent 0 has items [2, 0], Agent 1 has items [1, 3], and Agent 2 has item [4]. This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and no items are left unallocated.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations and ensures that all items are allocated.
