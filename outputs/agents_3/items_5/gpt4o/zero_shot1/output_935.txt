Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  16   3  46  26
1  78  72   1  58  94
2  89  44  26   0  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [89 44 26  0 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  16   3  46  26
1  78  72   1  58  94
2  89  44  26   0  78
```

Our goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that all items are allocated and no item is double-allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - The highest valuation for agent 0 is item 0 (value 62).

2. Agent 1:
   - The highest valuation for agent 1 is item 4 (value 94).

3. Agent 2:
   - The highest valuation for agent 2 is item 0 (value 89) but it is already allocated, so we consider the next highest, which is item 4 (value 78), but it's already allocated, so we go to item 1 (value 44).

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items:

4. Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 46) as it is their second-highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet.
5. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 1) as it's the only remaining unallocated item.

After this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent has an integer number of items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```
