Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  70  52  80  20
1  84  82  50  84  89
2   7  41  13  16  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 7 41 13 16 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations:

Agent 0: 
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 70
- Item 2: 52
- Item 3: 80
- Item 4: 20

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 82
- Item 2: 50
- Item 3: 84
- Item 4: 89

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 7
- Item 1: 41
- Item 2: 13
- Item 3: 16
- Item 4: 88

To maximize fairness and valuation:

- Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 89. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 also values item 3 highly at 84, which is tied with Agent 0's valuation. As Agent 1 has a slightly higher overall valuation for the high-value items, assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 0 at 84, which is tied with Agent 1's valuation but Agent 1 already has high-value items. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 70, which is second-highest after Agent 1's 82, but item 1 is already allocated. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 13, which is not high compared to other allocations, but remaining only option. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
