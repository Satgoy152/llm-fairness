Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  44   8  39  80
1  48  43  91   6  98
2  61  72  87   8  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [61 72 87  8 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Assign the highest valued item for each agent:** Start by looking at each agent's highest valued item and tentatively assign it to them if it hasn't already been assigned to another agent.

2. **Resolve conflicts:** If an item is the highest valued for more than one agent, compare the agents' second highest preferences and assign based on the highest remaining value.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** Make sure that all items are allocated, resolving any remaining unallocated items based on the next highest available valuation for any agent.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

### Agent 0:
- Highest value item: 0 (value 80)
- Second highest item: 4 (value 80)

### Agent 1:
- Highest value item: 4 (value 98)
- Second highest item: 2 (value 91)

### Agent 2:
- Highest value item: 2 (value 87)
- Second highest item: 1 (value 72)

### Tentative Allocation:
1. **Agent 0:** Item 0
2. **Agent 1:** Item 4
3. **Agent 2:** Item 2

### Remaining Items:
- Items 1 and 3 are unallocated.

### Resolve Remaining Items:
- Item 1: 
  - Agent 2 values it the most (72)
- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (39 vs. 6)

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1:** Item 4
- **Agent 2:** Items 2, 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
