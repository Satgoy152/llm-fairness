Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  72  62  59  47
1  69  34  15  85  34
2   3  96  55   2  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Among the items, Agent 0 values item 1 the highest with a valuation of 72. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest with a valuation of 85. We allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 with a valuation of 96. We allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated three items, and there are two more items to allocate (items 2 and 4).

4. **Allocating remaining items**: 
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 15, and Agent 2 at 55. The highest valuation is by Agent 0, so item 2 goes to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 34, and Agent 2 at 22. The highest valuation is by Agent 0, so item 4 goes to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
