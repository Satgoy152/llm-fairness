Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  93  85  83  33
1  69  40  73  47  77
2  49  25  29  55   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. However, since there are only 5 items and 3 agents, not every agent will receive the same number of items, so we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [0, 93, 85, 83, 33]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [69, 40, 73, 47, 77]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [49, 25, 29, 55, 1]

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (93).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high valuation for it (73).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (55).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it (69) and it is not highly valued by the other agents.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0, as they have a higher valuation for it (33) compared to Agent 2 (1), and Agent 1 already has two items.

This allocation considers the highest preferences and attempts to fairly distribute the items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
