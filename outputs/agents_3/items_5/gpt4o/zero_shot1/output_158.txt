Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95   5  69  83  17
1  65   9   0  29   6
2  58  72  44  84  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. Let's look at the valuations and try to make assignments that maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [95, 5, 69, 83, 17]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [65, 9, 0, 29, 6]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [58, 72, 44, 84, 17]

We'll start by assigning items to the agents based on the highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (95).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (72).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (69).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (84).
5. **Item 4**: Lowest overall valuation, can be given to Agent 1 (6) to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share, with the items distributed according to their highest valuations.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
