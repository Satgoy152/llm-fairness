Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  17  90  66  99
1  18  11  11  84  52
2  28  80   7  63  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 80  7 63 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair number of items.

Given the values:
```
Agent 0: [25, 17, 90, 66, 99]
Agent 1: [18, 11, 11, 84, 52]
Agent 2: [28, 80, 7, 63, 89]
```

Let's evaluate each item's highest value and allocate accordingly:
- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 28.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 80.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.

Now, let's make sure we distribute the items fairly. Each agent should ideally get at least one item if possible, while keeping total allocations to 5.

Initial allocation based on highest values:
- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]

This initial allocation gives Agent 0 two items, Agent 1 one item, and Agent 2 two items, totaling 5 items, which is fair.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
