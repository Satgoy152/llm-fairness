Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  28  77  23  28
1  12  44  26  33  48
2  35  56   6  24  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 44 26 33 48]
 [35 56  6 24 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We will attempt to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** 53, 28, 77, 23, 28
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** 12, 44, 26, 33, 48
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** 35, 56, 6, 24, 49

To achieve a fair allocation:
- Assign items to agents in such a way that tries to maximize their respective total valuations, while ensuring an even distribution of the items.
- Consider the highest valued items for each agent and assign them accordingly, while ensuring only 5 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:
- Agent 0 receives item 2 (value 77) and item 0 (value 53).
- Agent 1 receives item 4 (value 48) and item 1 (value 44).
- Agent 2 receives item 3 (value 24).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to balance the distribution of value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that only 5 items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.
