Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  90  88  59  75
1  57  29  92  53  26
2  62   4  83  97  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a variation of the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents and items form the two sets of the bipartite graph, and the weights are the valuations.

Considering the given valuations:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 57 | 90 | 88 | 59 | 75 |
| 1          | 57 | 29 | 92 | 53 | 26 |
| 2          | 62 |  4 | 83 | 97 | 24 |

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (97), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (92), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (90), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
4. For item 0, agent 2 has the highest value (62), but since agent 2 already has an item, we consider agent 0 and agent 1. Both value it equally (57), but since agent 1 only has one item, let's assign item 0 to agent 1.
5. For item 4, agent 0 values it the highest (75), so assign item 4 to agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an item if possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and agents receive an integer number of items.
