Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82   8  63  27  28
1  50   2  99  16  93
2  21  11  58  56  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [21 11 58 56 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will use a greedy approach by attempting to allocate the item with the highest valuation to each agent, moving to the next highest if the item is already taken.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 82, 8, 63, 27, 28
- Agent 1: 50, 2, 99, 16, 93
- Agent 2: 21, 11, 58, 56, 47

To maximize total valuation, let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value = 99).
2. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (value = 82).
3. Allocate item 4 to agent 1 (value = 93).
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 2 (value = 56).
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (value = 11).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and it maximizes the total valuation across all agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
