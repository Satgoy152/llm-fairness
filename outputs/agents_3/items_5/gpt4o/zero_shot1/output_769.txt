Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  41  66  89  41
1  64  62  35  93  55
2   8  24  38  86  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total valuation for each agent is reasonably balanced. We'll aim for a balanced distribution of high-value items among the agents.

Let's analyze the table to allocate the items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  41  66  89  41
1  64  62  35  93  55
2   8  24  38  86  42
```

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (89), Item 0 (69), Item 2 (66).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 1 (62), Item 0 (64).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (86), Item 4 (42), Item 2 (38).

Allocating items based on highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 93).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation of 69 for them).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation of 42 for them).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation of 62).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 66).

This allocation considers a balance of values and ensures each agent gets at least one item.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
