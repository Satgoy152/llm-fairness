Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  89   4  70  25
1  98  56  81  34  13
2   6   7  40  13  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 13

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 89

One potential approach to fairly allocate the items is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's assign the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (98).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (81).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (70).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (89).

Now, let's check to ensure the allocation is fair and each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2].
- Agent 2 receives item [4].

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
