Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  81  67  18  73
1  91  47  37   6  64
2   3  15  84  97  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided. We aim to assign items such that agents get items they value highly, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item whenever possible.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: Look at the highest values in each row, as these indicate the items most valued by each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
    - For Agent 0, the highest valued item is item 1 with a valuation of 81.
    - For Agent 1, the highest valued item is item 0 with a valuation of 91.
    - For Agent 2, the highest valued item is item 3 with a valuation of 97.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction.
    - Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 2, as they highly value it at 84.
    - Item 4 can be allocated to Agent 0, as they value it at 73.

Based on these allocations, we can form the distribution as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all 5 items are allocated.
