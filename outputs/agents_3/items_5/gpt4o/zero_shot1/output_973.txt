Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  27  29  53   8
1  27   2  78   7   1
2  46  69  49  93  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We'll assign the items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Item 0: Valuation is 76 (highest among agents).
    - Item 3: Valuation is 53 (second highest for this item, but Agent 2 gets higher value items).

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Item 2: Valuation is 78 (highest among agents).

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Item 1: Valuation is 69 (highest among agents).
    - Item 4: Valuation is 81 (highest among agents).

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent valuing it the most or based on maximizing their total valuation given the constraints. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations.
