Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41   2  70  69  85
1   1  83  83  91  73
2  28  18  75  61  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 83 83 91 73]
 [28 18 75 61 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items. We can start by analyzing the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: [41, 2, 70, 69, 85]
- Agent 1: [1, 83, 83, 91, 73]
- Agent 2: [28, 18, 75, 61, 22]

Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets the items with the highest value to them, while ensuring that each item is allocated only once and that all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items are item 4 (85) and item 2 (70).
  
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item is item 3 (91), followed by item 1 (83).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item is item 2 (75), but since it is already taken by Agent 0, the next best options are item 3 (61) and item 0 (28).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 85 for agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 91 for agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 75 for agent 2).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 41 for agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 83 for agent 1).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Now, let's present the allocation as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
