Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  29   4  94  71
1  93  88  28   2  73
2  27  74  41  80   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 88 28  2 73]
 [27 74 41 80  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. We will assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to ensure fairness.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [57, 29, 4, 94, 71]
- Agent 1 values: [93, 88, 28, 2, 73]
- Agent 2 values: [27, 74, 41, 80, 3]

We'll begin by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent, while ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

1. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest among all agents).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 93 (highest among all agents).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it at 74 (highest among remaining agents).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 71 (highest among remaining agents).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it at 41 (highest among remaining agents).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has items assigned, and all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
