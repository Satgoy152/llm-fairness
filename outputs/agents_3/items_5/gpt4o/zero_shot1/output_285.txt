Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  47  43  32  56
1  93  67  53  35  54
2   8  45  85  76  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items:

Agent 0:
- Highest value: Item 4 (56)
- Next highest: Item 1 (47)
- Next highest: Item 2 (43)

Agent 1:
- Highest value: Item 0 (93)
- Next highest: Item 1 (67)
- Next highest: Item 2 (53)

Agent 2:
- Highest value: Item 2 (85)
- Next highest: Item 3 (76)
- Next highest: Item 1 (45)

Now let's try to allocate the items:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).

Now, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2, Item 3

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
