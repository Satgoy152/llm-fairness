Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  94  84  49  71
1   5  90  51  10   6
2  37  87  33  22  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that considers each agent's valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations: [41, 94, 84, 49, 71]
- Agent 1 has valuations: [5, 90, 51, 10, 6]
- Agent 2 has valuations: [37, 87, 33, 22, 70]

A fair allocation should consider maximizing the sum of valuations distributed to each agent. We can use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 41
   - Agent 1: 5
   - Agent 2: 37
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 94
   - Agent 1: 90
   - Agent 2: 87
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 84
   - Agent 1: 51
   - Agent 2: 33
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 49
   - Agent 1: 10
   - Agent 2: 22
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 71
   - Agent 1: 6
   - Agent 2: 70
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

However, allocating all items to Agent 0 will not be fair. Therefore, let's try redistributing considering alternative assignments:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

This distribution ensures each agent gets items based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
