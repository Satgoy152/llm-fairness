Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  12  56  54  16
1  96  50  36   5  98
2   0   1   4  57  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the valuations of each item by each agent. One possible approach is to first assign items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's distribute the items based on the highest valuation per item:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 0  
   Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 50 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 1  
   Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 56 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 4  
   Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 57 (highest)  
   Assign to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 98 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 95  
   Assign to Agent 1.

With this allocation, we ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 2 gets Item 3.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
