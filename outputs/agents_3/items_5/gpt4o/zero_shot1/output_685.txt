Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  71  24  91   5
1  65  28  13  90  49
2  81  98  11  72  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 71 24 91  5]
 [65 28 13 90 49]
 [81 98 11 72 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 10, 71, 24, 91, 5
Agent 1: 65, 28, 13, 90, 49
Agent 2: 81, 98, 11, 72, 79
```

Let's consider an allocation strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (91).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (65).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (98).

For the remaining items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (24) more than others.
- Agent 1 values item 4 (49) more than others.

Thus, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```
