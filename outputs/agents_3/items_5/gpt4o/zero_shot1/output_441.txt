Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  25  19  90  76
1  48  80  54  83  93
2   8  83  53  94  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [5, 25, 19, 90, 76]
- Agent 1 values: [48, 80, 54, 83, 93]
- Agent 2 values: [8, 83, 53, 94, 67]

We will attempt to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 5
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 8
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 2 values it at 67
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

Based on this analysis, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Agent 0 unfortunately receives no items, but the allocation maximizes the total valuation among the agents.
