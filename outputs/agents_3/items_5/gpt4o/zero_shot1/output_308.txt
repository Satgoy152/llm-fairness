Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  64  10  36  77
1   4  66  42  24  29
2  55  96  51  38  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (77)
   - Second highest value: Item 1 (64)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (66)
   - Second highest value: Item 2 (42)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (96)
   - Second highest value: Item 2 (51)

Considering these valuations and to ensure fairness, we can assign the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Item 4 (77)
- Agent 1 receives Item 2 (42)
- Agent 2 receives Item 1 (96)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining two items (0 and 3). We can consider the next highest preferences of the agents:

- Agent 0's next highest preference is Item 3 (36)
- Agent 2's next highest preference is Item 0 (55)

Thus, the fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives Item 4 and Item 3
- Agent 1 receives Item 2
- Agent 2 receives Item 1 and Item 0

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
