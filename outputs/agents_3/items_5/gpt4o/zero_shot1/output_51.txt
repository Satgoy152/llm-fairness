Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  43  59  94  96
1  98  40  44  77  16
2  96   8  48  69  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives or distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is somewhat balanced.

A possible allocation strategy considering the valuated table is:

1. Assign items to maximize individual agent satisfaction.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  43  59  94  96
1  98  40  44  77  16
2  96   8  48  69  87
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (96), so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (98), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (69), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Now, we are left with items 1 and 2.
- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (59), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Finally, assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values item 1 higher than agent 2.

This distribution gives each agent a reasonable allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
