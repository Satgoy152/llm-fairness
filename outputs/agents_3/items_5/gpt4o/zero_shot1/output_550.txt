Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  33  34  49   0
1  45  28   8  33  27
2  99  38  40  96  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for this agent is item 0 with a value of 79.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for this agent is item 0 with a value of 45, but since item 0 is already allocated, we look at the next highest, which is item 3 with a value of 33.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for this agent is item 0 with a value of 99, but it's already taken, so we choose item 3 with a value of 96.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1, 2, and 4:

- Agent 0: Already has item 0.
- Agent 1: Already has item 3.
- Agent 2: Could take item 4 with a value of 86.

We continue the allocation:

- Agent 0: Takes item 1 since it provides the highest remaining value (33).
- Agent 2: Takes item 2 since it offers a reasonable value of 40.

Now, all items are allocated, and no agent is left without items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to give each agent a high total valuation.
