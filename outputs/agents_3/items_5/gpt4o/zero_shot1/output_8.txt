Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  90  89  83  69
1   9  83  31  57  13
2  77  48  27   8  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair allocation.

Agent 0's valuations: [60, 90, 89, 83, 69]  
Agent 1's valuations: [9, 83, 31, 57, 13]  
Agent 2's valuations: [77, 48, 27, 8, 81]  

One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (77)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (90)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (89)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (83)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (81)

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair and balanced:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 doesn't have the highest valuation for any item.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

Adjusting to ensure fairness and integer allocations:

- Since Agent 1 has no items, we can re-evaluate item 3, which Agent 1 values second highest after Agent 0. Change allocation of item 3 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering the highest valuations and maintaining fairness.
