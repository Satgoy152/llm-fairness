Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  52  10  13  86
1  49  73  34  34  14
2  23  99  71  64  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach:

1. **Determine the Preferences:** Each agent has different valuations for the items. We should aim to allocate items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Begin by assigning items to agents who value them the most.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Each agent should ideally receive at least one item if possible, given the constraint of integer allocation and a total of five items.

Let's begin by analyzing the table:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows: [4, 52, 10, 13, 86]
- **Agent 1** values items as follows: [49, 73, 34, 34, 14]
- **Agent 2** values items as follows: [23, 99, 71, 64, 28]

**Step 1: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:**
- Item 0: Highest value is 49 by Agent 1.
- Item 1: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is 71 by Agent 2.
- Item 3: Highest value is 64 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 86 by Agent 0.

**Step 2: Review the allocations for balance and fairness:**
- Agent 0 receives Item 4.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1, 2, 3.

This allocation ensures that Agent 1, who values Item 0 the most, gets it. Agent 2, who has the highest valuation for Items 1, 2, and 3, receives them. Agent 0 gets Item 4, which they value the most, among the remaining items.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
