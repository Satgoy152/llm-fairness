Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  37   0  86  26
1  90  51  45   9  59
2  88  31  51  88  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 5 items distributed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 3 (86), so we can allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 0 (90), so we can allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 4 (72), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 2.

4. Among the remaining items (1 and 2), we should allocate them based on the next highest valuations. 

   - For item 1: 
     - Agent 1 values it at 51
     - Agent 2 values it at 31
     - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

   - For item 2:
     - Agent 1 values it at 45
     - Agent 2 values it at 51
     - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Thus, the fair allocation considering the highest valuations is:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 4.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
