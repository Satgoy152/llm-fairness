Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  73  18  15  63
1  53  84  33  65  38
2  56  19  31  72  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. Here's a step-by-step strategy for this allocation:

1. Start by considering the highest valuations across all agents for each item and assign that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and no more than the total available items are allocated.

2. Iterate over each item and determine which agent values it the most. Assign the item to that agent.

3. Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent has a fair number of items without any leftover.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 53, and Agent 2 at 56. The highest valuation is from Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 84, and Agent 2 at 19. The highest valuation is from Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 33, and Agent 2 at 31. The highest valuation is from Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 65, and Agent 2 at 72. The highest valuation is from Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 at 38, and Agent 2 at 72. The highest valuation is from Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0]
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 2]
- Agent 2 gets items: [3, 4]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
