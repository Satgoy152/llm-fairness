Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  31  57  67  62
1  60  32  11  93   7
2  78  28  94  26  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [78 28 94 26 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent according to their preferences. We will try to assign items to agents such that they receive high-value items according to their valuations.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 
   - Item 3 (67)
   - Item 4 (62)

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 0 (60)
   - Item 3 (93)

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items:
   - Item 2 (94)
   - Item 0 (78)

Given these preferences, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 1**, as it has the highest valuation (93).
- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 2**, as it has the highest valuation (94).
- Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 0**, as it has a high valuation (62) for this agent.
- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 1**, as it is their second-highest valuation (60) and Agent 2 already received a high-value item.
- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 0**, since Agent 0 has high valuation for this item (31) compared to Agent 2 (28).

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [1, 4]
- **Agent 1** gets items [0, 3]
- **Agent 2** gets item [2]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with relatively high valuations according to their preferences, while all items are allocated.
