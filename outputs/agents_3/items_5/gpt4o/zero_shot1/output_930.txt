Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  31  74  43  15
1  75  17  89  38  74
2  56  81  59  77  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. A common approach to solving such problems is the "Hungarian Algorithm" or by simply trying out combinations to check which one leads to a fair distribution.

Let's try to allocate these items in a way that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value for each is balanced as best as possible.

Here is a solution based on a balanced distribution:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value = 88)
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value = 89)
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value = 81)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value = 77)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value = 74)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 gets item 0 with a total value of 88.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4 with a total value of 163.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3 with a total value of 158.

This is a fairly distributed allocation considering the constraints.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
