Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  78  57  35   2
1  30  32  81  82   0
2  68  54  88  94  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value assigned to each agent. We can approach this as an optimization problem, trying to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering the highest valued items for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (68), item 1 (78), and item 2 (57).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (82) and item 2 (81).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (94), item 2 (88), and item 4 (88).

A possible allocation could be:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 78 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 94 for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 81 for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 68 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 88 for Agent 2).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's value based on their individual preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
