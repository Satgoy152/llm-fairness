Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  94  28  22  82
1  45  67  65   3  94
2  99  34  28  79  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their preferences. Here's one approach to achieve a fairly balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for item 1 (94) and item 0 (88).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value for item 4 (94).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value for item 0 (99) and item 3 (79).

Now, let's allocate the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is 5.

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has a relatively higher value for it compared to Agent 1).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items considering their valuations.
