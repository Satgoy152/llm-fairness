Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  45  12  29   6
1   1  36  70  71  55
2  94  95  85  46  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuation for items: [99, 45, 12, 29, 6]
   - Best item: Item 0 with a valuation of 99.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuation for items: [1, 36, 70, 71, 55]
   - Best items: Item 3 with a valuation of 71.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuation for items: [94, 95, 85, 46, 50]
   - Best items: Item 1 with a valuation of 95 and Item 2 with a valuation of 85.

Now, we have assigned 4 items. The remaining item is Item 4. We should assign it to the agent who values it the most and has received fewer items.

- Item 4 has the following valuations: Agent 0: 6, Agent 1: 55, Agent 2: 50.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, who values it at 55.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 2.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
