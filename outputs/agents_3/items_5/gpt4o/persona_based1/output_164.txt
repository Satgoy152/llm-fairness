Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  52  77  44  55
1  49  79   6   3  25
2  29  21  79  92  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One approach is to use an envy-free algorithm like the "envy-free up to one good" (EF1) heuristic, which ensures that any envy is limited to at most one item.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [95, 52, 77, 44, 55]
- Agent 1 values: [49, 79, 6, 3, 25]
- Agent 2 values: [29, 21, 79, 92, 69]

Now let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3** (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly, potentially minimizing envy. Here's how it breaks down:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2 (valued at 95 and 77 respectively).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (valued at 79).
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4 (valued at 92 and 69 respectively).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes the potential for envy.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
