Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  53  48  45  10
1  70  92  64  72  95
2  96  81  61  44  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 92 64 72 95]
 [96 81 61 44 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, which is often a practical approach in fair division problems. We aim to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [35, 53, 48, 45, 10]
- Agent 1: [70, 92, 64, 72, 95]
- Agent 2: [96, 81, 61, 44, 70]

We can start by trying to balance the total value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1. This is the highest valued item for Agent 1 and reduces potential envy since it is also the least valued item for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as this is the highest valued item for Agent 2 and significantly more valuable to Agent 2 than to Agent 0 or Agent 1.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. This is the second-highest valued item for Agent 1 and helps balance the total value.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This item has a fairly high value for Agent 0 and is not the optimal choice for either Agent 1 or Agent 2.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0. This helps balance the total value among agents and is a better allocation for Agent 0 than for the others.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total values and minimize envy among agents given the constraints of integer allocations.
