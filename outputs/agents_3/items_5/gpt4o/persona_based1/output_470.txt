Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  94  31  46  60
1  68  41  65  44  18
2  58  31  96  53  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, aiming to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:** Verify that all items are allocated, and adjust if necessary to ensure no agent feels significantly envious.

3. **Balance the Number of Items:** Try to allocate an equal or nearly equal number of items to each agent, if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value: 68).
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value: 94).
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value: 96).
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value: 53).
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value: 75).

Based on the initial allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0.
- Agent 2 gets Items 2, 3, and 4.

Final allocation considering envy-freeness:

- **Agent 0:** [1]
- **Agent 1:** [0]
- **Agent 2:** [2, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
