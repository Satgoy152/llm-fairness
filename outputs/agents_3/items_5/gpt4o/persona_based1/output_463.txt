Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  12  26  45  91
1  27   8  18  61  81
2  60  77  51  50  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 77 51 50 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction, which involves minimizing envy among the agents. One approach to achieve this is to use the Envy-Free method, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [93, 12, 26, 45, 91]
- Agent 1: [27, 8, 18, 61, 81]
- Agent 2: [60, 77, 51, 50, 42]

We need to allocate the 5 items (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) among the 3 agents (0, 1, 2).

To achieve an allocation that is as fair as possible, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on each possible allocation to minimize envy.
2. Assign items to agents trying to balance their total perceived value.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest values are for items 0 (93) and 4 (91).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest values are for items 4 (81) and 3 (61).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest values are for items 1 (77) and 2 (51).

Based on these preferences, we can make the following allocations:

- Allocate item 0 and 4 to **Agent 0**.
- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 1**.
- Allocate item 1 and 2 to **Agent 2**.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, thus minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
