Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  27  43  22  62
1   9  12  96  80   6
2  49  40  77   0  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we start by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations, and to minimize or eliminate envy.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

```
Agent valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  27  43  22  62
1   9  12  96  80   6
2  49  40  77   0  54
```

A possible way to ensure fairness is to use the Envy-Free approach. We look for allocations that will be perceived as fair by each agent according to their valuations.

Let's construct an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (86) and item 4 (62). 
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (96) and then item 3 (80).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (77), but itâ€™s already taken. Next highest is item 4 (54), then item 0 (49).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

After the first round, we have:
- Agent 0 has item 0.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has item 4.

Remaining items are 1 and 3.

4. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest valuation for available items is item 3 (80).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest remaining valuation is for item 1 (40).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now each item is allocated, and we have:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

These allocations are fair in the sense that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
