Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  65  21  44  45
1  39  47  26  83  58
2  81  42  32  61  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We also want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 5 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 44
  - Item 4: 45

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 83
  - Item 4: 58

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 61
  - Item 4: 38

We can use a simple allocation method that tries to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value most while ensuring the total allocation is fair.

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring that each item is only given to one agent:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (value 81)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 65)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 26)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (value 83)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (value 45)

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item based on their highest valued items.

Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
