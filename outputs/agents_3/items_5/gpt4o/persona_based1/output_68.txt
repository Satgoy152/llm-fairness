Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  58  31  90  37
1  57  29  45  76  90
2  63  21  35  25  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent does not feel envy towards others based on their own valuations. A simple way to approach this is to use the maximum value each agent assigns to the items and aim for each agent to receive approximately equal total value based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [43, 58, 31, 90, 37]
- Agent 1 values: [57, 29, 45, 76, 90]
- Agent 2 values: [63, 21, 35, 25, 11]

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign high-value items to the corresponding agents**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (90).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (63).

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance the total value**:
   - After assigning the highest value items, we are left with items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 0 can be assigned item 1 since it offers a decent valuation of 58.
   - Agent 1 can be assigned item 2, which offers a valuation of 45.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one high-value item and tries to keep the total valuation as balanced as possible, given the constraints.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring that the total number of items distributed equals 5.
