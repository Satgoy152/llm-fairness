Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  84  92  90  99
1  14  51  35  76  50
2  94  13   9  12  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Here is one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 99.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 76.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 94.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each agent their most valued item initially to reduce potential envy.
   - Distribute remaining items to balance the total valuation across agents as evenly as possible.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value (99).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value (76).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 as it has the highest value (94).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 1 and 2.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 92) as it would maximize their remaining value.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 51) to balance out the valuations.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 2 (total value: 99 + 92 = 191).
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 1 (total value: 76 + 51 = 127).
- Agent 2 receives item 0 (total value: 94).

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations and the fixed number of items.
