Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  21  12  84   1
1  39  68  50   2  65
2  99  78  81  57   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while attempting to minimize envy. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive, considering the constraint that each item can only be allocated to one agent.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [55, 21, 12, 84, 1]
- Agent 1: [39, 68, 50, 2, 65]
- Agent 2: [99, 78, 81, 57, 0]

### Steps:
1. **Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (99)**. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (84)**. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (68)**. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (65)**. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 2 has the remaining high valuation for item 2 (81)**. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Each agent receives a subset of items that maximizes their total perceived value, reducing the potential for envy. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's total valuation is considered to minimize envy.
