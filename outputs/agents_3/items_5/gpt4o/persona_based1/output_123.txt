Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  75  57  52  54
1  54  45  16  39  47
2  49  62  37  72  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while attempting to ensure envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the table of valuations:

```
       Items
    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  75  57  52  54
1  54  45  16  39  47
2  49  62  37  72  70
```

We want to allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents in such a way as to balance their satisfaction.

One potential allocation that considers the differences in valuations and attempts to balance satisfaction is as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as this is the highest-valued item for any agent.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has a high valuation for Agent 2, and Agent 0 already received a high-value item.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly more than others.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, who values it the most.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, who values the remaining items similarly, but this allocation balances the number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and attempts to balance the distribution based on their valuations.
