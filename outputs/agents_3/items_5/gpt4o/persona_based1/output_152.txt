Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50   6  35  30  75
1  67   5  87  62  40
2  85  54  41  86  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [85 54 41 86 99]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents with consideration for envy-freeness, we need to assess the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [50, 6, 35, 30, 75]
- Agent 1: [67, 5, 87, 62, 40]
- Agent 2: [85, 54, 41, 86, 99]

Let's allocate the items by considering each agent's highest-valued items first to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (99) and item 0 (85). Let's assign item 4 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (87). Let's assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (75), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 0 (50). However, item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2 as well. Let's assign item 0 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 also highly valued item 0.

Now:
- Agent 2 has items 4 and 0.
- Agent 1 has item 2.

Remaining items are 1 and 3.

4. **Agent 0** has high value for item 3 (30), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 0** is the only agent with an unfilled allocation, and item 1 has relatively low value for all, but Agent 0 values it the least (6). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This allocation ensures each agent gets the items they value most, reducing potential envy.

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
