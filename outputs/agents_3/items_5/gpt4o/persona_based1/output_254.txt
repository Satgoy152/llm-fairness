Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  73  87  86   7
1  11  29  30  66  16
2  89  26  34  52  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can follow a strategy that considers each agent's preferences to the extent possible. Here's a proposed allocation:

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and determine the most preferred items for each agent:

Agent 0's total valuation:  
- Item 0: 26, Item 1: 73, Item 2: 87, Item 3: 86, Item 4: 7  
- Total = 26 + 73 + 87 + 86 + 7 = 279

Agent 1's total valuation:  
- Item 0: 11, Item 1: 29, Item 2: 30, Item 3: 66, Item 4: 16  
- Total = 11 + 29 + 30 + 66 + 16 = 152

Agent 2's total valuation:  
- Item 0: 89, Item 1: 26, Item 2: 34, Item 3: 52, Item 4: 51  
- Total = 89 + 26 + 34 + 52 + 51 = 252

Next, let's allocate items based on their highest preference and attempt to achieve envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   Agent 0 highly values item 2 (87) and item 3 (86). Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   Agent 1 highly values item 3 (66), but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. Agent 1's next preference is item 2 (30), but it is also taken. Therefore, allocate item 1 (29) to Agent 1, which is their next highest preference.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   Agent 2 highly values item 0 (89), so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2. Agent 2â€™s next preference is item 4 (51), which is still available, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the allocations:  
- Agent 0 has items [2, 3]  
- Agent 1 has item [1]  
- Agent 2 has items [0, 4]  

Each agent has received items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
