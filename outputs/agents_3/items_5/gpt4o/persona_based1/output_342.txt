Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  26  35  50  46
1  28  79  77  97  25
2  61  62  77  55  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, taking into account the agents' valuations of each item. Given the valuations, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, considering their individual preferences.

Let's first summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(15 + 26 + 35 + 50 + 46 = 172\)
- Agent 1: \(28 + 79 + 77 + 97 + 25 = 306\)
- Agent 2: \(61 + 62 + 77 + 55 + 74 = 329\)

Next, we will use a strategy to allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring each gets an equitable share based on their valuations.

1. **Allocate the highest-valued items:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97) compared to others. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 (74) highly compared to others. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 2 also values item 2 highly (77), and no other agent values it as highly. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (79) the most, and no other agent values it as highly. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (15) the least, but no other agent values it much higher. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
