Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  64  99  73  85
1  85  54   6  12  22
2  52  30  19  26  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, or at least a fair division based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring they receive an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [21, 64, 99, 73, 85]
   - Total Value: 342

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [85, 54, 6, 12, 22]
   - Total Value: 179

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [52, 30, 19, 26, 45]
   - Total Value: 172

Our aim is to allocate items in such a way that we maximize the value for each agent while ensuring no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's allocate the items based on each agent's highest valuation:

- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most (99), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most (85), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the second most (85), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the third most (64), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (26), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

After allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring they receive an integer number of items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
