Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  82   4  22  23
1  87  57  95  99  35
2  40  97  68  88  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to satisfy certain fairness criteria, such as envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent/Item  0   1   2   3   4
0           72  82   4  22  23
1           87  57  95  99  35
2           40  97  68  88  13
```

We want to allocate all 5 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the distribution is as fair as possible. Let's proceed with the allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while trying to make the distribution envy-free.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation of any item for item 3 (valuation of 99). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (valuation of 97). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (valuation of 72). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

4. Now consider the remaining items (2, 4) and their valuations:
   - Agent 0: 4, 23
   - Agent 1: 95, 35
   - Agent 2: 68, 13

   Agent 1 values item 2 very highly (valuation of 95). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

5. The remaining item is 4. Agent 0 values it at 23, which is the highest remaining valuation for that item compared to Agent 1 (35) and Agent 2 (13). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
