Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  29  87  96  70
1  65  28  79  54  19
2  16   9  33  94  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to maximize their satisfaction. We need to allocate all 5 items, and each agent should get an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation that tries to balance the agents' valuations:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (96).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly (79).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (94) but slightly less than Agent 0.
   
2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for them.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to further balance their total valuation since they still have good value for it.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as a complementary high-value item.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 to ensure all items are allocated.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 2 receives item 4.

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences and ensures that all items are distributed. The specific allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
