Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  62  32  37  87
1  46  68  89  25  15
2  48  14  27  56  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. A common approach to achieve a fair division is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, which means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent more than their own allocation.

Given the table of valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 71 | 62 | 32 | 37 | 87 |
| 1          | 46 | 68 | 89 | 25 | 15 |
| 2          | 48 | 14 | 27 | 56 | 61 |

We can use a heuristic method to allocate items, trying to maximize the total value each agent receives subject to the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.

One possible allocation strategy involves the following steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to each item.
2. Allocate items to agents based on who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through this process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (71).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (62).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most (56).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (87).

Using this approach, agent 0 gets three items (0, 1, 4), agent 1 gets one item (2), and agent 2 gets one item (3).

Allocating items based on these preferences:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and tends to maximize the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
