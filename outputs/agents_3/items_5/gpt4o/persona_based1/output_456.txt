Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  37  58  59  94
1  78  11  70   2  75
2  54  23  29  74  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution. This involves maximizing the product of the utilities (valuations) each agent receives from their allocated items. 

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively higher valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 more than the others.

Given these preferences, an allocation that attempts to balance these valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4 (valuation: 25 + 94 = 119)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 2 (valuation: 11 + 70 = 81)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (valuation: 74)

This allocation provides a fair distribution of items while maximizing the Nash welfare, as each agent receives items that they value relatively highly compared to others. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
