Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44   2  87   5  52
1  74  95  63  43  40
2  40  31   5   3  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44  2 87  5 52]
 [74 95 63 43 40]
 [40 31  5  3 90]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy, where each agent prefers their own allocation over others'. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the Envy-Free Matching or the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution. 

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  44   2  87   5  52
1  74  95  63  43  40
2  40  31   5   3  90
```

Let's examine possible allocations considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensure that each agent ends up with a fair share without envy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation is for Item 2 (87)
   - Second highest valuation is for Item 4 (52)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for Item 1 (95)
   - Second highest valuation is for Item 0 (74)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for Item 4 (90)
   - Second highest valuation is for Item 0 (40)

A fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (87)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (74) and 1 (95)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 (3) and 4 (90)

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent maximizes their valuation of the items they receive while minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
