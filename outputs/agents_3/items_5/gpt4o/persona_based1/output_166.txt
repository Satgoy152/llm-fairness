Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  77   7  88  40
1  99  25  25  94  29
2  30  36   5  64   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction by ensuring that no agent strictly prefers another agent's bundle over their own. In this problem, we have 3 agents and 5 items, and we need to allocate all items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (88), which is higher than any other agent's valuation for any item. Thus, we allocate item 3 to Agent 0. Additionally, Agent 0 values item 0 quite highly (53), which is also quite high compared to other agents' valuations for item 0. We allocate item 0 to Agent 0 as well.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (99), but since it has been allocated to Agent 0, we will consider the next best options. Agent 1 has high valuations for item 3 (94), but it is already allocated. The next highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 1 (25), which is not very high but the best available. Thus, we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (64), but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. The next highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 1, but it has been allocated to Agent 1. The next best is item 0, but it's taken. So we consider item 4 (8), which is available and allocate it to Agent 2.

After this initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4

Now, we have two remaining items: item 2 and item 4. Since items 0, 1, and 3 are already allocated, we need to allocate item 2 and make sure Agent 1 is not envious.

4. We allocate item 2 to Agent 2 because they have the lowest valuations overall, and this will help balance their total value.

Now, let's summarize the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences, considering envy-freeness to the extent possible given the constraints.
