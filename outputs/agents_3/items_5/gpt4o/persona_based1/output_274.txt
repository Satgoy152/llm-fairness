Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  90  81  86  98
1  71  84  12  19  24
2  97  51  50  12  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider both the valuations and the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) criterion where each agent believes that what they receive is at least as good as what any other agent receives, according to their own valuation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all the items, and then decide on a fair allocation.

Agent 0's total valuation: 
\[ 48 + 90 + 81 + 86 + 98 = 403 \]

Agent 1's total valuation:
\[ 71 + 84 + 12 + 19 + 24 = 210 \]

Agent 2's total valuation:
\[ 97 + 51 + 50 + 12 + 13 = 223 \]

To ensure fairness, we can use a method where each agent gets at least one item, and we try to balance these allocations based on their total valuation and individual valuations for each item. A good starting point is to allocate the highest valued items to the agent who values them most.

1. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (98).
2. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (97).
3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (90).
4. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (81).
5. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (19), and this is a leftover item that fits best.

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the envy is minimized based on the highest individual valuations. Agent 0 ends up with more items, but given their higher valuations, it could be seen as justified.

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free but tries to align as closely as possible with the preferences given the constraints.
