Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  35  47  27  89
1  45  27  50  62  52
2  49  71  38  72  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's preferences and try to ensure that no agent feels another has a better allocation, given their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 80 + 35 + 47 + 27 + 89 = 278
- Agent 1: 45 + 27 + 50 + 62 + 52 = 236
- Agent 2: 49 + 71 + 38 + 72 + 10 = 240

To achieve envy-freeness, we should try to allocate items so that each agent's share is roughly proportional to their total valuation.

First, let's list the items in descending order of value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 0, 2, 1, 3] with values [89, 80, 47, 35, 27]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 2, 4, 0, 1] with values [62, 50, 52, 45, 27]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 1, 0, 2, 4] with values [72, 71, 49, 38, 10]

Considering this, we can try to allocate the highest-priority items to each agent while balancing the total valuations:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2 after considering Agent 0's preference).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 after considering previous allocations).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2 after Agent 0's preference).

After these assignments, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 0] with total value 169
- Agent 1: Item [2] with total value 50
- Agent 2: Items [3, 1] with total value 143

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to balance the allocation based on valuations and priorities.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
