Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  59  10  22  94
1  91  19  99   2  28
2  70  86   7  81  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility while trying to maintain envy-freeness. Let's evaluate each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while minimizing envy among the agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 94).
   - Second highest is item 1 (value 59).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 99).
   - Second highest is item 0 (value 91).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 86).
   - Second highest is item 3 (value 81).

### Allocation:

Let's start by allocating the items based on each agent's highest preference, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

- **Agent 1** receives item 2 (value 99), as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 2** receives item 1 (value 86), as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 0** receives item 4 (value 94), as it is their highest valued item.

Now, we allocate the remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

- Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 1 (value 91), next highest is for Agent 2 (value 70).
  - Allocate item 0 to **Agent 1**.

- Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 2 (value 81), next highest is for Agent 0 (value 22).
  - Allocate item 3 to **Agent 2**.

### Final Allocation:

Considering the above allocations, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is fair based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.
