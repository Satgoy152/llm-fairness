Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  53  75  58  59
1  64  27  94  51  55
2  95  49  88  80  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that maximizes the minimum satisfaction for each agent. Envy-freeness is achieved if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  53  75  58  59
1  64  27  94  51  55
2  95  49  88  80  77
```

We aim to allocate all 5 items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that considers each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (95), which is more than any other agent's value for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (94), significantly more than other agents. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** also has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (80), higher than other agents. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (53) compared to Agent 1 (27) and Agent 2 (49). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
5. Lastly, for item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it at 77, Agent 0 at 59, and Agent 1 at 55.
   - Agent 2 already has two items. To balance the allocation, assign item 4 to Agent 1, who has fewer items.

This allocation considers the high valuations and attempts to balance the total number of items per agent:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
