Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52   9  36  64  73
1  38  74  91  74   8
2   9  86  44   6  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that ensures each agent feels they have received a "fair" share, minimizing envy. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, which helps to ensure fairness.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0:** Values are [52, 9, 36, 64, 73]
2. **Agent 1:** Values are [38, 74, 91, 74, 8]
3. **Agent 2:** Values are [9, 86, 44, 6, 96]

First, let's calculate the total value for each agent if they received all items, and determine which items are most valuable to them:

- **Agent 0 Total Value:** 234
- **Agent 1 Total Value:** 285
- **Agent 2 Total Value:** 241

Next, we identify the most valuable item for each agent:

- **Agent 0's most valuable item:** Item 4 (Value 73)
- **Agent 1's most valuable item:** Item 2 (Value 91)
- **Agent 2's most valuable item:** Item 4 (Value 96)

To achieve a fair allocation, we consider the next highest values and distribute the items to balance the allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2** as it’s the most valuable for them.
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1** as it’s the most valuable for them.
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0** as it’s the next most valuable for them.
4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2** as it's their second most valuable.
5. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0** as it’s the next most valuable for them.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their more highly valued items, minimizing envy among the agents.
