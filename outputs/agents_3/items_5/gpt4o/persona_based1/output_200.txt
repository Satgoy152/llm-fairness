Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  55  34  52  95
1  17  45  28  60   7
2  78  71  59  68  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle that maximizes their own valuation and minimizes potential envy. Here we have three agents and five items. A reasonable approach is to assign items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuations if each agent were to receive each item:

- Agent 0 values: [87, 55, 34, 52, 95] 
- Agent 1 values: [17, 45, 28, 60, 7]
- Agent 2 values: [78, 71, 59, 68, 63]

A potential allocation strategy is:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent if possible.
2. Balance remaining item allocations to mitigate envy.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (87). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (71). Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (59). Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (60). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (95). Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2]

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Agent 0 receives two items to balance their high valuations across items.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution based on the given valuations.
