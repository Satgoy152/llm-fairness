Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  93  26  33  38
1  11  99  82  39  85
2  63  81  77  65  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we will aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, given their own valuations. This is a complex problem, but we can attempt a solution that tries to minimize envy based on the given valuations.

First, let's analyze the agent valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 33
  - Item 4: 38

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 82
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 4: 85

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 59

To ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and to try to minimize envy, we can prioritize giving items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 1** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (99), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0** has the next highest valuation from Agent 0 (65), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2** has the next highest valuation from Agent 1 (82), but since Agent 1 already got Item 1, we check the next highest, which is Agent 2 (77), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3** has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (65), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4** has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (85), but since Agent 1 has already received an item, we check the next highest, which is Agent 2 (59), so we allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 5 items are distributed among the agents while trying to minimize envy based on their valuations.
