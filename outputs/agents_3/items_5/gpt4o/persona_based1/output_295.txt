Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  55  92  67  34
1  34  93  26  84  20
2  34  67  75  22   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that envy-freeness is maintained. This means that ideally, each agent should not prefer the bundle allocated to any other agent over their own.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [55, 55, 92, 67, 34]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [34, 93, 26, 84, 20]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [34, 67, 75, 22, 3]

The total number of items is 5, and each agent should receive an integer number of items.

To find an allocation that is fair, let us proceed with an allocation strategy that maximizes the sum of values for each agent and ensures that each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 92).
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 93).
3. **Agent 2:** The highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 75), but since item 2 is already allocated, we look at the next highest, which is item 1 (value 67), but item 1 is also allocated. So, we allocate item 0 (value 34) to agent 2.

Now, let's consider the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 3, 4
- Remaining agents to allocate more items: All three agents

4. Since agent 0 has been allocated one item, we can allocate the next highest valued item they haven't received, which is item 3 (value 67).
5. The final remaining item is item 4. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 3 (value 84), but since item 3 is allocated, we give item 4 to agent 1 (value 20).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
