Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  36  88  60  95
1  91  93  26  14  76
2   9  95  54   9  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their total valuation while trying to maintain a sense of fairness, potentially minimizing envy.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item and determine a fair allocation:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 21
  - Agent 1 values it at 91
  - Agent 2 values it at 9

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 36
  - Agent 1 values it at 93
  - Agent 2 values it at 95

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 88
  - Agent 1 values it at 26
  - Agent 2 values it at 54

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 60
  - Agent 1 values it at 14
  - Agent 2 values it at 9

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 95
  - Agent 1 values it at 76
  - Agent 2 values it at 48

A possible allocation strategy that seeks to minimize envy could be:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0.
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 1.
3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2.
4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 3.
5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly. Agent 0 gets three items, but these are the items they value the most. Agent 1 and Agent 2 each get one high-value item according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
