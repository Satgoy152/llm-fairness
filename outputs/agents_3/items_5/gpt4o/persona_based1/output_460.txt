Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  31  89  23  80
1  41  97  15  55  59
2  58   6  99  48  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel they received the best possible allocation given the items assigned to others, based on their valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(91 + 31 + 89 + 23 + 80 = 314\)
- Agent 1: \(41 + 97 + 15 + 55 + 59 = 267\)
- Agent 2: \(58 + 6 + 99 + 48 + 77 = 288\)

We will try to allocate items using a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while minimizing envy.

Let's break down the allocations based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item:

- **Agent 0** highly values items: 0 (91) and 2 (89).
- **Agent 1** highly values items: 1 (97) and 4 (59).
- **Agent 2** highly values items: 2 (99).

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have items 3 and 4 left to allocate. To ensure fairness, consider the next highest valued items for each agent:

- **Agent 0** has a next highest valuation for item 4 (80).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 (55) highest among remaining.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 (77) next highest.

Given this, assign:
- Item 3 to Agent 1 (as it maximizes Agent 1's total without causing significant envy).
- Item 4 to Agent 0 (as it maximizes Agent 0's total without causing significant envy).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and minimizes envy.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
