Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93   7  34  79  99
1  61   0  21  59   3
2   0  91  85  18  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Valuations Table
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  93   7  34  79  99
1  61   0  21  59   3
2   0  91  85  18  50
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a preference for item 0, but not as strong as Agent 0, and values item 3 moderately.
3. **Agent 2** values items 1 and 2 the most.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1 and 2.

This allocation considers the highest preferences for each agent, attempting to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 gets high-valued items 0 (93) and 4 (99).
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (59), which is their next best available choice.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 (91) and 2 (85), which are their highest-valued items.

### Resulting Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while aiming to maintain fairness and minimal envy among the agents.
