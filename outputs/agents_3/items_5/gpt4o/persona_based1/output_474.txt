Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  65  53  83   8
1   6  10  87  17  98
2   5  67  76   6  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's how we can attempt to achieve this:

### Valuations Table
```
       0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0: 94  65  53  83   8
Agent 1:  6  10  87  17  98
Agent 2:  5  67  76   6  51
```

### Steps to Allocate Items

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest.

2. **Assigning High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 94).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 98).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 76).

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1 and 3 remain to be allocated.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 67), as it's the highest remaining value for Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 83), as it provides a high value to Agent 0.

### Allocations
Therefore, the allocation would be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility while maintaining fairness and ensuring all items are allocated.
