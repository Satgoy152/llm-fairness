Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  51  77  44  89
1  10  72  27  95  15
2  64  75  11  60  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Since there are three agents and five items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive only one.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 44
  - Item 4: 89

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 15

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 11
  - Item 3: 60
  - Item 4: 97

First, let's rank the items based on their total value to all agents:

1. Item 4: 89 + 15 + 97 = 201
2. Item 1: 51 + 72 + 75 = 198
3. Item 3: 44 + 95 + 60 = 199
4. Item 2: 77 + 27 + 11 = 115
5. Item 0: 5 + 10 + 64 = 79

Now, let's allocate items ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 4 (89) and Item 2 (77). 
2. **Agent 1** values Item 3 (95) the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 4 (97) and Item 1 (75).

To achieve a fair allocation:

- Assign **Agent 0** Item 4 (highest value for them), and Item 0 (least valued by others).
- Assign **Agent 1** Item 3 (highest value for them).
- Assign **Agent 2** Item 1 (second highest value for them) and Item 2 (least value conflict).

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one highly valued item according to their preferences.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
