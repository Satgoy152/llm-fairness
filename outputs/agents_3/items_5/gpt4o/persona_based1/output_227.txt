Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  61  12  73  87
1  87  92  27  67  56
2  62  67  31  35  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items and then attempt to allocate the items such that the envy is minimized. Here is the total valuation each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: 42 + 61 + 12 + 73 + 87 = 275
- Agent 1: 87 + 92 + 27 + 67 + 56 = 329
- Agent 2: 62 + 67 + 31 + 35 + 12 = 207

Now, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. Allocate items with the highest value for each agent first:

   - For Agent 0, the highest value items are 4 (87) and 3 (73).
   - For Agent 1, the highest value items are 1 (92) and 0 (87).
   - For Agent 2, the highest value items are 1 (67) and 0 (62).

2. To avoid conflicts, allocate the unique highest valued items to each agent and then the remaining items:

   - Assign item 1 (92) to Agent 1 since it’s their highest value.
   - Assign item 4 (87) to Agent 0 as it’s their highest value.
   - Assign item 2 (31) to Agent 2 to ensure an initial allocation.

3. Allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

   - Assign item 3 (73) to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 (87) to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims at minimizing the envy while ensuring each agent gets an allocation.
