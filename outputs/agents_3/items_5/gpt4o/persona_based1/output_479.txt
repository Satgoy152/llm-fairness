Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  94  80  16  96
1  87  95  86  78  76
2  90  39  55  15  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 95 86 78 76]
 [90 39 55 15 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that every agent receives an integer number of items while adhering to the constraint that exactly 5 items are allocated in total. We'll use a simple allocation method focusing on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [43, 94, 80, 16, 96]
Agent 1: [87, 95, 86, 78, 76]
Agent 2: [90, 39, 55, 15, 19]
```

### Initial Observations:
- **Item 0** is most valuable to Agent 2.
- **Item 1** is most valuable to Agent 1.
- **Item 2** is most valuable to Agent 0.
- **Item 3** is most valuable to Agent 1.
- **Item 4** is most valuable to Agent 0.

Using these observations, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0** is allocated to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 90).
2. **Item 1** is allocated to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 95).
3. **Item 2** is allocated to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 80).
4. **Item 3** is allocated to Agent 1 (second highest valuation: 78).
5. **Item 4** is allocated to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 96).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their most valuable items as much as possible, minimizing envy under the given constraints.

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
