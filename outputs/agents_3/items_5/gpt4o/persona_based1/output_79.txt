Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  24  58   0  37
1  56  42  50  85  83
2   2  11  89  45  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, we'll attempt to find a distribution that satisfies this condition.

Let's review the valuations for each item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0: 58
  - Agent 1: 56
  - Agent 2: 2

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0: 24
  - Agent 1: 42
  - Agent 2: 11

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0: 58
  - Agent 1: 50
  - Agent 2: 89

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0: 0
  - Agent 1: 85
  - Agent 2: 45

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0: 37
  - Agent 1: 83
  - Agent 2: 44

A potential envy-free allocation would involve assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of total value.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 (value 58) has the highest valuation.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 (value 42) has the highest valuation.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 (value 89) has the highest valuation.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 (value 85) has the highest valuation.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 (value 83) has the highest valuation.

Now, we must adjust to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We will check and adjust the allocations to balance the number of items:

- Items 3 and 4 can be reassigned to ensure fairness. 
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as it is the second-highest value for Agent 2 (44), and move item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Item [3]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to respect the envy-freeness criterion as closely as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy among agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
