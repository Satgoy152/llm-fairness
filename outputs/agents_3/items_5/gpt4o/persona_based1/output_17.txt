Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  37  12  34  64
1  57  56  77  24  43
2  12  23  15  42  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, one common approach is to maximize the minimum satisfaction of each agent, ensuring that no agent is envious of another's allocation. We will use the valuations provided in the table to distribute the items accordingly.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [25, 37, 12, 34, 64]
- Agent 1: [57, 56, 77, 24, 43]
- Agent 2: [12, 23, 15, 42, 11]

One reasonable approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, thus aiming for a distribution that reduces envy as much as possible.

Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (57)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (56)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (77)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (42)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (64)

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

1. Assign Item 0, Item 1, and Item 2 to Agent 1. This is because Agent 1 has the highest valuation for each of these items.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 since they have the highest valuation.
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 since they have the highest valuation.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 4.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, which helps in achieving envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
