Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  20  99  64  65
1  57  69  36  61  78
2  11  25  62  43  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives items such that no agent envies another's allocation more than their own. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, which is a common approach for achieving fairness in the absence of envy-freeness.

Let's analyze the valuations and propose a fair allocation:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 40, 20, 99, 64, 65
- **Agent 1:** 57, 69, 36, 61, 78
- **Agent 2:** 11, 25, 62, 43, 15

Analyzing the values, we can use a strategy to ensure each agent gets significant value from their most valued items. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (99).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (78) and item 1 next (69).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 fairly high (62), but agent 0 has a much higher value for it, so we should allocate item 3 to agent 2, which they value decently (43).

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0:** Items 2 (99)
- **Agent 1:** Items 1 (69), 4 (78)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0 (11), 3 (43)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among the highest in their individual preference lists, thus minimizing potential envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
