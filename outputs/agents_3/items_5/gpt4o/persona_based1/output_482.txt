Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1   9  26  90  61
1  30  69  94  12  58
2  51  25  84  93  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider methods that ensure envy-freeness or at least approximate fairness. A common approach is to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [1, 9, 26, 90, 61]
- Agent 1: [30, 69, 94, 12, 58]
- Agent 2: [51, 25, 84, 93, 61]

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly at 93, and no other agent values item 3 as highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest at 94. Since item 3 is already allocated, assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest at 9, but Agent 1 values it more at 69. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 0** values item 4 at 61, the same as Agent 2, but Agent 1 values it at 58. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

5. Lastly, item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 at 51. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize fairness based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
