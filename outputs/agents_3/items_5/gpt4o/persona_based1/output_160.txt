Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  47  52  76  21
1  49  97  63  40   4
2  36  51  94  51  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, I will use a strategy to maximize each agent's total value, aiming for an equitable distribution. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Step 1: Analyze each agent's valuations
- **Agent 0:** Values are [94, 47, 52, 76, 21]
- **Agent 1:** Values are [49, 97, 63, 40, 4]
- **Agent 2:** Values are [36, 51, 94, 51, 11]

### Step 2: Identify the highest-valued items for each agent
- **Agent 0:** Highest value is for item 0 (94)
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 1 (97)
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 2 (94)

### Step 3: Allocate these highest-valued items
- **Agent 0:** Item 0
- **Agent 1:** Item 1
- **Agent 2:** Item 2

### Step 4: Allocate remaining items to minimize envy
Remaining items are 3 and 4.

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0 values item 3 at 76
  - Agent 1 values item 3 at 40
  - Agent 2 values item 3 at 51

  Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as they value it the most.

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0 values item 4 at 21
  - Agent 1 values item 4 at 4
  - Agent 2 values item 4 at 11

  Assign item 4 to Agent 0 or Agent 2, as it minimally impacts overall envy. Assigning to Agent 2 will balance the number of items each agent has.

### Step 5: Finalize allocation
- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 3
- **Agent 1:** Item 1
- **Agent 2:** Items 2 and 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their valuation while attempting to maintain envy-freeness.

    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
