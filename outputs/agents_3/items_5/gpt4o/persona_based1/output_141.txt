Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  95   0  63  85
1  20  46  99  47  97
2  64  33  82  76  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [64 33 82 76 31]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly and in an envy-free manner, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: 8, 95, 0, 63, 85
- Agent 1 values the items as: 20, 46, 99, 47, 97
- Agent 2 values the items as: 64, 33, 82, 76, 31

The goal is to allocate all 5 items so that each agent gets an integer number of items without causing envy.

One approach is to use the method of maximizing each agent's utility for the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies the allocation of others.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (value 99) and item 4 (value 97). Allocating these items to Agent 1 maximizes their happiness and minimizes envy from others since these items are highly valued by Agent 1.
   
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (value 95) and item 3 (value 63). Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their utility and avoids envy since they value these items much more than the others do.

3. **Agent 2** will receive the remaining item, item 0 (value 64), which is valued the highest among the remaining items for Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 4].
- Agent 2 receives item [0].

The allocations are fair because each agent receives the items they most highly value given the remaining options, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

### JSON Allocation Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
