Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  86   7  99  81
1  40  92  95  23  22
2  42  17  55  61   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 3 (99). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (95). 
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 significantly (61), but given Agent 0's higher valuation, they might have to settle for their second-highest valued item, which is item 0 (42).

Let's try to allocate items based on these observations:

- Assign item 3 to **Agent 0** because it has the highest valuation for Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to **Agent 1** because it has the highest valuation for Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to **Agent 2** because it's the highest available option after allocating item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, we have items 1 and 4 remaining. We'll assign these based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while maintaining envy-freeness:

- Assign item 1 to **Agent 0** (value 86 for Agent 0, which is higher than other agents' valuations for item 1).
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 1** (value 22 for Agent 1, which is higher than Agent 2's value for the same item).

This allocation seems fair and envy-free based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 0

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
