Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  25  53  92  47
1  18  25  36  87   1
2  90  15   3  90  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the agents' valuations for each item and try to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share. One method to achieve this is to maximize each agent's perceived value of the bundle they receive, considering their own valuations.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. However, item 3 is crucial because it has the highest valuation for both Agent 0 and Agent 2. Since Agent 0 values item 3 the highest among all items, it makes sense to allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations compared to others, but item 3 has the highest value to them. Since item 3 is allocated to Agent 0 due to its high value for them, we should focus on Agent 1's next highest values, which are item 2 and item 1. Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 makes sense since Agent 0 and Agent 2 have lower valuations for it.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 and 3. Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, we allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them and is unallocated.

4. After allocating items 3 and 0, we have items 2 and 4 remaining. Assigning item 4 to Agent 0 gives them a fair allocation since they value it more than Agent 1 and Agent 2. This leaves item 2, which we allocate to Agent 1, as it is their highest remaining valued item.

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items that provide them significant value based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
