Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  99  68  25  49
1  50  35  52  52  42
2  62  31  79  39  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. This means each agent should receive items such that no agent prefers another's allocation to their own, given the valuations.

We have three agents (0, 1, 2) and five items (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The goal is to distribute these items so that each agent feels they received a fair share. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.
   - Agent 0: 39 + 99 + 68 + 25 + 49 = 280
   - Agent 1: 50 + 35 + 52 + 52 + 42 = 231
   - Agent 2: 62 + 31 + 79 + 39 + 14 = 225

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Identify which items each agent values the most and try to allocate those items to them.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (99) and item 2 (68).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (52) and item 2 (52).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (79) and item 0 (62).

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Start with item 2, which is highly valued by all agents, but most by Agent 2. Allocate it to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, who values it the highest.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it's their second-highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their third-highest valued item, and no other agent strongly prefers it.

4. **Check for Fairness and Adjust**:
   - Ensure that the chosen allocation leaves no agent feeling they would prefer another allocation given their valuations.
   - Since each agent receives items that they value highly, this allocation is relatively fair.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
This allocation attempts to respect the preferences of the agents as much as possible given their valuations and the constraint of having five items to distribute.
