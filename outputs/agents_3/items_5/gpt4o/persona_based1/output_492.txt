Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  45  56  28  64
1  94  11  43  91  62
2  46  61  26  64  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to balance the total value allocated to each agent as evenly as possible. We can use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this.

1. **Valuations Matrix:**

   | Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
   |-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | 0     | 53     | 45     | 56     | 28     | 64     |
   | 1     | 94     | 11     | 43     | 91     | 62     |
   | 2     | 46     | 61     | 26     | 64     | 55     |

2. **Total Valuations for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 53 + 45 + 56 + 28 + 64 = 246
   - Agent 1: 94 + 11 + 43 + 91 + 62 = 301
   - Agent 2: 46 + 61 + 26 + 64 + 55 = 252

3. **Greedy Allocation Approach:**

   We'll allocate items to agents such that their total valuation is as balanced as possible. We will start by allocating the items that are valued most by each agent.

4. **Allocation Steps:**

   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (94). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 4 the most (64). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values Item 3 the most (64). Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 the next most (91), but it is already taken. Agent 1 values Item 4 the next most (62), but it is already taken. The next highest is Item 2 (43). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 the next most (61). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.

5. **Final Allocations:**

   - Agent 0: {4}
   - Agent 1: {0, 2}
   - Agent 2: {1, 3}

6. **Check Total Allocations:**

   - Total Items Allocated: 5
   - All items are allocated.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.
