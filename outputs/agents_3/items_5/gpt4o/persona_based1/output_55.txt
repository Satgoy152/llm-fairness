Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  13  34  56  31
1  36   1  53  72  68
2  86   2  40  21  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we can consider various fair division methods. Given the valuations from the table, a possible way to allocate the items is by maximizing each agent's total utility while ensuring that no agent envies another significantly. 

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest value item to each agent first:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (value: 56).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value: 72).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value: 86).

2. **Avoid conflicts by giving unique high-value items to each agent:**
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1 since it is their highest value and the highest among all agents.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2 since it is more valuable to them than item 3.
   - Agent 0 gets item 2, since it is the next highest value for them after item 3.

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Item 4 has high value for agent 1, assign it to them.
   - Item 1 has low value across the board, assign it to agent 0 to balance their allocation.

Following this strategy, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and we aim to balance the perceived value received by each agent as closely as possible to minimize envy.
