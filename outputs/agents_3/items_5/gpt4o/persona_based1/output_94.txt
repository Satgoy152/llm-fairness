Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  13  63  28   7
1   4  22  89  64  12
2   9  52  72  69  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution if possible, or at least a fair allocation where no agent feels significantly disadvantaged. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify total valuations for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 45 + 13 + 63 + 28 + 7 = 156
   - Agent 1: 4 + 22 + 89 + 64 + 12 = 191
   - Agent 2: 9 + 52 + 72 + 69 + 67 = 269

2. **Begin with high-value items**:
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (89), and Agent 2 values it at 72. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 is valued highly by Agent 2 (69) and moderately by Agent 1 (64). Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute remaining items**:
   - Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (45). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 2 (52). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (67). Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Check allocation fairness**:
   - Agent 0 has Item 0.
   - Agent 1 has Item 2.
   - Agent 2 has Items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it does provide a distribution where each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
