Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  63  58  23  41
1  12  72  51   4  14
2  61  39  55  85  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. We will use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum gain to achieve a fair division. Here's a possible way to approach this problem:

1. **Understand the Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values: [54, 63, 58, 23, 41]
   - Agent 1 values: [12, 72, 51, 4, 14]
   - Agent 2 values: [61, 39, 55, 85, 44]

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - To begin, let's identify high-value items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a manner that balances the overall gain for each agent.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation**:
   - **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this item the most (85), so it is allocated to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most (72), so it is allocated to Agent 1.
   - **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item the most (61), but since Agent 2 already has a high-value item, let's allocate it to Agent 0 who also highly values it (54).
   - **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item (58) and has already received one item. However, Agent 2 values it (55) and hasn't received many items. Let's allocate it to Agent 2.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this item (44), but Agent 0 values it highest among remaining options (41), so let's allocate it to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3.

This allocation attempts to maximize the minimum gain for each agent and tries to minimize envy. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
