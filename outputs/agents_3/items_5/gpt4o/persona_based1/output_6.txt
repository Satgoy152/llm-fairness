Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  41  52  63  26
1  38  51  73  65   4
2  87  81  64  87  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation given their own valuation of the items.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [82, 41, 52, 63, 26]
- Agent 1: [38, 51, 73, 65, 4]
- Agent 2: [87, 81, 64, 87, 20]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (87).

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (81).

3. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (73).

4. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Highest valuation is shared by Agent 2 (87) and Agent 0 (63). Since Agent 2 already has two items with high value, allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Allocate Item 4:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (26).

By examining the valuations, we can distribute the items to ensure a fair division:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation aims to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives items with high personal value. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of assigning all 5 items and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the provided valuations.
