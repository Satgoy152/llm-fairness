Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  20  90  61  14
1   0  39  94  67  18
2  18   3  86  11  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This is known as an envy-free allocation. 

To achieve this, we can use an approach to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring that the total number of items allocated sums to 5. Given the values provided, we can attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances the total value for each agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 57, 20, 90, 61, 14
- Agent 1 values: 0, 39, 94, 67, 18
- Agent 2 values: 18, 3, 86, 11, 99

One possible envy-free allocation could be:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (one of the highest values for Agent 1)
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0)
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively highly valued by them, reducing the likelihood of envy.

Here's the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's value from the items they receive while using all 5 items.
