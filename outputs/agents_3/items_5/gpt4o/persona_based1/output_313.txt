Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  17  47  37  29
1  63  75  53  19  30
2  27  40  10  69  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 75 53 19 30]
 [27 40 10 69 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we'll consider the valuations given for each agent. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly.

### Valuations Matrix:
- Agent 0: [63, 17, 47, 37, 29]
- Agent 1: [63, 75, 53, 19, 30]
- Agent 2: [27, 40, 10, 69, 32]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (75) and no other agent values any item higher than this. So, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (69) with no other higher competing valuation. So, allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (63), tied with Agent 1. Since Agent 1 already has item 1, assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. For the remaining items (2 and 4), assign them based on maximizing individual agent's satisfaction while also considering balance:
   - **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 53, which is the highest valuation among the remaining unallocated items. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 32, which is the highest remaining valuation for Agent 2. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
