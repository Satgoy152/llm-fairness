Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  69  90  70  49
1  75   7  94  77  87
2  49  17  72  43  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming to minimize envy, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them so that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their preferences. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (90) and 3 (70).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (94) the most and also has relatively high valuations for items 0 (75) and 4 (87).
   - Agent 2 has moderate to low valuations across items, with item 2 (72) being the highest relative to their other valuations.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - To minimize envy, we need to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly.
   - Let's try to allocate item 2, which is highly valued by all agents, to Agent 1 since they value it the most.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they also have a high valuation for it.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it maximizes their satisfaction.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their third-highest valuation.
   - This leaves Agent 2 with no items due to their generally lower valuations compared to other agents' preferences.

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2, and 4
   - Agent 2: No items

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value significantly while minimizing potential envy based on their valuations.
