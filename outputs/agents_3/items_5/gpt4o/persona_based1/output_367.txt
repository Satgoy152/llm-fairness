Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  19  60  34  87
1  27  96   3  51  58
2  15  33  37  43  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can try to ensure that each agent receives items that are of high value to them according to their valuation. Our goal is to create an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (value 87) and item 2 (value 60). Let's allocate those to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (value 96) and item 3 (value 51). Let's allocate those to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** is left with item 0, which has a value of 15 for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among the highest in their valuation table, reducing potential envy.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total of 5 items is allocated.
