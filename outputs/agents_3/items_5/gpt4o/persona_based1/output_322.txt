Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  76  86  88  44
1  92  77  25  86  76
2  26  77  20  29  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility (also known as max-min fairness), which seeks to ensure the least well-off agent receives the best possible bundle of items according to their valuations. This approach helps achieve a fair division and aims to minimize envy among agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 12 + 76 + 86 + 88 + 44 = 306
- Agent 1: 92 + 77 + 25 + 86 + 76 = 356
- Agent 2: 26 + 77 + 20 + 29 + 67 = 219

Next, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences. We will try to allocate items by focusing on critical items that provide high utility for each agent while taking into account the total utility.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 3).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 0).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 4).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value for item 1 after Agent 1).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value for item 2 after Agent 1).

This allocation aims to balance the value received by each agent and minimize envy. Hereâ€™s how the allocations look:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3 for a total value of 86 + 88 = 174.
- Agent 1 receives item 0 for a total value of 92.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4 for a total value of 77 + 67 = 144.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation strategy considers the relative valuations each agent places on items and attempts to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the total value.
