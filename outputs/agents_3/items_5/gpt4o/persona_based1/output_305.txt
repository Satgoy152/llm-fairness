Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  94  81  46  68
1  81  48   5  64  68
2  21  52  79  14  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we want to allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the integer constraints. We have 3 agents and 5 items, which means each agent should get at least one item, but one agent will receive two items due to the total number of items being odd.

Here's one possible way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 0, 1, and 2 highly. To maximize fairness, we should try to give them one of these items.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 highly, but they also have a reasonable valuation for item 3 and item 4. We should aim to allocate one of these items to them.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the highest, so we should give them this item. However, since Agent 0 also values item 2 highly, we need to consider the overall fairness and envy-freeness of the allocation.

Taking these considerations into account, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 3

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
