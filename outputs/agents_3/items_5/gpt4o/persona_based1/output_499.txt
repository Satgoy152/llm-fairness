Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  66  78  25  76
1   2  42  49  18  13
2  33  10  81  25  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to consider the agents' valuations in a manner that approximates envy-freeness as closely as possible. This means trying to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their perceived value of the items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [70, 66, 78, 25, 76]
Agent 1: [ 2, 42, 49, 18, 13]
Agent 2: [33, 10, 81, 25, 63]
```

A reasonable approach is to allocate the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, while also ensuring each agent receives a fair overall allocation. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 2 (81) and moderately by Agent 0 (78), but since Agent 2 has the highest valuation, it's reasonable to allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 0 (70), so it's a good candidate for Agent 0.

3. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 0 (66), so it can also go to Agent 0.

4. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 0 (76), but Agent 2 also values it (63). Since Agent 0 already has two items, let's consider fairness and allocate it to Agent 2.

5. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 1 (18), so it should go to Agent 1 to ensure they receive something they value.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
