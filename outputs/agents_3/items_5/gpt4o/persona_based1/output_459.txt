Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  87  52  16  86
1  55  99  96  21  13
2  60  13  95  13  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and try to ensure a proportional distribution of value. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. **Agent Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [17, 87, 52, 16, 86]
   - Agent 1: [55, 99, 96, 21, 13]
   - Agent 2: [60, 13, 95, 13, 53]

2. **Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 17 + 87 + 52 + 16 + 86 = 258
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 55 + 99 + 96 + 21 + 13 = 284
   - Total value for Agent 2 = 60 + 13 + 95 + 13 + 53 = 234

3. **Proportional Share:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive items totaling approximately one-third of their total valuation.

4. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating items based on the highest individual valuations for each agent to ensure each agent gets a portion of the items they value highly.

5. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 (value 87) to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 (value 96) to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 0 (value 60) to Agent 2.

6. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 3 and 4 need allocation. Consider remaining high valuations.
   - Allocate item 4 (value 86) to Agent 0, as it's their second-highest valued item.
   - Allocate item 3 (value 21) to Agent 1.

7. **Review:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 4] with total value 173.
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3] with total value 117.
   - Agent 2: Item [0] with total value 60.

The final allocations aim to balance the value each agent receives relative to their total valuations, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
