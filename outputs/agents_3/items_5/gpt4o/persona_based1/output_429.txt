Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  71  35  51  58
1  56   8  22  10  92
2  53  58   8  18  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent feels they receive a fair share.

One approach to achieving this is to use a method similar to the "maximum Nash welfare" solution, which attempts to find an allocation that balances the product of the valuations across agents. This method often results in envy-free allocations when such an allocation exists.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [40, 71, 35, 51, 58]
Agent 1: [56,  8, 22, 10, 92]
Agent 2: [53, 58,  8, 18, 57]
```

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (71), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (92), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (53), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated 3 items. We need to allocate 2 more items and try to balance the remaining allocations:

4. Agent 0's remaining highest valued item is item 4, but it is already allocated. The next highest valued item is item 3 (51), which is unallocated. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. For the last item, item 2, Agent 0 values it the most (35), but Agent 2 has it as their third highest preference (8) and would benefit from receiving another item. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

After allocation, this is how it looks:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, taking into account the highest preferences of the agents to the extent possible. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
