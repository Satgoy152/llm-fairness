Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  75  50  10  79
1  25  82  98  47  55
2  57   0  59  63  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received the best possible set of items according to their valuations. Since there are 5 items and 3 agents, at least one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each, or one agent will receive 3 items and one agent will receive 2 items, and the last will receive none. 

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  75  50  10  79
1  25  82  98  47  55
2  57   0  59  63  57
```

We can summarize the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0: 31 + 75 + 50 + 10 + 79 = 245
- Agent 1: 25 + 82 + 98 + 47 + 55 = 307
- Agent 2: 57 + 0 + 59 + 63 + 57 = 236

To ensure fairness, let's prioritize items based on the highest individual valuation for each item. We'll start by allocating the highest valued items to the corresponding agents:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (57)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (82)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (98)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (63)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (79)

Now, let's allocate based on ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it the most)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0

At this point, Agent 0 has one item, Agent 1 has two items, and Agent 2 has one item. One item remains, Item 3, which is valued highest by Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another, as their highest valued items are with them.

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
