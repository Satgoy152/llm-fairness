Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57   5  43  76  37
1  18  31   9  78  46
2  45  12  66  17  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 31  9 78 46]
 [45 12 66 17 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction and maintains envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the table of valuations, a straightforward approach is to use a method that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items.

Here are the valuations for each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [57, 5, 43, 76, 37]
- Agent 1: [18, 31, 9, 78, 46]
- Agent 2: [45, 12, 66, 17, 82]

Let's follow a procedure to allocate the items:

1. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (78), so Item 3 is allocated to Agent 1.
2. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (82), so Item 4 is allocated to Agent 2.
3. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (57), so Item 0 is allocated to Agent 0.
4. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (66), so Item 2 is allocated to Agent 2.
5. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (31), so Item 1 is allocated to Agent 1.

Now, we have ensured that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Agent 0 receives one item, Agent 1 receives two items, and Agent 2 receives two items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
