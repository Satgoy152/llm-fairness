Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  59   2  39  64
1  59   4   0  48  94
2  63  95  66  26  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuations while ensuring envy-freeness. Given the valuations provided, the goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Here is a step-by-step approach to determine a fair allocation:

1. **List the items with the highest valuation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 64.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 94.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 95.

2. **Check for possible allocations to maximize total valuation and minimize envy:**
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they value it the highest.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they value it the highest and it is the most valuable item for them.
   - For agent 0, assign item 0, which is their second highest valued item.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it significantly (48).
   - Lastly, assign item 2 to agent 0, as it has minimal value and doesn't cause significant envy (agent 1 values it at 0).

3. **Check for envy-freeness:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, valued at 28 and 2, respectively.
   - Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4, valued at 48 and 94, respectively.
   - Agent 2 receives item 1, valued at 95.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution minimizes envy given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation balances the total valuations and attempts to satisfy each agent according to their preferences.
