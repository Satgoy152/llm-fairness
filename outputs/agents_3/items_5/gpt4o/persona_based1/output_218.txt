Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  84  15  98  59
1  47  79  47  56  14
2  53  37  30  44  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives, aiming for a distribution that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

The agents' valuations for each item are as follows:

- Agent 0: [97, 84, 15, 98, 59]
- Agent 1: [47, 79, 47, 56, 14]
- Agent 2: [53, 37, 30, 44, 19]

We need to assign each item to one of the three agents such that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it equally with Agent 0 at 47.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 59.

We need to ensure that items are distributed fairly. If we assign highly valued items to agents who value them the most, we might end up with an uneven distribution. Instead, we should aim for a balanced distribution.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0** receives item 3 (value 98) and item 1 (value 84).
- **Agent 1** receives item 2 (value 47) and item 4 (value 14).
- **Agent 2** receives item 0 (value 53).

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent gets at least one item.
- The allocation is relatively balanced based on the highest preference of agents.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
