Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  82   9  40  55
1   7  68  19  34  56
2  65  85  31  40  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, though achieving strict envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent values their portion highly, minimizing potential envy.

Let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 85, followed by item 1 at 82.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 68, followed by item 4 at 56.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 85, followed by item 0 at 65.

Considering these preferences, we can try to allocate items to balance total value perceived by each agent:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 places a high value on item 0 (65), which is also a significant value for Agent 0, but Agent 0 has other high-value items.
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 82, which is the highest remaining value for any agent after item 0 is assigned.
3. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: This is the highest value remaining for Agent 1 (56).
4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2**: This balances the allocations by giving Agent 2 another valued item (40), which matches Agent 0's value.
5. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: This item is not highly valued by any agent, but giving it to Agent 0 helps balance the total number of items.

This allocation is an attempt to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
