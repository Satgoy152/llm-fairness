Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  86  46  55  12
1  17  14  66  48  56
2  37   9   8  40  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a manner that is fair and minimizes envy, we can use a strategy called the "maximum sum" method. This involves allocating items in a way that each agent receives the items that provide them with the greatest total value, given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent gets for different combinations of item allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest values are for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 2.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 3.

By assigning these items initially, we can then consider the remaining items:

- Remaining Items: [4]
- Agent 0 has the lowest remaining value for item 4 compared to others, so we should consider giving it to Agent 2 to balance the allocation.

Based on this, a possible fair allocation that minimizes envy is:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1:** Gets item [2]
- **Agent 2:** Gets items [3, 4]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed fairly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
