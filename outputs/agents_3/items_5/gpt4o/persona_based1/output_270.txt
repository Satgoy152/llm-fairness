Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63   0  58  81  29
1   5   6  11  10  36
2  28  33  62  34  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63  0 58 81 29]
 [ 5  6 11 10 36]
 [28 33 62 34 70]]
Output:
To find a fair allocation of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. This can be achieved through an envy-free or at least envy-minimized allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [63, 0, 58, 81, 29]
Agent 1: [5, 6, 11, 10, 36]
Agent 2: [28, 33, 62, 34, 70]
```

The goal is to allocate all 5 items to these 3 agents in a way that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0, 2, and 3. We should prioritize giving them these items as they have the highest valuations for them.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent's highest valuation is for item 4. They should receive item 4 as it provides them the most value.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 2 and 4 but since item 4 goes to agent 1, we can allocate item 1 to agent 2 as they value it more than agent 1 does.

### Detailed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest priorities: Item 3 (81) and Item 0 (63). These items should go to agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest priority: Item 4 (36). This should go to agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest priority after agent 0 takes item 3: Item 2 (62), and since item 1 is not yet taken, and valued at 33 by agent 2, it can be allocated to them.

### Final Allocation:

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 2

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
