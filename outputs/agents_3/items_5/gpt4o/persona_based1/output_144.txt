Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83   3  36  84  98
1  57  59  61  76  21
2  67  44  63   6  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. Given the nature of the problem and the table provided, we can use the "round-robin" method or "sequential allocation" to ensure that each agent gets their preferred available item in turns.

Let's consider the agents' preferences based on their valuations:

- Agent 0's highest preferences in descending order of value are: 4, 3, 0, 2, 1.
- Agent 1's highest preferences in descending order of value are: 3, 2, 1, 0, 4.
- Agent 2's highest preferences in descending order of value are: 2, 0, 1, 4, 3.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 98).
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 76).
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 63).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 83).
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 59).
   - Agent 2 has no items left to pick.

After the allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that reflects their preferences as closely as possible, given the constraints.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
