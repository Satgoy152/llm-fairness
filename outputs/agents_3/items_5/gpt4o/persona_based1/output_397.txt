Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  79  58  37  96
1  22   8  65  99   9
2  41  97  65  43  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their valuations. Given the valuation matrix, we aim to distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Let's examine the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Values: [10, 79, 58, 37, 96]

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Values: [22, 8, 65, 99, 9]

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Values: [41, 97, 65, 43, 22]

One possible approach to solve this is to allocate items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, ensuring that no agent envies another:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Highest value is by Agent 2 (41)
- **Item 1:**
  - Highest value is by Agent 2 (97)
- **Item 2:**
  - Highest value is by Agent 1 (65)
- **Item 3:**
  - Highest value is by Agent 1 (99)
- **Item 4:**
  - Highest value is by Agent 0 (96)

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, thus maintaining envy-freeness to the best extent possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
