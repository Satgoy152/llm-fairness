Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  52   9  78  90
1  73  99  37  69  29
2  54   4  73  57  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Let's evaluate the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [2, 52, 9, 78, 90]
- **Agent 1**: [73, 99, 37, 69, 29]
- **Agent 2**: [54, 4, 73, 57, 11]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (73), next by Agent 2 (54), and lastly by Agent 0 (2).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99), next by Agent 0 (52), and lastly by Agent 2 (4).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (73), next by Agent 1 (37), and lastly by Agent 0 (9).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (78), next by Agent 1 (69), and lastly by Agent 2 (57).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (90), next by Agent 1 (29), and lastly by Agent 2 (11).

### Allocation Result:
We'll try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for items 3 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2.

Given these preferences, a fair allocation could be:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 2

This distribution ensures that each agent receives their most valued items where possible, and the total number of items allocated is 5.

### Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
