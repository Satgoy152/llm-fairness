Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  94   4  23  44
1  68  36  66   7  61
2  87  37  53  60  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent**: This is the sum of the agent's valuations for all items.

    - Agent 0: \( 14 + 94 + 4 + 23 + 44 = 179 \)
    - Agent 1: \( 68 + 36 + 66 + 7 + 61 = 238 \)
    - Agent 2: \( 87 + 37 + 53 + 60 + 15 = 252 \)

2. **Calculate Each Agent's Share of Total Value**: Ideally, each agent should receive a share of the total value proportional to their total valuation.

3. **Allocate Items Using a Greedy Approach**: Start by assigning each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

4. **Adjust Allocations to Satisfy Fairness**: Ensure that no agent envies another by trying to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations.

Let's go through the allocations:

- Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item:
  - Agent 0: Item 1 (94)
  - Agent 1: Item 0 (68)
  - Agent 2: Item 3 (60)

- Proceed to allocate the remaining items:
  - Remaining items: 2, 4.
  - Agent 0 has their highest valued item (94), next highest is item 4 (44).
  - Agent 1 next highest is item 4 (61), but assigning to Agent 1 would cause envy from Agent 0.
  - Agent 2 next highest is item 2 (53).

- Balance the remaining allocations to minimize envy:
  - Agent 1 gets item 4.
  - Agent 2 gets item 2.

- Ensure all items are allocated, and no agent is envious of another.

Final allocations, attempting to maintain a balance and minimize envy:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy, given the constraints of integer allocations.
