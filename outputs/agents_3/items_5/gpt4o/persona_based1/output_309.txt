Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  22  73  43  12
1  42  59  16  95  32
2  51  23  66  40   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items accordingly. Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 98 
  - Item 1: 22 
  - Item 2: 73 
  - Item 3: 43 
  - Item 4: 12

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 16
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 32

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 40
  - Item 4: 2

To construct an envy-free allocation, we need to consider the highest-valued items for each agent, and try to distribute the overall value fairly.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (98) and item 2 (73).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (95) and item 1 (59).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (66) and item 0 (51).

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Give Agent 0 item 0.
- Give Agent 1 item 3.
- Give Agent 2 item 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 4) while maintaining fairness:

- Agent 0 can take item 1 (Agent 0 values it more than Agent 2 does).
- Agent 1 can take item 4 (This item has relatively low value, and Agent 1 already has a high-value item).

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value, and no agent envies another's allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
