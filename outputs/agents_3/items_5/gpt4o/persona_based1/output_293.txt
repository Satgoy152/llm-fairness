Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  24  47  34  34
1   9  71  39  89  17
2  40  55  35  19  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or near envy-free distribution based on the agents' valuations. Here is how we can think about the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (47)
   - Other high valuations: Item 3 (34), Item 4 (34)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (89)
   - Other high valuations: Item 1 (71), Item 2 (39)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (40)
   - Other high valuations: Item 1 (55), Item 2 (35)

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0**: Best suited for Agent 2 (valuation 40) since it is their highest valued item.
- **Item 1**: Best suited for Agent 1 (valuation 71) since it is their second-highest valued item and higher than what others offer.
- **Item 2**: Best suited for Agent 0 (valuation 47) since it is their highest valued item.
- **Item 3**: Best suited for Agent 1 (valuation 89) as it is their highest valued item.
- **Item 4**: Since Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value item 4 equally (34 and 17 respectively), and Agent 0 already has one item, it is logical to give this item to Agent 0 to balance the number of items each agent receives.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation balances the number of items and attempts to respect the highest valuations for each agent as much as possible.
