Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  46  21  21  65
1  90  93   4  53  11
2  54  53  43  60  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[40 46 21 21 65]
 [90 93  4 53 11]
 [54 53 43 60 54]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that can be considered envy-free (or at least minimizing envy), we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to allocate all items such that no agent feels another agent has received a better allocation according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [40, 46, 21, 21, 65]
- Agent 1: [90, 93, 4, 53, 11]
- Agent 2: [54, 53, 43, 60, 54]

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Highest Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (65).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (93).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (60).

2. **Fair Allocation Goal**:
   - Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Assign the highest valued item for each agent based on their preferences, and then distribute the remaining items to balance the total value as evenly as possible.

**Item Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Items [4, 2]
  - Total valuation: 65 (Item 4) + 21 (Item 2) = 86
- Agent 1: Items [1]
  - Total valuation: 93 (Item 1)
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]
  - Total valuation: 54 (Item 0) + 60 (Item 3) = 114

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by allowing each agent to receive their highest valued item, and distributes remaining items to keep valuations balanced.

Here is the proposed allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
