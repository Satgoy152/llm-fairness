Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  16  49  89  59
1  16  16  83  55  54
2  77  22  18  78  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 16 83 55 54]
 [77 22 18 78 94]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, ensuring no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We will use the valuations provided in the table to guide our allocation process.

### Valuations Table:

- **Agent 0:** [37, 16, 49, 89, 59]
- **Agent 1:** [16, 16, 83, 55, 54]
- **Agent 2:** [77, 22, 18, 78, 94]

### Strategy for Fair Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valued Items:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 most (89).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 most (83).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 most (94).

2. **Allocate High-Valued Items:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0 and 1 are left to be allocated.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly (77), and Agent 0 values item 0 second highest (37). 
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Item 1 is valued equally by Agents 0 and 1, but Agent 0 has fewer items allocated so far and values it higher than their other options. 
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 3
- **Agent 1:** Item 2
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers their preferences to minimize envy.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly according to the agents' valuations and that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others.
