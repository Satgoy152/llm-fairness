Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  11  49  20  72
1  20   7  69  48   5
2  30  88  53  87  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to find an allocation that attempts to minimize envy. One classic approach is the Envy-Free (EF) allocation where each agent feels they have the best allocation given their valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations for each item and try to ensure that each agent gets a fair share:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are [55, 20, 30].
  - Agent 0 values this item the most.

- **Item 1**: Valuations are [11, 7, 88].
  - Agent 2 values this item the most.

- **Item 2**: Valuations are [49, 69, 53].
  - Agent 1 values this item the most.

- **Item 3**: Valuations are [20, 48, 87].
  - Agent 2 values this item the most.

- **Item 4**: Valuations are [72, 5, 89].
  - Agent 2 values this item the most.

Agent 2 has high valuations for several items. To distribute fairly while minimizing envy across agents, we can allocate based on maximizing each agent's value for at least some items:

1. **Allocate items based on highest values**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 0.
   - Agent 1 receives item 2.
   - Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

Now let's verify that this allocation is fair and minimizes envy:
- Agent 0 gets item 0 which they value at 55, and this is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 gets item 2 which they value at 69, and this is their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 3, and 4 which they value at (88, 87, and 89) respectively. They value these items collectively higher than any single item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value significantly, minimizing potential envy among them. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
