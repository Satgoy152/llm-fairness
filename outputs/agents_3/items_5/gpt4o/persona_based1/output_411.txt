Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  18  63  74   5
1  75   9  24  67  85
2  48  30  53  68  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75  9 24 67 85]
 [48 30 53 68 58]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy by considering the valuations of each agent for each item. One effective method for achieving this is to use an envy-free approach, which tries to ensure that no agent prefers another agentâ€™s allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [96, 18, 63, 74, 5]
Agent 1: [75, 9, 24, 67, 85]
Agent 2: [48, 30, 53, 68, 58]
```

We can use a heuristic approach to allocate items in such a way that the total value each agent receives is roughly balanced, while also considering the possibility of minimizing envy.

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 0:** The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (96). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (30). Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2:** The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (63). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (74). Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (85). Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items while distributing the items fairly.

### Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.
