Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  67  49  46   4
1  90  14  76  75  98
2  93  83  63  73  21
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. 

First, let's summarize the values each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0: Items' values are [13, 67, 49, 46, 4]
- Agent 1: Items' values are [90, 14, 76, 75, 98]
- Agent 2: Items' values are [93, 83, 63, 73, 21]

A fair division that minimizes envy can be approached by allocating items to the agent that values them the most. Let's proceed with this heuristic:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0: 13
   - Agent 1: 90
   - Agent 2: 93
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 67
   - Agent 1: 14
   - Agent 2: 83
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 49
   - Agent 1: 76
   - Agent 2: 63
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 46
   - Agent 1: 75
   - Agent 2: 73
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 4
   - Agent 1: 98
   - Agent 2: 21
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

Now, let's compile the allocations:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, which helps reduce potential envy. 

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
