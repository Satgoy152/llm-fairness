Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  16  41  84  74
1  53  18  34  85  41
2  98   6  65  47  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations as provided, we need to consider a fair division ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. One way to approach this is by maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that no agent envies another's share more than their own.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values are: [79, 16, 41, 84, 74]
   - Highest values are for items 3, 0, and 4.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values are: [53, 18, 34, 85, 41]
   - Highest values are for items 3, 0, and 2.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values are: [98, 6, 65, 47, 17]
   - Highest values are for items 0, 2, and 3.
   
Considering each agent's highest values, we can allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4] (total value = 79 + 74 = 153)
- **Agent 1**: Item [3] (total value = 85)
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2] (total value = 6 + 65 = 71)

This allocation maximizes each agent's valuations given the constraints that only these specific 5 items can be allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
