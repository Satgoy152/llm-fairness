Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  31  79  79  78
1  12  57  23  63  98
2  53  98  68  68  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 57 23 63 98]
 [53 98 68 68 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we seek an allocation that respects the agents' valuations and attempts to create an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation to their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [26, 31, 79, 79, 78]
Agent 1: [12, 57, 23, 63, 98]
Agent 2: [53, 98, 68, 68, 30]
```

Let's analyze the allocation:

1. **Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (98).** Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (98).** Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 2 and 3 (79 each).** Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.
4. Lastly, assign the remaining item 0. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (53), so assign item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]

This allocation respects high valuations and is an attempt to be envy-free, given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
