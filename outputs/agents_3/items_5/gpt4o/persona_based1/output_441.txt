Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  98  31  25  41
1  12  13  97  46  25
2  28  69   5  99  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations. One approach is to maximize the minimum satisfaction (min-max fairness) while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 41

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 46
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 5
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 56

Based on these valuations, we can consider the following allocation strategy:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 91, highest for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 98, highest for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 97, highest for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 99, highest for Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 56, second-highest for Agent 2).

This allocation respects the preferences of each agent by giving them items they value highly, and it ensures that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
