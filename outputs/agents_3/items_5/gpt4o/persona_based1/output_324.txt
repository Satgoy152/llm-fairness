Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  81  77  85  58
1  32  36  62  88  74
2  86  51  69   4  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to use the method of "Envy-Free Allocation," where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 49 + 81 + 77 + 85 + 58 = 350
- Agent 1: 32 + 36 + 62 + 88 + 74 = 292
- Agent 2: 86 + 51 + 69 + 4 + 92 = 302

Next, we need to allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations. A reasonable starting point is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 86)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 81)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 77)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 88)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (value 92)

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2] with total value = 81 + 77 = 158
- Agent 1: Item [3] with total value = 88
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4] with total value = 86 + 92 = 178

This allocation gives each agent a set of items they highly value, reducing envy. While not perfectly envy-free, it is a balanced allocation given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
