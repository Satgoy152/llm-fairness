Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  82  85  32  25
1  11  48  45  35   9
2  27  19  23  15  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:
- Agent 0 values items as: [97, 82, 85, 32, 25]
- Agent 1 values items as: [11, 48, 45, 35, 9]
- Agent 2 values items as: [27, 19, 23, 15, 19]

A possible fair allocation strategy is to start by allocating the most valued items to the agents who value them the most, and then proceed with remaining items while ensuring that the allocation remains envy-free.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 97. No other agent values it as highly.
2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 also values item 1 very highly at 82, more than any other agent.
3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 2 at 85, which is again the highest valuation for this item.
4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 3 at 35, which is the highest among all agents for this item.
5. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 4 at 19, which is the highest valuation for this item.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2, as they have the highest valuation for these items.
- Agent 1 receives item 3, which they value highest among the remaining items.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, which they value highest among the remaining items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, reducing envy among agents.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
