Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  99  19  16  37
1  34  86  89  37  57
2  33  68  99  51  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. One approach to achieve this is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) each agent receives.

First, let's list the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: [52, 99, 19, 16, 37]
- Agent 1: [34, 86, 89, 37, 57]
- Agent 2: [33, 68, 99, 51, 49]

To allocate the items, we'll try to distribute them such that the product of the valuations is maximized and that the distribution is as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most, but it's better assigned to Agent 1 to maximize the MNW.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it the second highest.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Following this logic, we arrive at the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]

This distribution aims to balance the valuations and maximize the Nash product, ensuring the allocation is relatively fair.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
