Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  1  41  58   6  13
1  1  17  25  86  37
2  8  78  36  32  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method such as the "round robin" approach. This approach is typically used when the goal is to ensure each participant gets a fair share based on their individual preferences.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [1, 41, 58, 6, 13]  
Agent 1: [1, 17, 25, 86, 37]  
Agent 2: [8, 78, 36, 32, 52]  

We can proceed by allocating the items in rounds, where each agent picks their most valued item that is still available. We'll assume agents pick in the order 0, 1, 2, and repeat until all items are allocated.

**Round 1:**
- Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 58)
- Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 86)
- Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 78)

**Remaining items:** [0, 4]

**Round 2:**
- Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 13)
- Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 1)

Agent 2 does not get to pick in the second round as there are no items left, ensuring each item is assigned.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [3, 0]
- Agent 2: [1]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.
