Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  45  89  68  68
1  40  27  42  88  28
2  82  81  18  36   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total perceived value from the items they receive. This involves finding an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuation of the items.

Given the valuations:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 81 | 45 | 89 | 68 | 68 |
| 1          | 40 | 27 | 42 | 88 | 28 |
| 2          | 82 | 81 | 18 | 36 |  5 |

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that tries to balance the perceived value for each agent. We will aim for a distribution that tries to minimize envy by considering high-value items for each agent.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (89), Item 0 (81), Item 3 (68), Item 4 (68).
   - Allocate Item 2 (89) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (88), Item 2 (42), Item 0 (40).
   - Allocate Item 3 (88) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (82), Item 1 (81), Item 3 (36).
   - Allocate Item 0 (82) and Item 1 (81) to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated 4 items, and 1 item is left to allocate. We need to ensure all items are distributed, so let's evaluate the remaining items:

- Remaining items are Item 4.
- Agent 0 values Item 4 at 68.
- Agent 1 values Item 4 at 28.
- Agent 2 values Item 4 at 5.

Since Agent 0 has a higher valuation for Item 4 among the remaining options, we allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that maximize their perceived value based on their individual preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
