Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  55  28  21   1
1  77   9  82  75   4
2  41  21  84  32  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77  9 82 75  4]
 [41 21 84 32 30]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their individual valuations while striving for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should envy another agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

### Step 1: Analyze Valuations
The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [23, 55, 28, 21, 1]
Agent 1: [77, 9, 82, 75, 4]
Agent 2: [41, 21, 84, 32, 30]
```

### Step 2: Determine Best Allocations
To determine who should get which items, let's start by considering each item's highest valuation:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (77)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (55)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (84)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (75)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (30)

### Step 3: Initial Allocation
Based on the highest valuations, we can assign:

- Item 0 to Agent 1
- Item 1 to Agent 0
- Item 2 to Agent 2
- Item 3 to Agent 1
- Item 4 to Agent 2

### Step 4: Ensure Fairness and Integer Allocations
Let's check if this allocation is fair:

- Agent 0: [1] with a value of 55
- Agent 1: [0, 3] with a total value of 152 (77+75)
- Agent 2: [2, 4] with a total value of 114 (84+30)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation, and no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuation.

### Final Allocations
Based on the above analysis, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, achieving a fair division in terms of envy-freeness among the agents.
