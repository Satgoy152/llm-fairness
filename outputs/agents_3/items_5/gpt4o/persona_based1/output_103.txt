Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  72  13  19  70
1  87  40  37  12  41
2  92  40  84  75   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: `[49, 72, 13, 19, 70]`
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: `[87, 40, 37, 12, 41]`
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: `[92, 40, 84, 75, 2]`

We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent by assigning the items they value the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item whenever possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Allocate item 4 (value 70 for Agent 0, 41 for Agent 1, 2 for Agent 2):**
   - Best for Agent 0 (value 70).

2. **Allocate item 3 (value 19 for Agent 0, 12 for Agent 1, 75 for Agent 2):**
   - Best for Agent 2 (value 75).

3. **Allocate item 0 (value 49 for Agent 0, 87 for Agent 1, 92 for Agent 2):**
   - Best for Agent 2 (value 92).

4. **Allocate item 2 (value 13 for Agent 0, 37 for Agent 1, 84 for Agent 2):**
   - Best for Agent 2 (value 84).

5. **Allocate item 1 (value 72 for Agent 0, 40 for Agent 1, 40 for Agent 2):**
   - Best for Agent 0 (value 72).

### Final Allocations

Agent 0: Items 1, 4  
Agent 1: No items  
Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 3

Now, present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
