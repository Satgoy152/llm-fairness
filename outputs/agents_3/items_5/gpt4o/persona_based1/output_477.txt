Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  23  26   5  90
1  89  47  37  49  28
2  97   7  55  48  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations provided by each agent, we aim for an envy-free division. This means each agent should feel they received the best possible allocation given their valuations. Since there are 3 agents and 5 items, we must ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.

### Approach:
1. **Initial Observations**:
    - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 90.
    - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 89.
    - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 97.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
    - Start by assigning the highest-valued item to each agent when possible, ensuring that the allocations do not overlap.
    - Adjust allocations to minimize envy and ensure all items are assigned.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
    - **Agent 0**: Receives item 4 (highest valued by themselves).
    - **Agent 1**: Receives items 1 and 3. Item 1 is their second highest value, and item 3 is also highly valued by them.
    - **Agent 2**: Receives items 0 and 2. Item 0 is their highest valued item, and item 2 is also valued reasonably by them.

This allocation minimizes potential envy because each agent receives items they highly value, and no agent can claim another agent's allocation is better based on their own valuations.

### Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
