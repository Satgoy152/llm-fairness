Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  69  19  52  68
1  71  50  55  10  87
2  72  11  57  72  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and ideally, the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Given the valuations matrix, let's try to find an allocation that considers these factors.

### Valuations Matrix:

```
Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4
----------------------------------
0          | 8  | 69 | 19 | 52 | 68
1          | 71 | 50 | 55 | 10 | 87
2          | 72 | 11 | 57 | 72 | 93
```

### Steps to Allocate Items:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** 
   - Agent 0: Highest value for item 1 (69).
   - Agent 1: Highest value for item 4 (87).
   - Agent 2: Highest value for item 4 (93).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (since 93 > 87, agent 2 values it more).

3. **Remaining Items and Considerations:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 2, and 3.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 72, highest among agents).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 55, highest among agents after allocation of previous items).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 52, highest among remaining items for Agent 0).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This allocation tries to balance each agent's highest values while ensuring all items are allocated.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 5.
