Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  48  17  24  84
1  80  30  79   8  29
2  61  94  22   4  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy. A possible approach is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, which is known to be both efficient and approximately envy-free. The objective is to maximize the product of the agents' utilities.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0:  [95, 48, 17, 24, 84]
Agent 1:  [80, 30, 79, 8, 29]
Agent 2:  [61, 94, 22, 4, 91]
```

Our goal is to assign each item to exactly one agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's explore a potential allocation:

1. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest (95).
2. **Assign item 1 to Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest (94).
3. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest (79).
4. **Assign item 3 to Agent 0**:
   - Although Agent 0 values it (24), it's a low-value item for all, but Agent 0 maximizes the product with this choice.
5. **Assign item 4 to Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it highly (91), which balances the allocation with item 1.

This allocation is efficient as it maximizes the product of valuations and is relatively envy-free given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
