Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  59  18  34  90
1  26  54   4  51  91
2  67  29  39  72  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for a division that is as envy-free as possible. This means each agent should ideally receive items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll consider the agents' valuations and try to ensure that each agent feels that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 55 + 59 + 18 + 34 + 90 = 256
   - Agent 1: 26 + 54 + 4 + 51 + 91 = 226
   - Agent 2: 67 + 29 + 39 + 72 + 10 = 217

2. **Identify the Most Valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (90), Item 1 (59)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (91), Item 3 (51)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (72), Item 0 (67)

3. **Make Initial Allocations Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (most valued by Agent 1)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (most valued by Agent 2)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (second-most valued by Agent 2)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-most valued by Agent 0)

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Valuation:**
   - Item 2 is remaining. We can allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

5. **Review Allocations to Ensure Fairness:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0 and 3

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent has no envy over the allocation, given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
