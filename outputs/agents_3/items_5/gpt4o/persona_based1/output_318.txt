Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  79  88   9  50
1   8  35  98  12   1
2  67  37  39  58  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [67 37 39 58 54]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly while considering envy-freeness, we can use methods like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) or the Adjusted Winner Procedure. However, given the small scale of this problem, we can approach this manually by trying to balance the allocations based on the valuations in the table.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Values: [87, 79, 88, 9, 50]

- Agent 1:
  - Values: [8, 35, 98, 12, 1]

- Agent 2:
  - Values: [67, 37, 39, 58, 54]

The goal is to minimize envy and maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. 

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items that are most valuable to them but not so much to others.
- Agent 1 receives their most valuable item.
- Agent 2 gets items that maximize their valuation without making others envious.

Let's consider this allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it is most valuable to them and significantly less valuable to others.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it is highly valuable to them and less valuable to others.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it is most valuable to them and not very valuable to others.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because it is the second most valuable to them after item 0.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 because it maximizes their remaining valuation.

Now, let's check if this allocation is fair and envy-free. 

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 166 (87 + 79).
- Agent 1 gets item 2, with a total valuation of 98.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4, with a total valuation of 112 (58 + 54).

This allocation seems fair because no agent would want to trade their allocation with another at the cost of their own valuation, given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
