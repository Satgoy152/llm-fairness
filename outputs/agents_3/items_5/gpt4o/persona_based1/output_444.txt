Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  73  78  28  96
1  91  68  38  32  49
2  38  24  89  12  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [38 24 89 12 90]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free and efficient distribution. Given the valuations table, we can follow a strategy to minimize envy by attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  73  78  28  96
1  91  68  38  32  49
2  38  24  89  12  90
```

Let's distribute the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 4**: The highest value for item 4 is by agent 0 (value 96). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: The highest value for item 0 is by agent 1 (value 91). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value for item 2 is by agent 2 (value 89). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 1**: The highest value for item 1 is by agent 0 (value 73). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
5. **Item 3**: The highest value for item 3 is by agent 0 (value 28). Assign item 3 to agent 0.

Now each agent has:
- Agent 0: items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: items [0]
- Agent 2: items [2]

This allocation maximizes the total utility across agents and ensures that each agent receives some items to minimize envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
