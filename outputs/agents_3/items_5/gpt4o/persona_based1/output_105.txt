Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  64   3  97  13
1  41  52  77  20  13
2  54  11  69   6  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 5 items to the 3 agents in a way that considers fairness and attempts to minimize envy, we can use various fair division techniques. In this case, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, which means that each agent should prefer their own allocation of items over the allocation of any other agent.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent for each item:

```
Agent 0: [61, 64,  3, 97, 13]
Agent 1: [41, 52, 77, 20, 13]
Agent 2: [54, 11, 69,  6, 64]
```

A straightforward approach to achieve an envy-free allocation can be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it ensures each agent ends up with at least one item. This strategy doesn't always guarantee a perfectly envy-free allocation, but it is a good starting point given the constraints. 

Let's allocate each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (61).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (64).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (77).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (64).

Assuming each agent must receive at least one item, we need to adjust:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent values their own items more than or equal to those assigned to others.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
