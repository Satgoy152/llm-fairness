Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  13  96  73  62
1  79  25  99  37   7
2  51  71  38  28  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll look for a distribution where each agent values their allocation as highly as possible relative to the others. We want to minimize the likelihood of any agent envying another's allocation. 

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items based on maximizing individual agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 3 (96 and 73).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 0 (99 and 79).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 0 (71 and 51).

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Item 2**: Highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. However, Agent 1 values it the most (99), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Highly valued by Agent 0, so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Highly valued by Agent 1, but also preferred by Agent 2. Since Agent 1 already has item 2, allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2, who values it second highest.
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0 as it provides a balanced value after assigning other items.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 and 1

This results in a fair allocation where each agent receives items that they value and minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
