Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  41  31  91  70
1  66  70  81  71  68
2  79  39  75  11  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness or as close to it as possible, where each agent feels they have received the most valuable combination of items given the constraints.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 48 + 41 + 31 + 91 + 70 = 281
- Agent 1: 66 + 70 + 81 + 71 + 68 = 356
- Agent 2: 79 + 39 + 75 + 11 + 63 = 267

Next, we will try to allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation for their items is maximized, keeping in mind that each agent should ideally have a similar total value for their allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 91). We will allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 81). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 79). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 out of 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining two items (1 and 4).

4. **Remaining Items (1 and 4)**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 41 and item 4 at 70.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 70 and item 4 at 68.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 39 and item 4 at 63.
   
   Since Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (70), allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   
   The remaining item, item 4, is valued highest by Agent 0 (70), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 2**: Item 0.

This allocation tries to balance the total value perceived by each agent to their advantage while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
