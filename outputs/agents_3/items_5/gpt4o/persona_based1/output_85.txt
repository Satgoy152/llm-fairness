Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  24  36  16  39
1  91   5   7  12  43
2  22   7  92  28   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own. Although achieving absolute envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with integer allocations and different total valuations, we can strive to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 58, 24, 36, 16, 39
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 91, 5, 7, 12, 43
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: 22, 7, 92, 28, 3

We'll use a simple heuristic to start: allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate based on this greedy approach:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 91 by Agent 1
2. Item 1: Highest value is 24 by Agent 0
3. Item 2: Highest value is 92 by Agent 2
4. Item 3: Highest value is 28 by Agent 2
5. Item 4: Highest value is 43 by Agent 1

Now, let's review the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2, Item 3

This allocation results in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, minimizing potential envy across the agents.
