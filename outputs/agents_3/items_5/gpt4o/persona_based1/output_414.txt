Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  44  92  68  98
1   5  39  57  49  39
2  58  98  78   5  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [58 98 78  5 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels that they have received a fair share of the items based on their personal valuations. One approach to achieve fairness is to minimize envy among the agents, which can be done by assigning items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives relative to their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations given in the table:

```
Agent 0: [36, 44, 92, 68, 98]
Agent 1: [5, 39, 57, 49, 39]
Agent 2: [58, 98, 78, 5, 73]
```

A straightforward allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, which helps in reducing envy. Below is an allocation based on this heuristic:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 58.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 92.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest at 68.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

This allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
