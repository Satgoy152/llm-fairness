Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  25  28  36  49
1  75  41  32  78  62
2  86  88  21   5  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows:  
  0: 22, 1: 25, 2: 28, 3: 36, 4: 49  
- **Agent 1** values items as follows:  
  0: 75, 1: 41, 2: 32, 3: 78, 4: 62  
- **Agent 2** values items as follows:  
  0: 86, 1: 88, 2: 21, 3: 5, 4: 96  

A potential envy-free allocation strategy could be to allocate items based on the highest valuation of each item and checking if an agent can be satisfied with the bundle they receive:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (86)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (88)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (28)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (78)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (96)

Based on these valuations, let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0** gets item 2 because it's their highest valuation among available items.
- **Agent 1** gets item 3 because it's their highest valuation among available items.
- **Agent 2** gets items 0, 1, and 4 because they have the highest valuations for these items, and this allocation provides them with significant value.

This allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This distribution maximizes each agent's satisfaction given their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.
