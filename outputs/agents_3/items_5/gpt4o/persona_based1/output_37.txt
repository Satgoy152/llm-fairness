Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  51  66  66  10
1  23  52  93  53  65
2  68  94  62  74  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that minimizes envy. This means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, if possible.

One way to approach this is to use a method like the "Envy-Free Item Allocation" which tries to balance the valuations across agents. Given the valuations in the table, letâ€™s try to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 seems to have lower valuations on most items compared to Agents 1 and 2.
   - Agent 2 values items 1 and 4 highly.
   - Agent 1 has a particularly high valuation on item 2.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Agent 2**: Given the high valuation on items 1 and 4, allocate these to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because of the highest valuation on that item.
   - **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0, which Agent 0 values reasonably compared to the other agents' valuations on these items.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Items 1 and 4

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value among agents, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
