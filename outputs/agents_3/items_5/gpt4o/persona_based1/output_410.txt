Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  10  59  71  45
1  12  76  86  43  99
2  77  61  94  60  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach to solve this problem is to use the "Envy-Free Matching" method or similar heuristic strategies. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Prioritize Items**: Identify which items are highly valued by each agent.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Begin allocating items to agents based on their highest preferences while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

4. **Check for Envy**: After allocating items, ensure no agent envies another agent's allocation by comparing total valuations of the received items.

5. **Adjust if Needed**: If any envy exists, adjust the allocation to remove it.

Let's calculate the total valuations and proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: 34 + 10 + 59 + 71 + 45 = 219
- Agent 1: 12 + 76 + 86 + 43 + 99 = 316
- Agent 2: 77 + 61 + 94 + 60 + 48 = 340

Based on these valuations, we can prioritize allocations to minimize envy:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign the highest valued item for each agent:
     - Agent 0 values item 3 (71) highly.
     - Agent 1 values item 4 (99) highly.
     - Agent 2 values item 2 (94) highly.

2. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0, 1 are left.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign remaining items by considering the next highest preferences:
     - Agent 0 gets item 0 (34), which is their next highest preference.
     - Agent 2 gets item 1 (61), which is their next highest preference.

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, minimizing envy and maintaining fairness.
