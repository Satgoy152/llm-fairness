Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  40  65  51  27
1  77  39  96  82  43
2  67  84  19  59  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we can apply principles from fair division theory. One common approach is to try to maximize the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities of all agents. Alternatively, we can aim for an envy-free allocation if possible.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [26, 40, 65, 51, 27]
- Agent 1: [77, 39, 96, 82, 43]
- Agent 2: [67, 84, 19, 59, 52]

Let's consider an allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 65).

2. Agent 1:
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 96), but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 3 (value 82).

3. Agent 2:
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (value 84).

At this point, we have allocated items 1, 2, and 3. Items 0 and 4 remain.

To complete the allocation:

- Items 0 and 4 can be allocated in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction:

  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it has a higher relative value to Agent 1 (77) compared to Agent 0 (26) and Agent 2 (67).
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as it has a higher relative value to Agent 2 (52) compared to Agent 0 (27) and Agent 1 (43).

Thus, the allocation that maximizes fairness and attempts to minimize envy is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and attempts to balance the valuations across agents.
