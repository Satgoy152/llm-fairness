Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  59  87  98  63
1  34  12  48  40  55
2  68  70   2  95  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and considers each agent's valuations. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which allows for some level of envy but ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from another agent's bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: Values items highly, especially item 3.
- Agent 1: Values item 4 the most.
- Agent 2: Values item 3 highly, and item 1 is also valued significantly.

A potential fair allocation is as follows:

1. Assign the item each agent values the most:
   - Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 98).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 55).
   - Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 70).

2. Allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations while avoiding envy:
   - Agent 0 also gets item 0 (value 89).
   - Agent 2 also gets item 2 (value 2).

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations, maintains the EF1 fairness criterion, and ensures that envy can be minimized.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
