Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18   5  22  25  92
1  44  99  26   0  19
2  50  33  49   9  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate all 5 items such that the distribution is as fair as possible, minimizing envy among the agents. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (92).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (99).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (50).

2. **Initial allocation based on highest valuations**:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Remaining items are 2 and 3.
   - Evaluate remaining items based on the highest value for the agents who haven't received an item from the remaining items yet.

4. **Evaluate the allocation of items 2 and 3**:
   - For item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 26, and Agent 2 at 49.
   - For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 0, and Agent 2 at 9.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 does not value it at all and Agent 0 has the next highest valuation after Agent 2.

5. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives item 1.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their most valued items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
