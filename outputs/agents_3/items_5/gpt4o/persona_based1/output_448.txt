Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  35  94  59   8
1  97  93  60  77  29
2  90  48  55  88  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method known as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar fair division algorithms. However, given the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can try to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent, while keeping the allocation envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

Here is one possible allocation that considers the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 94. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 97. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 88. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Now, Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 1 at 93, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
5. Finally, item 4 remains, which has relatively low valuations for all agents, but Agent 2 has a higher valuation than the others at 13. So, we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent.
