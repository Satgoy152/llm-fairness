Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  34  87  96   6
1  71  11  46  33  49
2  73  83  51   8  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation across all agents. Here's a step-by-step approach to find a near envy-free allocation:

1. **List the Items and Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values: [2, 34, 87, 96, 6]
   - Agent 1 values: [71, 11, 46, 33, 49]
   - Agent 2 values: [73, 83, 51, 8, 25]

2. **Consider Each Item's Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it most at 73.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it most at 83.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it most at 87.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it most at 96.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it most at 49.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Initially allocate each item to the agent that values it the most.

4. **Check and Adjust for Fair Distribution:**
   - Ensure that all agents receive items, and that the allocation is as fair as possible.

5. **Reallocate to Balance:**
   - Adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
