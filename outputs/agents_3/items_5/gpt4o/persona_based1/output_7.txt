Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  62  98  10  35
1  24   7  11  51  52
2  41  97  71  17  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that maximizes fairness, such as an envy-free allocation if possible. Given the valuations provided, we need to assign each item to an agent such that the sum of values for each agent is relatively balanced and no agent envies another more than necessary. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [10, 62, 98, 10, 35]
- Agent 1 values: [24, 7, 11, 51, 52]
- Agent 2 values: [41, 97, 71, 17, 13]

We will try to allocate items to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. **Allocate item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate item 1:**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 51.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate item 4:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 52.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

5. **Allocate item 0:**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 41.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent gets from the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and no agent is left without items, thus maintaining a fair division based on the given valuations.
