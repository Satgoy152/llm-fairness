Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  3  88  66  35   2
1  6  67   9  88  73
2  2  71  55  19  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, one approach is to maximize the sum of the assigned values for each agent, ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Let's examine the table of valuations:

```
   0   1   2   3   4
0  3  88  66  35   2
1  6  67   9  88  73
2  2  71  55  19  79
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the following steps:

1. Allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each item is given to only one agent.

2. Consider the overall distribution to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible.

3. Check that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair portion based on their preferences.

After analyzing the valuations, a possible fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (88)
- Agent 1: Items 3 (88) and 4 (73)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (2) and 2 (55)

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each item and tries to distribute them fairly among the agents.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with an attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their initial valuations.
