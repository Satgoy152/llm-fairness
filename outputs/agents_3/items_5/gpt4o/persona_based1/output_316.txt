Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  86  84  77  51
1  23  92   0  12  46
2  72   6  31  41  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation while aiming for envy-freeness, Iâ€™ll use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility among the agents. We will consider each agent's preference and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's begin by examining the highest valued items for each agent:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 98
- Item 1: 86
- Item 2: 84
- Item 3: 77
- Item 4: 51

Agent 1 values:
- Item 1: 92
- Item 4: 46
- Item 0: 23
- Item 3: 12
- Item 2: 0

Agent 2 values:
- Item 4: 75
- Item 0: 72
- Item 3: 41
- Item 2: 31
- Item 1: 6

To maximize fairness, we will try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it gives them the highest value (98).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it gives them the highest value (92).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it gives them the highest value (75).

Now we have allocated three items, and each agent has received one item. The remaining items to be allocated are items 2 and 3.

Let's consider the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2 (84), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 41, which is higher than Agent 1's value for it (12), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
