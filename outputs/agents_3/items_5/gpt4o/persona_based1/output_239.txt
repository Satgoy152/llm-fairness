Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77   1  18  87  61
1  18  26  75  63  66
2  25  34  29  73  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 26 75 63 66]
 [25 34 29 73 50]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent prefers their own bundle of items over others'.

First, let's look at the valuation table for clarity:

```
     0   1   2   3   4
0  77   1  18  87  61
1  18  26  75  63  66
2  25  34  29  73  50
```

We'll start by identifying which items are most valued by each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest.

To minimize envy, we can try to assign each agent their most valued item if possible, and then fairly distribute the remaining items.

Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 3**: It is highly valued by Agent 0 (87) and Agent 2 (73). Let's give it to Agent 0 since they have the highest valuation for it.

2. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (75), so let's assign it to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (77), but Agent 0 already has item 3. The next highest valuation is by Agent 2 (25). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (66), so let's assign it to Agent 1.

5. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (34), so let's assign it to Agent 2.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
