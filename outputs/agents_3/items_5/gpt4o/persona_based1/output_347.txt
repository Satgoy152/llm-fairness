Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  12  56  70  37
1  84  21  30  73  39
2  40  30  57  65  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or at least minimizes envy as much as possible. We'll aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's denote the agents as A0, A1, and A2, and the items as I0, I1, I2, I3, and I4. The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: I0=11, I1=12, I2=56, I3=70, I4=37
- Agent 1: I0=84, I1=21, I2=30, I3=73, I4=39
- Agent 2: I0=40, I1=30, I2=57, I3=65, I4=11

To minimize envy, we can attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets the items they value the most and the total value each agent receives is balanced.

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest (84).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most (30).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (56).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (70).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 2 and Agent 0 (39).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3 (valuations: 56, 70)
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4 (valuations: 84, 39)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (valuation: 30)

Each agent receives a combination of items that maximizes their total value given the constraints.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives the highest possible value from the items they are allocated.
