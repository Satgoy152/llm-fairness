Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  28  90  37  56
1  30  18  99  95   2
2  68  85  99   0  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation given their valuations. We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed, and no agent is overly envious of another's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [48, 28, 90, 37, 56]
- Agent 1: [30, 18, 99, 95, 2]
- Agent 2: [68, 85, 99, 0, 85]

Let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent first:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (99), but it's also high for item 3 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2 (99), but also high for item 1 (85) and item 4 (85).

If we allocate based on the highest values without causing too much envy, we consider:

- **Step 1**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 0. This satisfies Agent 0's highest preference.
- **Step 2**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 1. This is Agent 1's second-highest preference.
- **Step 3**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 2. This is one of Agent 2's highest preferences.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 4:

- **Step 4**: Allocate item 0 to Agent 2. This provides Agent 2 with two items they value highly (68 for item 0).
- **Step 5**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 1. While not ideal, it gives Agent 1 two items, including one they highly value (95 for item 3).

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution tries to respect the highest value preferences without leaving any items unallocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
