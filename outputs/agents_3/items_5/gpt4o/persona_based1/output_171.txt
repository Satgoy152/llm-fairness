Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  20  18  26   8
1  25  29  30  94  10
2  97  90  21  87  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 29 30 94 10]
 [97 90 21 87 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or reducing envy among the agents. The goal is to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with the items they receive, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [17, 20, 18, 26, 8]
- Agent 1 values: [25, 29, 30, 94, 10]
- Agent 2 values: [97, 90, 21, 87, 48]

Let's start by assigning items that have a clear preference by one agent over others.

1. **Item 3** has a very high value for Agent 1 (94), significantly higher than it is for Agent 0 (26) and Agent 2 (87). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 2 (97), much higher than for Agent 0 (17) and Agent 1 (25). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1** has a high value for Agent 2 as well (90), much higher than Agent 0 (20) and Agent 1 (29). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 2** has its highest valuation by Agent 1 (30), compared to Agent 0 (18) and Agent 2 (21). Thus, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4** has a relatively balanced lower valuation across all agents, but Agent 2 values it the highest at 48, compared to Agent 0 (8) and Agent 1 (10). Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value the most, reducing potential envy among them.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
