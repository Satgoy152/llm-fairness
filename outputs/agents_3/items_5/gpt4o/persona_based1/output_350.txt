Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  23  36  19  79
1  85  78  71  58  71
2  89   3  77  28   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly, we aim to minimize envy among the agents while ensuring each agent receives items. One common approach is to utilize the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives (max-min fairness). We want to distribute the items such that each agent receives a portion of the total value that they deem fair, or at least the best possible given the constraints.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
- Agent 0's total value: \(7 + 23 + 36 + 19 + 79 = 164\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(85 + 78 + 71 + 58 + 71 = 363\)
- Agent 2's total value: \(89 + 3 + 77 + 28 + 7 = 204\)

Now, we'll attempt to allocate the items in a way that provides a fair distribution based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (85), so we start by allocating item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (77), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most (79), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
4. We then need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3. 
   - Agent 1 values item 1 second highest (78) among the remaining items, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, item 3 can be allocated to Agent 2. Although it's not their highest preference, it balances the allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items close to their highest valuations and minimizes potential envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 has item 4 with a valuation of 79.
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 1 with a total valuation of \(85 + 78 = 163\).
- Agent 2 has items 2 and 3 with a total valuation of \(77 + 28 = 105\).

This distribution aims to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, attempting to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
