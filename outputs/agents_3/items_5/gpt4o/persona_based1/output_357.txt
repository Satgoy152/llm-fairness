Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  28  47  91   1
1  23  70  77  14  91
2  55  92  11  45  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 70 77 14 91]
 [55 92 11 45 88]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 5 items among the 3 agents, we aim to consider envy-freeness, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their share.

Here are the agent-item valuations for clarity:

- **Agent 0**: [25, 28, 47, 91, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [23, 70, 77, 14, 91]
- **Agent 2**: [55, 92, 11, 45, 88]

We will try to maximize the total value each agent gets, considering their preferences:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (91).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (91).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (92).

Let's start by allocating these highest-valued items to each agent:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 2. We'll allocate them to maximize the satisfaction of the agents:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are 25 (Agent 0), 23 (Agent 1), 55 (Agent 2). Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Valuations are 47 (Agent 0), 77 (Agent 1), 11 (Agent 2). Allocate to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 0]

Each agent gets a reasonable allocation based on their preferences, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
