Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  96  72  33  69
1  38  82  74  87  77
2  82  27  21  95  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim for an envy-free or at least an equitable division where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, ensuring no agent feels that another has a better allocation.

Considering the provided valuations, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (96) and item 4 (69).
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (87) and also values item 4 reasonably (77).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for item 0 (82) and item 3 (95).

Using these preferences, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 as well, as it is their second most valuable item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, since it is valued highly by both Agent 0 and Agent 1, but Agent 1 values it slightly higher.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is not highly valued by any, but Agent 0 has space for another item and values it more than Agent 1 and Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value reasonably without causing significant envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
