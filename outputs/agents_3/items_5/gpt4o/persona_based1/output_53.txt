Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  50  18  92  79
1  75  89  36  87  76
2   7  43  93  13  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free, each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A reasonable approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or a similar strategy to ensure each agent's perceived value is maximized.

Based on the valuations given:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 46
- Item 1: 50
- Item 2: 18
- Item 3: 92
- Item 4: 79

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 89
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 76

Agent 2's valuations:  
- Item 0: 7
- Item 1: 43
- Item 2: 93
- Item 3: 13
- Item 4: 93

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign the most preferred items to each agent** based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation more than their own.

2. **Balance the remaining items** to ensure envy-freeness. 

Using these principles:

- Agent 2 highly values Items 2 and 4 (both valued at 93). Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 highly values Item 1 (valued at 89). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 highly values Item 3 (valued at 92). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, consider the remaining items:

- Items left: 0 and 4
- Agent 0's remaining highest value item is Item 4 (valued at 79).
- Agent 1's remaining highest value item is Item 0 (valued at 75).

Assign these accordingly:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

With these assignments, we ensure that each agent receives a fair share of their perceived value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as fairly as possible given the constraints.
