Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  40  41  40  18
1  65  81  49  65  55
2  40  26  16  23  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76 40 41 40 18]
 [65 81 49 65 55]
 [40 26 16 23 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [76, 40, 41, 40, 18]
- Agent 1: [65, 81, 49, 65, 55]
- Agent 2: [40, 26, 16, 23, 19]

We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items sums to 5. Let's consider how to allocate them:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (76)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (41)
   - Assign Items 0 and 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (81)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (65)
   - Assign Items 1 and 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (40), but already assigned
   - Next highest: Item 4 (19)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

By this allocation, none of the agents end up with items they value the least, and we attempt to maximize each agent's total utility.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of distributing all 5 items among the agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
