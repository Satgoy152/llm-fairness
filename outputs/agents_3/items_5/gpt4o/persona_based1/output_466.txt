Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  17  58   0  44
1  81  52  55  22   3
2  93  25  33  51  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, a common approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as envy-free as possible given the constraints. In this scenario, we have three agents and five items to distribute. Let's proceed by analyzing the valuation matrix and making a fair allocation:

Valuation Matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  17  58   0  44
1  81  52  55  22   3
2  93  25  33  51  91
```

To allocate the items, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Look for the highest valuation for each item and note the corresponding agent.
2. **Assign Items to Agents**: Assign items to the agents based on the highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 52 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 58 by Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 51 by Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 91 by Agent 2.

Now let's adjust for fairness and ensure all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 2** is getting items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 0** gets item 2.
3. **Agent 1** gets item 1.

This allocation leverages the highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences for at least one item, while all items are allocated. Agent 2 receives three items because they have the highest valuations for those items, while Agents 0 and 1 each receive one item with respective highest valuations that were not overtaken by Agent 2.
