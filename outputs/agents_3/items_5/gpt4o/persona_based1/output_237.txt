Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  53  61  23   2
1  60   5  60  83  94
2  30  18  27  11  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use methods like the "Envy-Free Matchings" or "Maximin Share" to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that they value as at least as good as any other agent's allocation. Given that there are only three agents and five items, we need to assign the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction for their allocation without causing envy.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Given the values, Agent 0 highly values item 2 (61) and item 1 (53). We'll assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 (83) and 4 (94). We'll assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This leaves item 0, which Agent 2 values at 30. We'll assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2] with values [53, 61] for a total value of 114.
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 4] with values [83, 94] for a total value of 177.
- Agent 2 receives item [0] with a value of 30.

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. Though Agent 2 receives a lower total value, this allocation ensures that each agent receives some items and minimizes potential envy given the constraints.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
