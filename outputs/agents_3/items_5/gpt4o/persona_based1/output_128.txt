Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  14  92  32  90
1  29  60  12  86  19
2  47  70  48  73  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [47 70 48 73 36]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations, we can use an approach that seeks to minimize envy by considering the highest valuation each agent has for the unallocated items and allocating based on maximizing the perceived value for each agent.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [16, 14, 92, 32, 90]
- Agent 1: [29, 60, 12, 86, 19]
- Agent 2: [47, 70, 48, 73, 36]

We will proceed by assigning the highest valued items to each agent one by one, considering each agent's preferences while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 92.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 86.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 70.

Now, we have assigned items 2, 3, and 1 to agents 0, 1, and 2 respectively. Next, the remaining items are 0 and 4.

4. For item 0, Agent 2 values it highest at 47.
5. For item 4, Agent 0 values it highest at 90.

Given these assignments, we can now present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items aligned with their highest valuations.
