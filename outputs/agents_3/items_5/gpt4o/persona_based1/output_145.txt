Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  12  37  29  54
1   5  34  24  17  18
2  84  21  55  78  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner while considering envy-freeness, a common approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which tries to maximize the product of utilities. We'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets some satisfaction while trying to minimize envy.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get if they received certain items:

- Agent 0 values: [12, 12, 37, 29, 54]
- Agent 1 values: [5, 34, 24, 17, 18]
- Agent 2 values: [84, 21, 55, 78, 22]

Now let's allocate items:

1. Agent 2 highly values item 0. Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 gives them a high utility.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 4. Allocating item 4 to Agent 0 gives them a high utility.
3. Agent 1 highly values item 1. Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 gives them a high utility.
4. For item 2, Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it highly, but Agent 2 already has item 0. Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 would give them another high utility.
5. Finally, item 3 can be allocated to Agent 2, as they value it highly.

The allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 3

This allocation maximizes each agent's utility based on their highest valued items, considering an integer allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
