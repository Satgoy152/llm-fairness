Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  81  25  39  60
1  13  39  97   5  54
2  75  66  93  30   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent gets one or more items, and no agent feels another agent has received a better set of items based on their own valuations. Given the table of valuations, we will attempt to make the allocation as fair as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocation:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 88 
- Item 1: 81 
- Item 2: 25 
- Item 3: 39 
- Item 4: 60

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 13 
- Item 1: 39 
- Item 2: 97 
- Item 3: 5 
- Item 4: 54

Agent 2 values:
- Item 0: 75 
- Item 1: 66 
- Item 2: 93 
- Item 3: 30 
- Item 4: 0

To minimize envy:
- Agent 0 has high value for item 0 and item 1.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 2.
- Agent 2 has high value for item 2, but we will try to balance the other items to satisfy all agents.

Considering these valuations, a possible allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0 (total value: 169 for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (total value: 97 for Agent 1).
- Assign Item 3 and Item 4 to Agent 2 (total value: 30 for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 5. This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives, given their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
