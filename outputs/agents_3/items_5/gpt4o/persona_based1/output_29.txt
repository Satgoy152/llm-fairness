Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7   3  60  95  90
1   9   9  52   3  78
2  27  22  29   9  21
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9  9 52  3 78]
 [27 22 29  9 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [7, 3, 60, 95, 90]
- Agent 1: [9, 9, 52, 3, 78]
- Agent 2: [27, 22, 29, 9, 21]

We want to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 3 (95) and 4 (90).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (78).
   - Agent 2 does not have extremely high valuations as compared to agents 0 and 1, but values item 0 (27) the most.

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Perceived Value:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the most.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, since it's their highest valued item and they value it more than Agent 2.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it's their highest valued item.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1 and 2 are left. 
   - Agent 0 can take item 2, as it provides significant value to them (60).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it more than Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.
