Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  70  62  94  28
1  79  22  67   7  81
2  60  52  94  30  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible, or at least an allocation that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [96, 70, 62, 94, 28]
Agent 1: [79, 22, 67, 7, 81]
Agent 2: [60, 52, 94, 30, 15]
```

To minimize envy, we can use the strategy of assigning items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (96), then Agent 1 (79), then Agent 2 (60).
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (70), then Agent 2 (52), then Agent 1 (22).
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (94), then Agent 1 (67), then Agent 0 (62).
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (94), then Agent 2 (30), then Agent 1 (7).
   - Assign to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (81), then Agent 0 (28), then Agent 2 (15).
   - Assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we observe:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1 receives item: 4
- Agent 2 receives item: 2

This allocation aims to minimize envy given the valuations. Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
