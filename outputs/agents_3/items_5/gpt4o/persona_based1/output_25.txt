Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  12  39  27  73
1  45  67  67  95  37
2   8   0  87  36   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, let's consider using the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. A common approach is the "Envy-Free" allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. To achieve this, we can look for an allocation that balances the valuations, ensuring no agent envies another.

Let's evaluate the best possible allocation by considering the total valuations and distribution:

1. **Agent 0 Valuation:** 99, 12, 39, 27, 73
2. **Agent 1 Valuation:** 45, 67, 67, 95, 37
3. **Agent 2 Valuation:** 8, 0, 87, 36, 4

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Valued highest by Agent 0 (99). Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 3:** 
   - Valued highest by Agent 1 (95). Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Valued highest by Agent 2 (87). Assign to Agent 2.

4. **Item 4:** 
   - Considered by Agent 0 (73) and Agent 1 (37). Assign to Agent 0 to balance utility.

5. **Item 1:**
   - Valued by Agent 1 (67). Assign to Agent 1 for a balanced outcome.

### Final Allocation:

By following the above steps, we ensure that each agent receives at least some items they highly value, aiming for envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items in a way that tries to minimize envy and maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
