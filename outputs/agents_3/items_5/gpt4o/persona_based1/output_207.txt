Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  23  26   5  83
1  94  93  37  98  90
2  10  58  46  35  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of items given to another agent over their own allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Begin by identifying which agents value each item the most. This will help us understand potential preferences and guide us in making equitable allocations.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation**: Assign the items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for fairness**: After the initial allocation, compare the total value each agent receives. If there is a significant disparity, consider swapping items to improve fairness.

Here's the breakdown of each item's highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (98), Agent 1 (94), Agent 2 (10)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (93), Agent 2 (58), Agent 0 (23)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (37), Agent 2 (46), Agent 0 (26)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (98), Agent 2 (35), Agent 0 (5)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (83), Agent 1 (90), Agent 2 (50)

An initial allocation can be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest value)

After this allocation:
- Agent 0 has items 0, 4 with total value 181.
- Agent 1 has items 1, 3 with total value 191.
- Agent 2 has item 2 with total value 46.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item. Agent 2 receives less value, but without a significant envy-free alternative, this allocation balances the distribution of items and values reasonably.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
