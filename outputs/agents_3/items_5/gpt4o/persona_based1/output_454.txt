Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  12  45   9  56
1  14  46   4  17  45
2  90   6  31  68  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness means that each agent prefers their own allocation over that of any other agent, based on their valuations.

First, let's examine the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  12  45   9  56
1  14  46   4  17  45
2  90   6  31  68  91
```

We will allocate the items using the following heuristic approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item for fairness.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (90).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is from Agent 1 (46).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (45).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (68).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 (91).

Initially, this allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4

Now, we notice that Agent 2 has three items, while Agent 0 and Agent 1 have one item each. To distribute items more evenly while maintaining envy-freeness, we can reallocate as follows:

- **Item 3**: Can be given to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1 and it's the next best option.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This allocation maintains envy-freeness because each agent receives the items they value most among the unallocated items and ensures a more balanced distribution.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
