Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26   8  26  41  92
1   5  42  70  47  82
2  40  37  23  36  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Envy-freeness in this context means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's from their own perspective.

Let's consider the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 26     | 8      | 26     | 41     | 92     |
| 1     | 5      | 42     | 70     | 47     | 82     |
| 2     | 40     | 37     | 23     | 36     | 76     |

To achieve an allocation, we can implement the following approach:
1. Each agent should get the item(s) they value the most, if possible.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.
3. Try to balance overall satisfaction by checking no agent envies another's allocation significantly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:
- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (92), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (70), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (40), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:
- Item 3 is valued second highest by agent 1 (47), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Item 1 is valued second highest by agent 2 (37), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, focusing on their highest preferences, while attempting to minimize envy. Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 4, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3, which they value second and third highest.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1, which are their highest and second highest valued items.

This allocation attempts to balance fairness and satisfaction based on the given valuations.
