Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  57  22  28  37
1  12  26  77  27  93
2  44  19  32  10  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to distribute the items among the agents such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations in the table, we will use the method of ensuring Pareto efficiency and envy-freeness by examining the highest valuations for each agent and distributing accordingly.

Let's first examine the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 57.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 93.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 55, but since it's lower than Agent 1's value, we look for the next highest, which is item 0 at 44.

We will prioritize allocating the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest value for it.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest value for it after item 4 is allocated.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued available item.

Now, we look at the remaining items: 2 and 3.

- For item 2, Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
- For item 3, Agent 0 values it the most at 28.

Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 and item 3 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0 receives items [1, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 2].
- Agent 2 receives item [0].

Finally, the allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
