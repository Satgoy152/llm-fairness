Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59   1   0  30   5
1  59  90  37  42  34
2  80  80  81  82  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 90 37 42 34]
 [80 80 81 82 85]]
Output:
To tackle this problem, we need to allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents such that the allocation is fair and attempts to be envy-free. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate the items:

### Valuations Table:
```
       0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0:  59   1   0  30   5
Agent 1:  59  90  37  42  34
Agent 2:  80  80  81  82  85
```

### Allocation Plan:
1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuations across all items, so let's prioritize giving them items that maximize their total value without causing significant envy from others. We can consider giving Agent 2 the items with the highest values they have: items 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 1. Assigning item 1 to Agent 1 reduces the potential for envy from Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.

3. **Agent 0** can be given item 0, which is valued equally by both Agent 0 and Agent 1, but Agent 0 has no other high-valued options.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 4

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning the most valued items to the agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent receives at least some value.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
