Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  27  51  81  13
1  90  53  20  55  11
2  57  30  16  76  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 53 20 55 11]
 [57 30 16 76 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [53, 27, 51, 81, 13]
- Agent 1: [90, 53, 20, 55, 11]
- Agent 2: [57, 30, 16, 76, 28]

A way to approach this is to assign high-value items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring that the allocation is fair in terms of total value received by each agent.

Here's one possible fair allocation based on the data:

1. **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3** (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation considers the highest value for each item and attempts to maximize fairness by distributing the total value received by each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
