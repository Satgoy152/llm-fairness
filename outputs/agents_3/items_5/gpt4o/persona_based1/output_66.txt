Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  49  53  35  20
1   6  29  99  67  25
2  76  11  85  40  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 29 99 67 25]
 [76 11 85 40 46]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of utilities across all agents. This approach tries to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, maximizing the "fairness" of the allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [57, 49, 53, 35, 20]
- Agent 1 values: [6, 29, 99, 67, 25]
- Agent 2 values: [76, 11, 85, 40, 46]

To maximize fairness, we should try to allocate items such that the product of utilities is maximized. This often means giving each agent the items they value most, but we have to be careful to distribute the items so that all items are allocated:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 99. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 57. Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but it is already allocated. The next highest value for agent 2 is item 2, followed by item 4 at 46. Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. After allocating the above, we have items 1 and 3 remaining. 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 49 and item 3 at 35.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 67 and item 1 at 29.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 40 and item 1 at 11.

5. Allocate item 3 to agent 1 since they value it higher (67) than agent 2 (40) and agent 0 (35).
6. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 since it's their second-highest valuation (49) after item 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
