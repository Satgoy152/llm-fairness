Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  27  66  96  40
1  45  56  20  90  69
2  93  18  18  13  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 56 20 90 69]
 [93 18 18 13 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuation matrix, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is the valuation matrix for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  27  66  96  40
1  45  56  20  90  69
2  93  18  18  13  65
```

Steps to allocate the items:

1. **Finding the highest values**: First, identify the highest valuation each agent has for individual items and try to allocate accordingly to maximize overall satisfaction.

2. **Initial allocation**: Assign items to agents based on their highest value for a particular item, ensuring that each item is only assigned once and each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Adjust for fairness**: Re-evaluate and adjust assignments to ensure that the division is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Using the above steps, consider the following allocation:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they value it the most (96).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they value it the most (69).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they value it the highest (93).
- For the remaining items (1 and 2), allocate them to balance the total value.

After some evaluation, we could allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [3], total value = 96
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 4], total value = 56 + 69 = 125
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 2], total value = 93 + 18 = 111

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fairly balanced total value according to their valuations, trying to approach an envy-free distribution within the constraints given.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
