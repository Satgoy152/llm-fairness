Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  47  11  10  89
1  51  32  98  77  87
2  54  40  49  37  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 32 98 77 87]
 [54 40 49 37 93]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [67, 47, 11, 10, 89]
- Agent 1's valuations: [51, 32, 98, 77, 87]
- Agent 2's valuations: [54, 40, 49, 37, 93]

A common approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner or round-robin method, but given the nature of this problem, let's use a heuristic approach to minimize envy.

1. **Agent 1 seems to value item 2 the highest (98).** So, we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (89).** Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2 values item 0 highly (54), and it's still available.** Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. We now have items 1 and 3 left. It's beneficial to allocate:
   - Item 1 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it at 47, which is higher than the valuations by the other agents)
   - Item 3 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 values it at 77, which is higher than the valuations by the other agents)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with relatively high personal valuations, aiming to minimize envy.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation is consistent with the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
