Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  27  46  96  22
1  18  13  89  53  39
2   7  84  85  44  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations of the items.

Here are the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: Item 0 -> 49, Item 1 -> 27, Item 2 -> 46, Item 3 -> 96, Item 4 -> 22
Agent 1: Item 0 -> 18, Item 1 -> 13, Item 2 -> 89, Item 3 -> 53, Item 4 -> 39
Agent 2: Item 0 -> 7, Item 1 -> 84, Item 2 -> 85, Item 3 -> 44, Item 4 -> 54
```

To achieve a fair division, consider the maximum valuation each agent has for any item. Let's allocate items based on each agent's highest preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for Item 3 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is for Item 2 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is for Item 1 (value 84).

With these allocations, the remaining items are Item 0 and Item 4. To continue ensuring that allocations are as envy-free as possible, we should look at the next highest available valuations for these remaining items. 

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is Item 0 (value 49).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is Item 4 (value 54).

With this in mind, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3 and Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.
- Agent 2 receives Item 1 and Item 4.

This allocation aims to minimize envy based on the agents' valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
