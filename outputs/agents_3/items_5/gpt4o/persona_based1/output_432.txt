Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23   6  97  84  63
1   8  80  37  84  36
2  13   3  30  86  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23  6 97 84 63]
 [ 8 80 37 84 36]
 [13  3 30 86 56]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents in a way that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

The valuations are presented in the table as follows:

- Agent 0: [23, 6, 97, 84, 63]
- Agent 1: [8, 80, 37, 84, 36]
- Agent 2: [13, 3, 30, 86, 56]

A common approach to achieve fair division is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) solution, where we aim to maximize the product of utilities for each agent. Alternatively, if such a solution is not straightforward, we aim to minimize envy between agents by ensuring each agent receives items they value.

Let's consider the allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the highest (97), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 the highest (80), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 3 the highest (86), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 4):

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 23.
  - Agent 1 values it at 8.
  - Agent 2 values it at 13.
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 63.
  - Agent 1 values it at 36.
  - Agent 2 values it at 56.
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it the highest).

Now let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given each agent's valuations, and all items are allocated.
