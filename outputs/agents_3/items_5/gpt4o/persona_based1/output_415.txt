Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  61  57  35  52
1  40  92   7   1  56
2  82  49  95  58  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible. This means trying to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (89), 1 (61), 2 (57), 3 (35), 4 (52)
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (40), 1 (92), 2 (7), 3 (1), 4 (56)
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (82), 1 (49), 2 (95), 3 (58), 4 (66)

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most, so we can give item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most, so we can give item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most, so we can give item 2 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated items 0, 1, and 2. We still need to allocate items 3 and 4.

4. For item 3, Agent 2 values it the second most after item 2, so give item 3 to Agent 2.
5. For item 4, Agent 1 values it the second most after item 1, so give item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
