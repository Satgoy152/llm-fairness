Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  76  86  67  91
1  39  21  72  94  30
2   0  57  71  10  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is as content as possible with their share.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values: [65, 76, 86, 67, 91]
   - Agent 1 values: [39, 21, 72, 94, 30]
   - Agent 2 values: [0, 57, 71, 10, 88]

2. **Evaluate Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (91).
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (94).
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (88), but it already is the highest for agent 0.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left are 0, 1, 2.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 2 should get their next highest valued item, which is item 2 (71).
   - Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 2 (86), but it's already allocated to Agent 2. So, Agent 0 should get item 1 (76).
   - The last item, item 0, will go to the agent who values it the most and hasn't reached a fair share. Agent 0 values it the most (65), but since they've already received two items, let's allocate it to Agent 2.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Items 0 and 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and it attempts to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.

{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
