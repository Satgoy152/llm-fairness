Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29   5  80  42  94
1  91  26  40  86  21
2  36  68  45  22  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Values the items as follows: [29, 5, 80, 42, 94]
- **Agent 1:** Values the items as follows: [91, 26, 40, 86, 21]
- **Agent 2:** Values the items as follows: [36, 68, 45, 22, 42]

We will try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while minimizing envy.

**Step 1: Highest Value Preference**

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 4 (value 94)
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 0 (value 91)
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 1 (value 68)

**Step 2: Initial Allocation**

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

**Step 3: Remaining Items**

Remaining items are 2 and 3. Let's allocate based on remaining preferences:

- **Agent 0:** Next highest preference is item 2 (value 80)
- **Agent 1:** Next highest preference is item 3 (value 86)
- **Agent 2:** Next highest preference is item 2 (value 45)

Given that Agent 1 highly values item 3, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1. This leaves item 2.

Since Agent 0 values item 2 the highest among the remaining agents after considering item 4, allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocations:**

- **Agent 0:** Items [4, 2]
- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 2:** Items [1]

This allocation is as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints because each agent receives their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet, and the remaining items are allocated to maximize the total value for each agent without creating unnecessary envy.

**Json Output:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1]
}
```
