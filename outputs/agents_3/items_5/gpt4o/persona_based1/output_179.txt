Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  19  79  56  55
1  11  21  44  34   8
2  81  86  90  69   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Here's one way to proceed:

1. **Assess Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values: 88, 19, 79, 56, 55. Total = 297
   - Agent 1 values: 11, 21, 44, 34, 8. Total = 118
   - Agent 2 values: 81, 86, 90, 69, 6. Total = 332

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for most items, especially item 2.
   - Agent 1 generally has the lowest valuations, making it tricky to satisfy envy-freeness.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Consider the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them such that the envy is minimized.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value of 90).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value of 88).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value of 86).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value of 56), as it’s their second-highest preference.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value of 8), as it’s the least valuable item and helps to balance the allocation.

The allocation leads to:
- Agent 0 getting items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 getting item 4.
- Agent 2 getting items 1 and 2.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest or second-highest valued items where possible, and ensures that each agent receives some items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
