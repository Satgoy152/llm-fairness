Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  66  48  71  73
1  77  26  39  59  70
2  23   8  41  26  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to allocate items in a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This problem falls under the category of fair division, where we aim to distribute items fairly among agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (73), 3 (71), 0 (70)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (77), 4 (70), 3 (59)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (41), 4 (35), 3 (26)

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0:** Highest value for Agent 1, so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Allocate to Agent 0, as it has relatively higher value for them.
- **Item 2:** Allocate to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for them.
- **Item 3:** Has high value for both Agent 0 and 1. Allocate to Agent 0 to balance the distribution.
- **Item 4:** Allocate to Agent 1, as it is the second highest valued item for them.

### Final Allocation:

After considering the values and ensuring that each agent gets items that they value highly, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent items they value relatively highly and attempts to minimize envy among the agents based on their valuations.
