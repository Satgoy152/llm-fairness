Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  86  99  21  10
1   4  61  25  92  49
2  15  69  25  79  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 61 25 92 49]
 [15 69 25 79 45]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, which means each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle, based on their valuations. To find such a division, we will consider the valuation matrix and the preferences of each agent. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [51, 86, 99, 21, 10]
- Agent 1 values: [4, 61, 25, 92, 49]
- Agent 2 values: [15, 69, 25, 79, 45]

A possible strategy for fair division is to assign items to agents based on their highest value preferences whilst ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item is item 2 with value 99, assign item 2.
   - Next highest value item is item 1 with value 86, assign item 1.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item is item 3 with value 92, assign item 3.
   - Next highest preference is item 4 with value 49, assign item 4.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining item 0 is assigned by default to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2]
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 4]
- Agent 2 receives item [0]

These allocations ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is based on their highest preferences, aiming to minimize envy.

    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
