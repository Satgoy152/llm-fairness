Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  37  78  99  61
1  53   9  40  13  96
2   4  33  74  75  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53  9 40 13 96]
 [ 4 33 74 75 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective.

### Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  37  78  99  61
1  53   9  40  13  96
2   4  33  74  75  33
```

### Objective:
Allocate the 5 items among the 3 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
- **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 4.
- **Agent 2** highly values items 2 and 3.

We aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness. One possible approach is:

1. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 93).
2. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 37).
3. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 74).
4. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 99).
5. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 96).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their most valued items, potentially minimizing envy.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
