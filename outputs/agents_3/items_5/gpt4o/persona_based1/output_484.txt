Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  99  52  62  47
1  24  70  16  53  59
2  49  63  23  40  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should try to maximize each agent's total valuation for their allocated items, keeping in mind that each agent's perceived value of the items they receive should be as balanced as possible across all agents. Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Valuation**: Assign items such that each agent's total valuation is as high as possible, given the constraints.

2. **Envy-freeness**: Ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: It significantly values items 0 and 1, having the highest valuations for these items among all agents. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 4, and moderate for item 3. Since item 1 is already allocated, we assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The remaining item, 2, is assigned to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations possible under these constraints and attempts to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
