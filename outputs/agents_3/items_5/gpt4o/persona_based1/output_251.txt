Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  83  45  69  32
1  35   2  95  79  24
2  97  83  33  20  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuations. A commonly used method to achieve this is to maximize the minimum valuation each agent has for their allocated items.

Let's first take a look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [12, 83, 45, 69, 32]
- Agent 1: [35, 2, 95, 79, 24]
- Agent 2: [97, 83, 33, 20, 58]

A simple approach is to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 35, and Agent 2 at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 2, and Agent 2 at 83.
   - Since Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it equally, we can allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the allocations.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 95, and Agent 2 at 33.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 at 79, and Agent 2 at 20.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 24, and Agent 2 at 58.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, we'll summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
