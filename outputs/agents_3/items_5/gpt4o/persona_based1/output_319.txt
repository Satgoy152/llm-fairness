Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  15   0  62  20
1  94  83  99  64  38
2   8  28  56  31  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. We aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 19     | 15     | 0      | 62     | 20     |
| 1     | 94     | 83     | 99     | 64     | 38     |
| 2     | 8      | 28     | 56     | 31     | 90     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuations for most items, especially Item 0 and Item 2. To prevent envy, we'll allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for this item (99).

2. **Agent 2** values Item 4 the most at 90. Therefore, we'll allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0** values Item 3 the most at 62. So, we'll allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, we have the following allocations:
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 0: Item 3

Remaining items are Item 0 and Item 1.

4. **Agent 1** values Item 0 the highest among the agents at 94, so we'll allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

5. **Agent 0** values Item 1 at 15 and Agent 2 at 28. We can allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 to balance the number of items among the agents slightly, as Agent 2 currently has only 1 item.

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 0, Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 1, Item 4

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the items are distributed considering the valuations to minimize envy.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
