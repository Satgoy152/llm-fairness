Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  47   1  52  42
1  26  44  97   7   5
2  76   5   3  47  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation where no agent envies another, meaning each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 28     | 47     | 1      | 52     | 42     |
| 1     | 26     | 44     | 97     | 7      | 5      |
| 2     | 76     | 5      | 3      | 47     | 62     |

We will try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 2** highly values Item 0 (76) and Item 4 (62). Allocating these items to Agent 2 will maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 2 (97). Allocating this item to Agent 1 will maximize their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 0** highly values Item 3 (52) and Item 1 (47). Allocating these items to Agent 0 will maximize their satisfaction.

By following this allocation strategy, we ensure that each agent receives their most valued items, minimizing the potential for envy. Let's verify:

- **Agent 0** receives Items 1 and 3, valued at 47 and 52, respectively.
- **Agent 1** receives Item 2, valued at 97.
- **Agent 2** receives Items 0 and 4, valued at 76 and 62, respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a combination of items that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
