Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  71  78  45  55
1  19  71  19  27  56
2  48  34  90  63  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Here, we will use a greedy approach by assigning items based on the highest valuation first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 71, but since we started with Agent 0, assign it to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 63.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 48.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, and 3.

This allocation respects the envy-free principle given the valuation matrix provided.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
