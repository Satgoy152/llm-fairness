Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  87   9  97  20
1  71  14  26  15  31
2  66   2  51  89  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 14 26 15 31]
 [66  2 51 89 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, based on their own valuation.

Let's examine the valuations of each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [49, 87, 9, 97, 20]
- Agent 1: [71, 14, 26, 15, 31]
- Agent 2: [66, 2, 51, 89, 42]

We can start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations to minimize envy. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 3**: This is most valued by Agent 0 with a value of 97, so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 71, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 87, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 42, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 2**: Finally, allocate item 2 to Agent 2, who values it second only to Agent 0, but since Agent 0 has already received two items, Agent 2 can receive this item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to minimize envy based on their highest valuations. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
