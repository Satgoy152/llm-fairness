Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  55  83  99  96
1  28  34  65   8  62
2  25  31  42  24  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. This doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but tries to ensure a fair distribution based on the given valuations. Let's evaluate the allocations step-by-step:

### Valuations by Agents:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 96

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 65
  - Item 3: 8
  - Item 4: 62

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 24
  - Item 4: 99

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Highest Valued Item Allocation:**
   - Allocate each agent the item they value the most, if possible, without conflicts.
   - If two agents value the same item the most, allocate the item to the agent who has the next highest valuation difference for another item.

2. **Round Allocation:**
   - Allocate items by rounds, ensuring each agent gets the highest remaining valued item.

**Allocation Process:**

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is Item 3 (99).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is Item 2 (65).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is Item 4 (99).

Remaining items: 0, 1

4. **Agent 0:** Next highest is Item 4 (96), but already allocated to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 1:** Next highest is Item 4 (62), but already allocated to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 2:** Second highest is Item 2 (42), but already allocated to Agent 1.

Now handle remaining items:
- **Item 0:** Allocate to Agent 1 (next highest value 28) since Agent 0 already has a high value item.
- **Item 1:** Allocate to Agent 0 (next highest value 55).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 0
- Agent 2: Item 4

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation strives to maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations and adheres to the constraint of allocating exactly 5 items.
