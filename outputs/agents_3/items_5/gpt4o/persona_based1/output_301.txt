Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  82  78  89  99
1  95  98  58   8  20
2  10  28   5  53  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, considering the valuations provided. The goal is to allocate all 5 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the distribution is fair.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [8, 82, 78, 89, 99]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [95, 98, 58, 8, 20]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [10, 28, 5, 53, 90]

A potential approach is to allocate the most valued item for each agent first and then adjust to ensure all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (98) and item 0 (95). To maximize fairness, we allocate these two highest valued items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (99). Assigning item 4 to Agent 0 would minimize their envy as it's their most valued item.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (90), but since item 4 is more critical to Agent 0, the next best option is item 3 (53), which is higher than the other available items.
4. **Agent 0** can be assigned item 2 (78), their second-highest remaining preference.
5. The remaining item 3, which was allocated to Agent 2, is Agent 2's best remaining option.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation tries to balance the agents' preferences and minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
