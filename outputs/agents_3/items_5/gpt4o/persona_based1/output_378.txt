Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  70  15   3  70
1  50  91  60  61  77
2  23  78  61  19  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent to their own. Given the valuations, we can try to find an allocation that meets these criteria. 

Let's consider the agents and their valuations:

- Agent 0: [8, 70, 15, 3, 70]
- Agent 1: [50, 91, 60, 61, 77]
- Agent 2: [23, 78, 61, 19, 37]

To start, we can look for items that are highly valued by a specific agent but not as much by others. This can guide us to a more envy-free allocation. 

1. **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 1 (91) and next by Agent 2 (78). Agent 0 values it at 70. Allocating this to Agent 1 makes sense as it's their highest value item and significantly more valuable to them compared to other items.
   
2. **Item 4** is also valued highly by Agent 1 (77), but since Item 1 has already been given to them, we should consider the next highest preference for this item. Agent 0 values it at 70, which is their highest value item, so let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 2 (61), which is also their highest value item. Thus, we can allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 1 (50) after their most valued items. For Agent 0, it's the least valuable, and for Agent 2, it's the second least. Allocating Item 0 to Agent 1 would be reasonable since Agent 1 has a high valuation of it and has already received the high-value Item 1.

5. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 1 (61) after their most valuable items. For Agent 0, it's the least valuable, and for Agent 2, it's also quite low. Since Agent 1 has already received two items, we can consider Agent 2, who values it at 19. Allocating Item 3 to Agent 2 balances the allocation better.

Given these considerations, the allocations can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation tries to minimize envy by giving each agent items that they value relatively more compared to the other agents' alternatives, while also ensuring that all 5 items are allocated.
