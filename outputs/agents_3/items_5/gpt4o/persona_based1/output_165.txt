Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  88   5  81  46
1  64  14  46  58  57
2  86  60  12   0  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly and in an envy-free manner, we can follow an approach where we maximize the minimum value each agent gets. This can help in ensuring that no one feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Let's evaluate the items based on their valuations and consider a fair distribution:

### Valuations Matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  88   5  81  46
1  64  14  46  58  57
2  86  60  12   0  61
```

### Steps to Fair Allocation:
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (88).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (64).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (86).

2. **Preliminary Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0 (highest value for agent 0).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2 (highest value for agent 2).
   - This leaves items 2, 3, and 4 to be allocated.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 already has item 1, with a high value of 88.
   - Agent 1 should get a high-value item next. Item 4 has a decent valuation of 57 for agent 1.
   - For the remaining items, we can try to balance based on remaining values:
     - Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 81, second-highest for agent 0).
     - Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 46, highest remaining for agent 1).

4. **Final Check**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1 (88) and 3 (81).
   - Agent 1: Items 2 (46) and 4 (57).
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (86).

This allocation should distribute the items fairly among the agents, considering their preferences and ensuring no agent is overly envious of another.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
