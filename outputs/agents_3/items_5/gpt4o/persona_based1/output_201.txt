Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  98  18  34  85
1  90  19   1  56  16
2  42  97  31  57   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (98) and item 0 the second highest (89).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (90) and item 3 the second highest (56).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (97) and item 3 the second highest (57).

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation can be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it the most (97).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the most (90).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it significantly (34) and others value it less.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it (85) and others value it less.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it (1) the least, but it's the least valued item overall.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy based on their respective valuations.
