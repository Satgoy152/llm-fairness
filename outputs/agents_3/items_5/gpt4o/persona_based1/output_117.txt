Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13   4   1  81  60
1  58  77  60  33  99
2  12  58  34  91   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple distribution method. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another. We can start by assigning items based on the highest value each agent places on an item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [13, 4, 1, 81, 60]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [58, 77, 60, 33, 99]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [12, 58, 34, 91, 4]

To perform a fair allocation, we can utilize the following strategy:

1. Assign the highest-valued item to each agent first, ensuring no conflicts.
2. Distribute remaining items based on the next highest available valuation.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- Agent 0: The highest valued item is item 3 (value 81).
- Agent 1: The highest valued item is item 4 (value 99).
- Agent 2: The highest valued item is item 3 (value 91), but since it’s taken by Agent 0, we assign item 1 (value 58).

Now, each agent has one item, and we need to assign the remaining items 0 and 2.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 58, the highest among agents (Agent 0 values it at 13, and Agent 2 at 12).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 60, the highest among agents (Agent 0 values it at 1, and Agent 2 at 34).

Now, let’s compile this into the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 0, 2],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and we have allocated all 5 items in total.
