Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  39  49  69  45
1  87  90  12   4  69
2  53  88  51  43  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [53 88 51 43 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider their valuations of the items and aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Here are the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 39, 49, 69, 45]
- Agent 1: [87, 90, 12, 4, 69]
- Agent 2: [53, 88, 51, 43, 77]

To achieve this, we can apply a simple allocation strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive.

1. **Assign items based on highest valuation per agent:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (90), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (69), so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (77), so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.

2. **Assign remaining items:**
   - The remaining items are 0 and 2. We look at the next highest valuations for these items:
     - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 87, which is the highest.
     - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 49, which is the highest.

3. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [2, 3]
   - Agent 1: [0, 1]
   - Agent 2: [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of the items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4]
}
```
