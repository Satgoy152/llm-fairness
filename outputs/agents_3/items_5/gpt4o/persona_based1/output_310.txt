Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  59  98   6  99
1   3  16   3  27  16
2  12   5  57  80  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free allocation, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the following approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:** Agent 0 highly values item 4 (99) and item 2 (98). These items should ideally be allocated to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:** Agent 1 values item 3 (27) the most. This item should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:** Agent 2 values item 3 (80) the most, but since it is already allocated to Agent 1, we can allocate item 0 (12) and item 1 (5) to Agent 2.

Given these preferences, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 4.
- **Agent 1** receives item 3.
- **Agent 2** receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items and ensures that all 5 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
