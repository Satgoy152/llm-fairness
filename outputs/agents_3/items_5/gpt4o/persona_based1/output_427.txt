Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  27  34  15  26
1  14  72  74  40  28
2  97  85   8  66  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to minimize envy by attempting to give each agent items that they value highly. This approach helps in making the allocation as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the situation:

**Agent Valuations:**
- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 53, Item 1 = 27, Item 2 = 34, Item 3 = 15, Item 4 = 26
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 14, Item 1 = 72, Item 2 = 74, Item 3 = 40, Item 4 = 28
- Agent 2 values: Item 0 = 97, Item 1 = 85, Item 2 = 8, Item 3 = 66, Item 4 = 71

**Strategy for Allocation:**
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most to minimize the potential for envy.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given the constraints.

**Allocation Steps:**
- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (97)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (85)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (74)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (66)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (71)

However, assigning all items based solely on highest valuation would result in Agent 2 receiving all items, which isn't a fair distribution. So, we need to reassess the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's adjust to distribute items fairly:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the interests of each agent by giving them at least one item of significant value to them.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
