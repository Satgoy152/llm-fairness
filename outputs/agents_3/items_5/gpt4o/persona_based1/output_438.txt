Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  30  78  63  87
1  12  83  89  91  36
2  62  80  47  82  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we should aim to give each agent a bundle of items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. This can be a challenging problem, but one approach is to use a method like the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) allocation, which aims to maximize the product of agents' utilities.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [33, 30, 78, 63, 87]
- Agent 1 values: [12, 83, 89, 91, 36]
- Agent 2 values: [62, 80, 47, 82, 11]

We will try to find a distribution of items that maximizes the fairness.

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**: This is the highest value for Agent 1, who values it at 91. 

2. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 at 87, which is their highest valuation among all items.

3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 highly, at 80, which is the highest among unallocated items.

4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 at 62. This choice complements the previous item allocation for Agent 2.

5. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 78, which is high and works well with their other allocated item.

After these allocations, each agent has received the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 0.

These allocations ensure that each agent receives a set of items that is relatively high in value according to their own valuations, aiming to minimize envy by maximizing the Nash welfare.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
