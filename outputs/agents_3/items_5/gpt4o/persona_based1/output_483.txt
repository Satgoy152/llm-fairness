Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  52  31  65  37
1  30  38  35  58  42
2  26  62  70  11  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible given the constraints. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

To start, let's summarize the value each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 37

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 58
  - Item 4: 42

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 11
  - Item 4: 76

Let's try to allocate these items to maximize the total value each agent receives while trying to minimize envy.

1. **Agent 2** highly values Item 4, so we can start by giving Item 4 to Agent 2. 
2. **Agent 0** highly values Item 3, so we can allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 compared to others, so we can allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, we have 2 items left (Items 1 and 2) and each agent has received at least one item. Let's allocate these remaining items by considering the next highest values:

4. **Agent 2** also highly values Item 2 (70), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 0** is left with Item 1, which they value at 52, a reasonable allocation considering their other item.

This allocation results in the following:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4

This allocation ensures that all agents get at least one item, and we attempt to make the distribution as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
