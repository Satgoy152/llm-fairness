Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  86  12  36  25
1   8  81  13  12  39
2  46  32  28  48  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items**: This helps in understanding which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Greedy allocation**: Begin by allocating items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that the total allocation remains envy-free.

3. **Adjust if necessary**: If any agent ends up with an allocation they envy, adjust by swapping items between agents until no agent prefers another's allocation.

In this case, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the most (value = 86).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (value = 81), but item 4 is the next highest (value = 39).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most (value = 66), then item 3 (value = 48).

Given these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it highly and it's their top choice.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it and it balances their allocation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it adds to their allocation and minimizes envy.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they have a moderate valuation for it, and it avoids envy from Agent 2.

These allocations aim to balance valuations and minimize envy among agents. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy.
