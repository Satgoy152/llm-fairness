Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26   4  10  40  37
1  43  45   9  55  88
2  20  53  95   7  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations, we can use the method of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Consider the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (40).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (95).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Items left are 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (43) compared to other agents, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 highly (53), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, aiming for envy-freeness.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items they value highly, reducing the likelihood of envy.
