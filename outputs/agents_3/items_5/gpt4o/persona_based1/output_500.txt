Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39   7  79  91  89
1  70  51  62  40  90
2  87  18  80  62  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. Envy-freeness means that an agent should not prefer another agent's bundle of items over their own. Given the valuations of the agents, we can attempt to allocate the items to ensure a fair distribution according to their preferences.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (91), followed by item 4 (89), item 2 (79), item 0 (39), and item 1 (7).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (90), followed by item 0 (70), item 2 (62), item 1 (51), and item 3 (40).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (87), followed by item 2 (80), item 3 (62), item 1 (18), and item 4 (37).

A possible fair allocation that considers these preferences could be:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their most valued item.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their most valued item.

Now, we have items 1 and 2 left to allocate. Let's continue:

4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 to increase their total value, as it is their third most valued item and it is not as valuable to the other agents as their assigned items.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 to ensure they get a second item, which balances the distribution better.

This allocation should not create significant envy, as each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and the remaining items are distributed to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0]
}
```
