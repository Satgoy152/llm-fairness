Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  10  13  65  26
1  54  81  80  62   0
2  55  74  10  81   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that satisfies envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of others. Given the table of valuations, let's consider the preferences of each agent for the items:

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 65
  - Item 4: 26

- **Agent 1** values: 
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 62
  - Item 4: 0

- **Agent 2** values: 
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 0

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations while attempting to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation significantly. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (65)
   - Second choice: Item 0 (48)
   - Allocate Items 3 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (81)
   - Second choice: Item 2 (80)
   - Allocate Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (81) - already allocated
   - Next choice: Item 0 (55) - already allocated
   - Next available highest: Item 1 (74) - already allocated
   - Given Agents 0 and 1 already have better allocations, allocate remaining Item 4 (0 value) to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent items that are among their highest valued, while ensuring each item is allocated once.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 5 items are allocated.
