Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  76  84  85  40
1  83  88  56  32  94
2  91   1  60  46  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their perceived value while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Sum the valuations for each agent across all items to get a sense of their total valuation towards the set of items.
   
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 45 + 76 + 84 + 85 + 40 = 330
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 83 + 88 + 56 + 32 + 94 = 353
   - Agent 2's total valuation: 91 + 1 + 60 + 46 + 52 = 250

2. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation**: We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, thus reducing envy.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Consider allocating item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (88).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (91).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (84).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (94).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (85).

4. **Check for Envy**: We attempt to allocate items in such a way that minimizes envy by giving agents items they have high valuation for.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 2 receives item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are most valuable to them, minimizing envy to the extent possible. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
