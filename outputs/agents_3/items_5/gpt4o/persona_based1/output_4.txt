Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  15  70  87  93
1  82   0  18  61  30
2  11  91  90  70  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible given the constraints.

### Initial Analysis
- **Agent 0** highly values items 3 and 4.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0.
- **Agent 2** highly values items 1 and 4.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign items with high personal valuation: items 3 and 4 are highly valued by Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items that are highly valued by Agent 1: item 0 is the most valued.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items that are highly valued by Agent 2: items 1 and 2.

### Final Allocation
We ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. The allocation should be such that it tries to minimize envy, though perfect envy-freeness is hard to achieve in this discrete scenario.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 4] (valuations: 87, 93)
- **Agent 1**: Item [0] (valuation: 82)
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2] (valuations: 91, 90)

### Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with their most valued items while ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.
