Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3   0  51  85  36
1  26  15  45  19  89
2  95  71  94  56  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 15 45 19 89]
 [95 71 94 56 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we typically aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations in the table, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least something they value relatively highly, minimizing potential envy.

### Valuations Table:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 0, 51, 85, 36]
- **Agent 1**: [26, 15, 45, 19, 89]
- **Agent 2**: [95, 71, 94, 56, 49]

### Strategy:
1. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item the most (85), so it makes sense to give it to them.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has the highest value for this item (89), so it should go to them.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this the highest (95), so it should be allocated to them.
4. **Item 2**: Agent 2 has a high valuation (94), so it should be allocated to them.
5. **Item 1**: Agent 2 also values this item highly (71), so it should be allocated to them.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 2.

This allocation attempts to reduce envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one item they highly value. 

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
