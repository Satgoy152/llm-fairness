Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  31  79  93  64
1  94  74   3  37  79
2  75   3  74  35   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 74  3 37 79]
 [75  3 74 35  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [45, 31, 79, 93, 64]
Agent 1: [94, 74, 3, 37, 79]
Agent 2: [75, 3, 74, 35, 0]
```

We first determine the most preferred items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values items 3 and 2 highly (93 and 79).
- Agent 1 values items 0 and 1 highly (94 and 74).
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 2 highly (75 and 74).

To ensure fairness and minimize envy, consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (most valued by Agent 0) and item 4 (second highest value after item 2, which is highly valued by Agent 2 as well).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (highest value for Agent 1) and item 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their more preferred items and minimizes the potential for envy given the constraints.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
