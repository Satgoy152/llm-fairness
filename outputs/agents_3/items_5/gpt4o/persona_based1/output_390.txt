Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  79  37  16  86
1  36  70  91  72  56
2  74  26  52  34  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. One commonly used method is the Envy-Free criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's assess the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Item 0 at 24
  - Item 1 at 79
  - Item 2 at 37
  - Item 3 at 16
  - Item 4 at 86

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0 at 36
  - Item 1 at 70
  - Item 2 at 91
  - Item 3 at 72
  - Item 4 at 56

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Item 0 at 74
  - Item 1 at 26
  - Item 2 at 52
  - Item 3 at 34
  - Item 4 at 34

A reasonable approach to ensure fairness is to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets the items they value the most, while keeping in mind the overall distribution.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items based on each agent's highest-valued items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and no item is assigned twice.

#### Steps:
1. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the most (91), so we assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 4 the most (86), so we assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 0 the most (74), so we assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** values Item 3 second most (72), so we assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. The remaining item, Item 1, is valued second most by Agent 0 (79), so we assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
