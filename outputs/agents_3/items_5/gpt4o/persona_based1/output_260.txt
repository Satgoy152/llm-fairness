Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  81  20  87  81
1   4  27  47  69  91
2  74  38  69  38  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [36, 81, 20, 87, 81]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [4, 27, 47, 69, 91]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [74, 38, 69, 38, 10]

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, and no one envies another's allocation.

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each agent the items for which they have the highest relative value compared to other agents, keeping in mind that all items must be allocated.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (74). Assign to Agent 2.
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation (81). Assign to Agent 0.
   
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation (69). Assign to Agent 2.
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation (87). Assign to Agent 0.
   
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (91). Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation seems to offer a fair distribution based on the highest valuations for each item, minimizing envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

Now, representing this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
