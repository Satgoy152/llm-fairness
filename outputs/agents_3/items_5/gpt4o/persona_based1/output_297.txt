Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  41  39   5  79
1   0  52  50  35   3
2   5   1  76  46  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as fairly as possible, minimizing envy among the agents. One approach is to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated, and no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Here's an analysis of the valuations:

- **Agent 0** has high values for item 0 and item 4.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 and item 1 highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the most, followed by item 3.

Considering these valuations, we strive to allocate items in a way that respects these preferences as much as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 4. These are the items they value the highest.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1. This is the most valuable item available after Agent 0's allocation.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 and 3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest among all items, and item 3 is also valued highly.

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
