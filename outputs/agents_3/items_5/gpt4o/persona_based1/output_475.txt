Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  53  52  52  71
1  56  27  81  47  76
2  60  50  51  65  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [60 50 51 65 94]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. One common approach to achieve this is by maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, ensuring that no agent envies another's bundle based on their own valuation.

Let's evaluate different possible allocations and try to find one that maximizes fairness. We aim to balance the total value received by each agent according to their valuations.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0 values: [39, 53, 52, 52, 71]
- Agent 1 values: [56, 27, 81, 47, 76]
- Agent 2 values: [60, 50, 51, 65, 94]

Here's a possible allocation strategy:
1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most (94).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (81).
3. Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, which maximizes Agent 0â€™s total value for these items (39 + 53 = 92).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as this increases Agent 1's total value significantly (47).

Let's check the total values:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1] with total value = 39 + 53 = 92
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3] with total value = 81 + 47 = 128
- Agent 2 receives item [4] with total value = 94

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with the highest possible value according to their own valuation, minimizing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
