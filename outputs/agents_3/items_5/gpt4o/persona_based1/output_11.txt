Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  22  61  76  85
1  90  75  25  56  94
2  67  35  75  19  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own given their individual valuations. We will analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0** values: [75, 22, 61, 76, 85]
- **Agent 1** values: [90, 75, 25, 56, 94]
- **Agent 2** values: [67, 35, 75, 19, 12]

### Initial Observations:
- **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 2.
- **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 0.
- **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 1.

### Strategy:
1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring we achieve an envy-free allocation.
2. Adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 5.

### Allocation:
- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 1** (highest valuation).
- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 1** (highest valuation).
- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 2** (highest valuation).
- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 0** (highest valuation).
- Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 0** (next highest valuation after Agent 1).

This allocation ensures:
- Each agent receives at least one item.
- The allocation respects the highest individual valuations for most items.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with no agent preferring another's allocation over their own given their individual preferences.
