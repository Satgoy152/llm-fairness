Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  86  76  54  77
1  90  64  37  76  81
2  67   4  53  77  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of discrete allocations (i.e., each item can only be given to one agent).

Here are the steps to reach a fair allocation:

1. **List Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [30, 86, 76, 54, 77]
   - Agent 1: [90, 64, 37, 76, 81]
   - Agent 2: [67, 4, 53, 77, 84]

2. **Determine Preferences**:
   - Agent 0 prefers item 1 the most (value 86), followed by item 4 (value 77).
   - Agent 1 prefers item 0 the most (value 90), followed by item 4 (value 81).
   - Agent 2 prefers item 4 the most (value 84), followed by item 3 (value 77).

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent:
     - Agent 0 gets item 1
     - Agent 1 gets item 0
     - Agent 2 gets item 4

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items are 2 and 3. We will allocate these to minimize envy.
   - Agent 0 has not received their second-highest preference, which is item 4 (already taken), so we consider their next preference (item 2).
   - Agent 1 has their highest preference and might be satisfied.
   - Agent 2 has their highest preference and might be satisfied.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next preference).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next preference).

6. **Review**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 1: Item 0
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 4

This allocation attempts to balance the valuation among the agents and minimizes envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
