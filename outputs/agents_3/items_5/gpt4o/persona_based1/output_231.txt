Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  36   7  93  99
1  18  77   5  23  90
2  53  91  88  58  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division that strives for envy-freeness, we should first try to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. There are multiple ways to approach this problem, such as through algorithms like the Envy-Free Matching or Maximum Nash Welfare. However, given the simplicity of the problem (3 agents and 5 items), we can try to manually find a solution that seems fair.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations each agent has for each item and try to allocate items such that agents receive items they value highly, while also ensuring that the overall distribution is balanced.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for items 1 and 2.

To achieve a fair allocation, we should try to meet these preferences as much as possible:

- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: Valuation of 81 (highest for Agent 0).
- **Allocate item 1 to Agent 2**: Valuation of 91 (highest for Agent 2).
- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**: Valuation of 88 (highest for Agent 2, and Agent 0 and 1 have low valuations).
- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: Valuation of 93 (highest for Agent 0).
- **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: Valuation of 90 (highest for Agent 1).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their highest-valued items, and no agent receives no items. The allocation also tries to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly.

The final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, with Agent 0 and Agent 2 receiving two items each, and Agent 1 receiving one item. This allocation balances the total valuations each agent receives as much as possible given the constraints.
