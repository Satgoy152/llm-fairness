Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  67  83  39  45
1  22  27  69  49  79
2  59  23  65  94  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness. This means that each agent should feel that their own allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to any other agent, based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 30     | 67     | 83     | 39     | 45     |
| 1     | 22     | 27     | 69     | 49     | 79     |
| 2     | 59     | 23     | 65     | 94     | 70     |

A good approach is to try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction and minimize envy. Here's a plausible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High valuation for items 1 and 2.
   - Allocate items 1 and 2.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuation for item 4.
   - Allocate item 4.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuation for items 0 and 3.
   - Allocate items 0 and 3.

Let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0's allocation:** Items 1 and 2 with values 67 and 83, total = 150.
- **Agent 1's allocation:** Item 4 with value 79.
- **Agent 2's allocation:** Items 0 and 3 with values 59 and 94, total = 153.

Each agent receives items they value highly, and the allocation attempts to balance satisfaction across agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
