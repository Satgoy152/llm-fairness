Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  34   8  20  50
1  32  81   0  57  23
2  34  61  74  59  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. We will use a simple method to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation is as fair as possible given the valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item** and allocate that item to the agent who values it the most. This helps in minimizing envy as each agent gets an item they highly value.

2. **Check if any agents have not received an item** and reallocate if necessary to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Distribute remaining items** based on remaining highest valuations.

Here's the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 32, and Agent 0 values it at 31. It goes to Agent 2.

- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest valuation for any item. It goes to Agent 1.

- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 74, which is the highest valuation for this item. It goes to Agent 2.

- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 57, which is the highest valuation for this item. It goes to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 50, which is the highest valuation for this item. It goes to Agent 0.

With this allocation, we ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and it minimizes envy by assigning items based on maximum valuations.
