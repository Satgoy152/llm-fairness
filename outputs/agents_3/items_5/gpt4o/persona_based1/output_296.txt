Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  59  95  22  24
1   5  71  51  17  54
2  70  80  35  13  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple approach by maximizing the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring no agent envies another. One common method is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of individual valuations for the items assigned to each agent.

Here's one way to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 95.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 71.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 80, but item 1 is already assigned.
   - The next highest value is item 0 at 70.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have assigned 3 out of 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (3 and 4).

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 17, and Agent 2 at 13.
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
   
   - For item 4:
     - Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 54, and Agent 2 at 65.
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, and no agent feels envious of another.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
