Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  66  49  60  64
1  51  53  61  51  92
2  41  84  21  45  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair allocation problem, we need to distribute the 5 items among the 3 agents in a way that considers their valuations and ensures fairness in terms of envy-freeness, if possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [8, 66, 49, 60, 64]
- Agent 1: [51, 53, 61, 51, 92]
- Agent 2: [41, 84, 21, 45, 46]

We aim to allocate these items such that each agent receives at least one item (if possible), and their perceived value from the allocation is as balanced as possible.

### Initial Observations:
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1, but since Agent 0 also values it highly, it may not be straightforward.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valued item and not highly valued by others.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is a middle-ground choice, and Agent 2 has no items yet.
5. Finally, allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it provides them with additional value without causing envy.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.

    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
