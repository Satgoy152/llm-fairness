Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46   2  23  41  41
1  70   6  65  95  85
2  81  87  58  77  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to give each agent a bundle of items that they value without causing envy among other agents. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations provided in the table, we will attempt to distribute the items to achieve this goal.

Let's start by examining the preferences of each agent for each item:

- **Agent 0's valuations:** 
  - Item 0: 46, Item 1: 2, Item 2: 23, Item 3: 41, Item 4: 41

- **Agent 1's valuations:** 
  - Item 0: 70, Item 1: 6, Item 2: 65, Item 3: 95, Item 4: 85

- **Agent 2's valuations:** 
  - Item 0: 81, Item 1: 87, Item 2: 58, Item 3: 77, Item 4: 82

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for Item 1 (87) among all agents. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 3 (95) and Item 4 (85). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (46) after accounting for Agent 2's preference for Item 1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 1** has a significant valuation for Item 4 (85). Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

5. **Agent 2** values Item 2 (58) relatively high compared to other agents. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Let's review the allocations to ensure they are envy-free. 

- Agent 0 receives Item 0, which they value at 46.
- Agent 1 receives Items 3 and 4, which they value at 95 and 85, respectively.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 2, which they value at 87 and 58, respectively.

These allocations give each agent items that they value highly, and they should not prefer others' allocations over their own.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
