Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  85  52  86  43
1   2  32  18  12  19
2  27  75  76  72  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free division, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items they value such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. Since we have three agents and five items, each agent should receive at least one item, and one agent will receive an extra item.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [29, 85, 52, 86, 43]
- Agent 1 values: [2, 32, 18, 12, 19]
- Agent 2 values: [27, 75, 76, 72, 20]

A possible fair allocation strategy is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring everyone gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Allocate item 1** to Agent 0. This is their second highest valued item and prevents them from envying others significantly.
2. **Allocate item 2** to Agent 2. This is their highest valued item and prevents significant envy from others.
3. **Allocate item 3** to Agent 0. This is their highest valued item and complements their allocation with item 1.
4. **Allocate item 4** to Agent 1. This is the highest valued item available to Agent 1 after the other allocations.
5. **Allocate item 0** to Agent 2. This item boosts Agent 2's total valuation without causing significant envy from others.

Calculating the totals:
- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3] with a total valuation of 85 + 86 = 171.
- Agent 1 gets item [4] with a total valuation of 19.
- Agent 2 gets items [2, 0] with a total valuation of 76 + 27 = 103.

This allocation ensures fairness and minimizes envy due to the high individual valuations of the chosen items for each agent.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
