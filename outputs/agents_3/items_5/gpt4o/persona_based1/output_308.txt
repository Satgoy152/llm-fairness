Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  75  3  52  94  18
1  10  6  13  82  93
2  81  5   1  87   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that ensures envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation of the items. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List each agent’s total valuation for all items**:
   - Agent 0: 75 + 3 + 52 + 94 + 18 = 242
   - Agent 1: 10 + 6 + 13 + 82 + 93 = 204
   - Agent 2: 81 + 5 + 1 + 87 + 5 = 179

2. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 94.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 93.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 81.

3. **Assign the most valued items to each agent first**:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Remaining items are 1 and 2.
   - Evaluate remaining valuations:
     - Agent 0: Item 1 (3), Item 2 (52)
     - Agent 1: Item 1 (6), Item 2 (13)
     - Agent 2: Item 1 (5), Item 2 (1)

5. **Assign items based on highest remaining valuations to ensure fairness**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest remaining valuation at 52).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation at 6).

This allocation ensures no agent envies another, as each has received their highest valued item or fair consideration of what remains.
