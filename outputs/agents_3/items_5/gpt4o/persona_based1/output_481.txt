Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  77  56  66   9
1  24  91  26  71  49
2  86  85  43   5  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 91 26 71 49]
 [86 85 43  5 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their individual valuations.

One approach to achieve this is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar methods, but given the small number of items and agents, we can manually find a fair allocation through inspection and comparison of valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
       0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0: 76  77  56  66   9
Agent 1: 24  91  26  71  49
Agent 2: 86  85  43   5  18
```

From the valuations, we can see:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (76) and 1 (77).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (91) and item 3 (71).
- Agent 2 highly values items 0 (86) and 1 (85).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (86).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (91).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a relatively high valuation for it (56) compared to others.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (71).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it balances their overall allocation and they have a low valuation for it (9), minimizing envy.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

This allocation is a fair division based on the given valuations, as each agent receives items they value and there is no obvious envy.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
