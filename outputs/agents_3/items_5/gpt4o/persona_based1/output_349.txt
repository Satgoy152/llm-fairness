Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5   0  65  96  35
1  57  49  75  77  81
2  46  91  63  22  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total welfare while trying to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   5   0  65  96  35
1  57  49  75  77  81
2  46  91  63  22  57
```

We'll first calculate the total value each agent receives from a subset of items and attempt to distribute items in a way that respects their preferences as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible).

### Step-by-step Allocation Approach:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3.
   - Agent 1 has relatively high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.
   - Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 1.

2. **Assigning the Highest Valued Items**:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 96, highest for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value = 91, highest for Agent 2).

3. **Remaining Items and Balancing**:
   - With items 3 and 1 assigned, the remaining items are 0, 2, and 4.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 also values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - The remaining item 0 can be assigned to Agent 0.

By this allocation, we try to balance the high-value items among agents and ensure each agent gets at least one item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that respects their preferences as much as possible based on their valuations.
