Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  77  33  33  86
1  51  18  95  22  78
2  89  21  27  56  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation of items over their own. Let's use the valuations table to guide our allocations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 53     | 77     | 33     | 33     | 86     |
| 1     | 51     | 18     | 95     | 22     | 78     |
| 2     | 89     | 21     | 27     | 56     | 45     |

The goal is to allocate items so that each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (86). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (95). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (89). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items, Items 1 and 3.

4. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 77.
   - Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Agent 2 values it at 21.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

5. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 33.
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - Agent 2 values it at 56.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

The allocations can be represented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items, while ensuring no agent envies the allocation of another.
