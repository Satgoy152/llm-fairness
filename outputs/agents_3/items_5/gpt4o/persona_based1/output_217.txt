Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  97  20  94  23
1  79  92  37  49  31
2   1  19  23  36  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we should aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, if possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One popular method for this is the "Envy-Free" allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

**Valuations Table:**

| Agents \ Items | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|----------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0              | 45 | 97 | 20 | 94 | 23 |
| 1              | 79 | 92 | 37 | 49 | 31 |
| 2              | 1  | 19 | 23 | 36 | 90 |

Here's a strategy to distribute these items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers item 1 (value 97) and item 3 (value 94).
   - Receives items: [1, 3].

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Prefers item 0 (value 79) and item 2 (value 37).
   - Receives items: [0, 2].

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Prefers item 4 (value 90).
   - Receives item: [4].

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one high-valued item based on their preferences, and each item is allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraint that each agent gets a whole number of items and all items are allocated.
