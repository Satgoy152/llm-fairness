Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  67  24  20  18
1  35  11  42  57  35
2  91  93  56  53  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the principle of envy-freeness, which ensures that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. Given the valuations provided, we will attempt to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy and ensures fairness.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 30 + 67 + 24 + 20 + 18 = 159
- Agent 1: 35 + 11 + 42 + 57 + 35 = 180
- Agent 2: 91 + 93 + 56 + 53 + 83 = 376

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation on the majority of items, so they should receive the items they value most to minimize envy. We'll start by allocating items to Agent 2.

   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 93).
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 83).

2. Next, we'll allocate items with consideration to the remaining values for Agents 0 and 1:

   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 57), as this is the highest value item for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 30), as this is the highest value item for Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 42), as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that every agent values their set of items reasonably well without causing significant envy. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation should ensure a relatively fair distribution based on the given valuations.
