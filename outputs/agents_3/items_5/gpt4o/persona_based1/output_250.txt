Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  40   2  61  55
1  59  63  62  93  50
2  42  75  95  35  15
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [42 75 95 35 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 40, 2, 61, 55]
- Agent 1: [59, 63, 62, 93, 50]
- Agent 2: [42, 75, 95, 35, 15]

We can use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring no envy among the allocations. The goal is to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

1. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 93, and no other agent values it higher.
2. **Assign item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 95, and no other agent values it higher.
3. **Assign item 4 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 at 55, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation (15) and lower than Agent 1's valuation (50), but Agent 1 already has item 3.
4. **Assign item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 at 75, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (40) and less than Agent 1's (63), but it's not possible to give it to Agent 1 since it would create imbalance.
5. **Assign item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 59, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (5) and Agent 2's valuation (42).

This allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints of integer item allocations. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
