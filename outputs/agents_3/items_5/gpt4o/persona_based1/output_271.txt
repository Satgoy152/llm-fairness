Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  52  77  22  47
1  84  15  51  97  30
2  93  74  48  95  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 15 51 97 30]
 [93 74 48 95 76]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to minimize envy among the agents. A common approach is to use an algorithm that looks for an envy-free allocation if possible, or at least an allocation that minimizes envy.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [24, 52, 77, 22, 47]
- Agent 1: [84, 15, 51, 97, 30]
- Agent 2: [93, 74, 48, 95, 76]

Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible based on their preferences.

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (93) and item 1 (74). Allocating these two items to agent 2 will maximize their satisfaction.
   
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (97). Allocating item 3 to agent 1 will satisfy their strongest preference.

3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (77) among the unallocated items. Allocating item 2 to agent 0 will maximize their satisfaction for this item.

4. Finally, item 4 remains unallocated. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (76), but since agent 2 already has two items, we need to consider the remaining agents. Between agents 0 and 1, agent 0 has a valuation of 47 for item 4, which is higher than agent 1's valuation of 30. Therefore, allocate item 4 to agent 0.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
