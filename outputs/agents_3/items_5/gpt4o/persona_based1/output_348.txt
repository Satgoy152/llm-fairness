Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  84  14  42  72
1  93  74  96  84  20
2  40  72  42  16  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we will use a heuristic approach to attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation.

Let's first consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 51, 84, 14, 42, 72
- Agent 1 values: 93, 74, 96, 84, 20
- Agent 2 values: 40, 72, 42, 16, 68

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

A potential allocation could be based on maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring as balanced a distribution as possible:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 84).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 93).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 96).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 68).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 42).

This allocation provides the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 84 + 42 = 126
- Agent 1: 93 + 96 = 189
- Agent 2: 68

While not perfectly balanced, this allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation is a heuristic attempt to balance valuations and may not be completely envy-free, but it respects the constraints and provides a fair distribution of items.
