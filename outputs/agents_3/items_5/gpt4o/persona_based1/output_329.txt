Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  49  13  72  82
1  55  11  63  97  45
2  56  42  34  28  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or overall satisfaction. Let's consider each agent's valuation and attempt to allocate items to balance the perceived values among agents. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent \ Item  0   1   2   3   4
0            2  49  13  72  82
1           55  11  63  97  45
2           56  42  34  28  95
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (82) and item 3 (72).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (97) and item 2 (63).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (95) and item 0 (56).

**Initial Allocation Attempt Based on Highest Valuations:**
- Agent 0 takes item 4.
- Agent 1 takes item 3.
- Agent 2 takes item 0.

**Remaining Items:**
- Items 1 and 2 need to be allocated.

**Assess Remaining Item Valuations:**
- Agent 0 values item 1 (49) and item 2 (13).
- Agent 1 values item 1 (11) and item 2 (63).
- Agent 2 values item 1 (42) and item 2 (34).

**Allocate Remaining Items:**
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest remaining valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest remaining valuation for Agent 1).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 2
- Agent 2: Item 0

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the fairness by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, while also attempting to balance the overall distribution of values among the agents.
