Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  71   9  64  49
1  19  89  30  41  13
2  19  44  93  38  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to make the allocation as envy-free (or nearly envy-free) as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received the best possible bundle of items given the circumstances.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 49

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 13

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 37

To achieve a fair allocation, let's prioritize assigning items to agents based on their highest values.

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item the highest (93), and it is also their highest valuation. This allocation reduces potential envy from Agent 2.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest (89), which is also their highest valuation. This allocation reduces potential envy from Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 quite highly (64), which is one of their highest valuations.

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 31, which complements their allocation and maximizes their total valuation.

5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2**: With item 2 already allocated to Agent 2, item 4 (valued at 37) is a reasonable complement to enhance Agent 2's overall satisfaction.

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives and minimize envy by giving each agent some of their highest-valued items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
