Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  70  51  36   0
1  17  83  49  27  47
2  65  87  21  68  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll strive to achieve this by considering the agents' valuations and trying to balance the total value of the items each agent receives.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0** has the following valuations: [49, 70, 51, 36, 0].
2. **Agent 1** has the following valuations: [17, 83, 49, 27, 47].
3. **Agent 2** has the following valuations: [65, 87, 21, 68, 26].

Let's allocate items by attempting to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item highest (65), so we assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item highest (87), so we assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item highest (51), so we assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this item highest (68), so we assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item highest (47), so we assign it to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [2]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to distribute the items according to the highest valuation for each item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of distributing exactly 5 items and ensures each agent receives items based on their highest preferences.
