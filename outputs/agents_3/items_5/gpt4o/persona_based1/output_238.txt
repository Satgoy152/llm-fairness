Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  92  81  20  20
1  94  28  58  91  46
2  84  43  62  19  20
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [1, 92, 81, 20, 20]
- Agent 1: [94, 28, 58, 91, 46]
- Agent 2: [84, 43, 62, 19, 20]

We can approach this problem by assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. Let's try to allocate items using a simple method where we aim to give each agent their highest valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest with a valuation of 94, so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest with a valuation of 92, so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest with a valuation of 62, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 1 values item 3 the second highest with a valuation of 91, so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. The remaining item 4 is valued equally by agent 0 and agent 2, but agent 1 has already received two items. To balance the allocations, we assign item 4 to agent 0.

Here's the allocation for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible, given the constraint of distributing all items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```
