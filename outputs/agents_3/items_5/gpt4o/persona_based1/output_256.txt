Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  12  80   2  90
1  46  81  35  43  10
2  32  76  17  82  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations and try to make the allocation envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [51, 12, 80, 2, 90]
- Agent 1: [46, 81, 35, 43, 10]
- Agent 2: [32, 76, 17, 82, 45]

We will attempt to find an allocation that maximizes each agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values items 2 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3.

Given these priorities, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 80 for Agent 0).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 90 for Agent 0).
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 81 for Agent 1).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 82 for Agent 2).
- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 46 for Agent 1).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 2 and 4, Agent 1 items 0 and 1, and Agent 2 item 3. Each agent receives items that they value highly, and the allocation is as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.
