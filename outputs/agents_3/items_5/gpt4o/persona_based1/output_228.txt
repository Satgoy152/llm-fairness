Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  41  92  28  18
1  14  37  48  77  83
2  71  37  10  11  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while aiming to achieve an envy-free allocation, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4
-----------|-------------------
    0      | 30  41  92  28  18
    1      | 14  37  48  77  83
    2      | 71  37  10  11  82
```

### Steps to Allocate Items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for items that are highly valued by a particular agent compared to others.

2. **Initial Assignments**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since they value it the highest at 92.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest at 77.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest at 82.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - For item 0, Agent 2 values it at 71, which is significantly higher than the others. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 41, which is the highest value among the agents. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

The allocations are made with the goal of minimizing envy, assigning items such that each agent receives a bundle that they value highly.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

Each agent has items that they value highly, and the distribution aims to be as envy-free as possible given the valuations.
