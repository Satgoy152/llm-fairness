Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  33  68  72   9
1  25   7  13  76  22
2   9  71  70  93  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The key objective here is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. We assume each agent receives at least one item, based on the problem statement.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Has high valuations for items 2 (68) and 3 (72).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Has a high valuation for item 3 (76).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Has high valuations for item 3 (93) and item 1 (71).

Given the high valuations for item 3 by all agents, let's prioritize its allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 2** gets item 3 (highest value 93) and item 1.
- **Agent 1** gets item 4 (value 22).
- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 2 (since these are relatively higher for them compared to other items).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and it minimizes potential envy.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 5.
