Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  72  45  78  66
1  35  64  37  59   0
2  97  35  22  21  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 35 22 21 14]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [8, 72, 45, 78, 66]
Agent 1: [35, 64, 37, 59, 0]
Agent 2: [97, 35, 22, 21, 14]
```

A fair allocation strategy could involve assigning items based on maximizing each agent's total value while trying to minimize envy. Here is one possible approach:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (97). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (78). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 0** also values item 1 highly (72). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (59), but it's already taken. Assign item 2 (value 37) to Agent 1.
5. The remaining item 4 is valued highest by **Agent 0** (66), but Agent 1 might feel less envious if they also receive item 4 (value 0, but it balances the allocation).

So, the allocations could be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 0

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on each agentâ€™s valuation while ensuring all items are assigned. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
