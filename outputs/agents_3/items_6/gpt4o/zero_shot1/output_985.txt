Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  68  98  73  30  54
1  25  29   7  17  87  68
2  58  96  89   7  38  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's start by evaluating the items' valuations for each agent:

**Agent 0**:
- Item 0: 2
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 98
- Item 3: 73
- Item 4: 30
- Item 5: 54

**Agent 1**:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 87
- Item 5: 68

**Agent 2**:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 96
- Item 2: 89
- Item 3: 7
- Item 4: 38
- Item 5: 35

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 2 the highest (98). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 4 the highest (87). Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 1 the highest (96). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

Now we have:
- Agent 0 has Item 2.
- Agent 1 has Item 4.
- Agent 2 has Item 1.

Next, we allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 5) by considering the next highest valuations:

4. **Agent 0** values Item 3 next highest (73). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values Item 5 next highest (68). Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** values Item 0 next highest (58). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now we have:
- Agent 0 has Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has Items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 has Items 1 and 0.

The allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
