Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55   6  57  87  37  86
1  75  69   4  24  10  29
2   6  94  89  46  84  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 69  4 24 10 29]
 [ 6 94 89 46 84 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 highly.
2. Agent 1 values items 0 and 1 highly.
3. Agent 2 values items 1 and 4 highly.

Let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 2 and 5. (Values: 57 and 86)
- Agent 1: Allocate items 0 and 1. (Values: 75 and 69)
- Agent 2: Allocate items 3 and 4. (Values: 46 and 84)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and optimizes their total valuation based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
