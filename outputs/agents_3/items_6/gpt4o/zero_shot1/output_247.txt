Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  13  17  24  95  49
1  73  74  48  74  37  90
2  49  35  14  69  70  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 74 48 74 37 90]
 [49 35 14 69 70 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Allocate the highest valued item for each agent first:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 95)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 74)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 69)

2. Allocate the remaining items based on remaining valuations:
   - For Agent 0: After item 4, the next highest is item 5 (value 49)
   - For Agent 1: After item 1, the next highest is item 5, but since it's already allocated, next is item 2 (value 48)
   - For Agent 2: After item 3, the next highest is item 0 (value 49)

3. Check the current allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 0

4. Adjust to ensure each item is allocated and each agent has at least one item:
   - Agent 0: Items 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 0, 2

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 0, 2]
}
```
