Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  38  89  92  59  14
1  71  19  76  11  62  27
2  31  97  17  77  46  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 19 76 11 62 27]
 [31 97 17 77 46 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation per item-agent pair until all items are assigned. Here's a step-by-step process for allocation:

1. List all possible item-agent pairs with their valuations.
2. Sort these pairs in descending order based on valuation.
3. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
4. Continue this process until all items are assigned.

Now, let's perform the allocation:

| Agent | Item | Valuation |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 0     | 3    | 92        |
| 2     | 1    | 97        |
| 0     | 2    | 89        |
| 2     | 5    | 83        |
| 1     | 0    | 71        |
| 1     | 4    | 62        |

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation.

Now, let's convert this allocation to the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
