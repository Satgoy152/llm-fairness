Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  51  45   7  17  90
1  50  37  42  86  58  33
2  67  89  23  17  51  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 37 42 86 58 33]
 [67 89 23 17 51 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a roughly equal share of the total value. One common approach is using an algorithm for fair division, such as the max-sum allocation, which seeks to maximize the total value allocated to each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that is as fair as possible:

**Valuations table:**
```
       0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0:  4  51  45   7  17  90
Agent 1: 50  37  42  86  58  33
Agent 2: 67  89  23  17  51  45
```

**Steps to allocate:**
1. Identify the maximum value for each item to see which agent values it most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

**Item Valuations:**
- Item 0: Agent 2 values the most (67).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values the most (45).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values the most (86).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values the most (58).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values the most (90).

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Assign items based on the highest valuation while attempting to balance the number of items per agent.

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items 2 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 1

This allocation aims to provide a fair division based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

**JSON Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
