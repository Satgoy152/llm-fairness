Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  17  60  40  91  73
1  93  57   0  70  90  70
2  55  54   6  25  20  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [55 54  6 25 20 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, let's consider an approach that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will then balance the allocation so that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

First, let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [74, 17, 60, 40, 91, 73]
- Agent 1 values: [93, 57,  0, 70, 90, 70]
- Agent 2 values: [55, 54,  6, 25, 20, 26]

To allocate items, we can use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (93)
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (57)
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (60)
4. Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (70)
5. Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (91)
6. Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (73)

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 2: []

Since Agent 2 currently has no items, we can adjust the allocation:

Move Item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 2:

- Agent 0: [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [3]

This way, each agent receives at least one item. The allocations are now balanced while considering the agents' valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
