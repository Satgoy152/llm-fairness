Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  46  74  99  78  34
1  13  58  89  25   5  24
2  70  57  39  41  77  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 57 39 41 77 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the available valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 78
  - Item 5: 34

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 5
  - Item 5: 24

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 39
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 77
  - Item 5: 41

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness and total value for each agent:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value (99).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value (89).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value (70).

Now, considering the remaining items (1, 4, 5):

4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it has the second-highest value for Agent 2 (77).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the second-highest value for Agent 1 (58).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has a higher value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1 (34 vs 24).

This allocation maximizes the value each agent can get given the constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
