Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  93  26  75  26  83
1  85  72  20  28  59  63
2   1  93  42  14  86   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one effective approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items in a way that considers their valuations. A common method for achieving this is to use a variant of the "maximum marginal utility" approach. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Calculate Maximum Valuation for Each Item**: Identify which agent values each item the most, and assign the item to that agent if possible.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item**: Given the constraint that each agent should get an integer number of items, and there are only 6 items for 3 agents, we can ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 27     | 93     | 26     | 75     | 26     | 83     |
| 1     | 85     | 72     | 20     | 28     | 59     | 63     |
| 2     | 1      | 93     | 42     | 14     | 86     | 8      |

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 1 (85)
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agents 0 and 2 (93)
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 2 (42)
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (75)
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 2 (86)
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 0 (83)

Fair Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items based on these valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
- Resolve any conflicts (e.g., Item 1) by considering the overall distribution and alternate valuations.

Here's an allocation plan:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3, 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
