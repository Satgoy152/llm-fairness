Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  58  22  32  86  77
1  14  12  80  10  41  88
2  34  87  20  41   7  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 87 20 41  7 72]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy to optimize the total value each agent receives by considering their individual valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Analyze the valuations for each item and assign the highest valued items to the respective agents.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 and 5.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation (86) among all agents.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation (80).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation (87) among all agents.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it also has a high valuation (88) and ensures Agent 1 gets two items.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a higher valuation (65) than Agent 1 or 2.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it balances the allocation and provides a reasonable valuation (41).

After allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
