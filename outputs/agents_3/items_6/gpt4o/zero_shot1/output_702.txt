Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  98  18  16  26  52
1  80  70  77  80  29  14
2   3  15   3  92  96  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 70 77 80 29 14]
 [ 3 15  3 92 96 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value that each agent receives. Let's consider the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  98  18  16  26  52
1  80  70  77  80  29  14
2   3  15   3  92  96  21
```

A possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible. Here's how that could look:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (98).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (77).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (92).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (96).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (52).

Given these preferences, we need to check if we can balance allocations so that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, while also being aligned with their preferences as much as possible. Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the agents.
