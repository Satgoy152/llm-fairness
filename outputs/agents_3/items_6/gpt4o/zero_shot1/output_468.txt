Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  47  83  10  30  76
1  66  62   1  85   5  79
2  42  22  30  52  11  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated.

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation for each unallocated item. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 83.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 85.
3. Agent 0 values item 0 second most at 80.
4. Agent 1 values item 5 second most at 79.
5. Agent 0 values item 5 third most at 76 (but it's already allocated).
6. Agent 1 values item 0 third most at 66 (but it's already allocated).
7. Agent 2 values item 3 third most at 52 (but it's already allocated).
8. Agent 0 values item 1 fourth most at 47.
9. Agent 2 values item 0 fourth most at 42 (but it's already allocated).
10. Agent 1 values item 1 fourth most at 62 (but it's already allocated).
11. Agent 2 values item 2 fifth most at 30 (but it's already allocated).
12. Agent 1 values item 4 fifth most at 5.
13. Agent 2 values item 2 fifth most at 30 (but it's already allocated).
14. Agent 2 values item 5 at 30 (but it's already allocated).

Given the above allocations, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 5, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
