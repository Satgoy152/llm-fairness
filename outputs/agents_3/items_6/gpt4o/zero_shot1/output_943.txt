Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14   0  85  99  74  58
1  39  30  31  84   6  71
2  42  31  48   4   6  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2.

Now, we allocate the remaining items by considering the second highest values:

1. **Agent 0** can take item 4, where it has a high valuation compared to the others.
2. **Agent 1** can take item 0, as it values it more than agent 2.
3. **Agent 2** can take item 1, given its valuation is close to agent 0's, but agent 0 has already received two valuable items.

Here is a fair allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation attempts to maximize the agents' valuations for the items they receive.
