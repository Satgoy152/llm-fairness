Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  81  42  61  18  42
1  21  66  67  91  77  31
2  23  39   7  86  89  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 39  7 86 89 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, since we have three agents and six items. Here's one approach to achieve that:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is on item 1 (81).
   - Next significant valuation is on item 0 (77).
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is on item 3 (91).
   - Next significant valuation is on item 4 (77).
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is on item 4 (89), but since item 4 is allocated to Agent 1, we choose the next best.
   - The next highest valuation is on item 3 (86), which is also taken, so we select items 5 (32) and 2 (7) for Agent 2.
   - Allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items and maximizes the total perceived value for each agent based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences.
