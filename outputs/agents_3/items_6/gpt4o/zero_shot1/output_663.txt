Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57   6  12  73  26  81
1  81   7  61   4  35  85
2  49  34  27  84  42  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81  7 61  4 35 85]
 [49 34 27 84 42 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the total value as evenly as possible, taking into account each agent's valuation. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest remaining value for each agent until all items are allocated. Additionally, we'll consider each agent's need to have an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [57, 6, 12, 73, 26, 81]
- Agent 1 values: [81, 7, 61, 4, 35, 85]
- Agent 2 values: [49, 34, 27, 84, 42, 63]

We'll allocate items by checking which agent values an unallocated item the most, and assign it to them, while ensuring each agent gets two items since there are in total six items and three agents.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 1 (0):**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 81. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 5 (85):**
   - Agent 1 also values item 5 the highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 3 (84):**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 0 (57):**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest among remaining unallocated items. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4 (42):**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest among remaining unallocated items. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 2 (12):**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest among remaining unallocated items. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and the distribution is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
