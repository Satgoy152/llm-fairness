Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  62  70  74  44  97
1  49   3  25  90  20   3
2  11  68  57  66  11  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while all 6 items are allocated. A common approach to this problem is to use a method that maximizes the total utility based on the agents' valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive if they were assigned certain items.
2. Try to maximize the fairness by ensuring that each agent's allocation gives them a good value relative to the valuations of others.

Based on the given table, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

This allocation is based on balancing the overall values each agent receives from their items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and maximizing the preference of each agent for the items they receive.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This ensures all agents have items, respects the integer allocation constraint, and tries to balance the total utility each agent receives.
