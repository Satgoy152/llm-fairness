Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  80  84  22  64  18
1  13  34  72  49  62   4
2  95   4   2  72  37  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 69, agent 1 at 13, and agent 2 at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 80, agent 1 at 34, and agent 2 at 4.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 84, agent 1 at 72, and agent 2 at 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 22, agent 1 at 49, and agent 2 at 72.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 64, agent 1 at 62, and agent 2 at 37.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 18, agent 1 at 4, and agent 2 at 87.

A sensible way to allocate the items is to give each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Allocations based on maximum valuation:

- Item 0 goes to agent 2 (valuation: 95).
- Item 1 goes to agent 0 (valuation: 80).
- Item 2 goes to agent 0 (valuation: 84).
- Item 3 goes to agent 2 (valuation: 72).
- Item 4 goes to agent 0 (valuation: 64).
- Item 5 goes to agent 2 (valuation: 87).

Now, ensure each agent receives at least one item. In this allocation, agent 1 receives no items. To address this, we can consider reallocating one item (e.g., item 4) from agent 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 values item 4 second highest after agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 3, and 5.

Total items allocated: 6 (2 + 1 + 3 = 6).

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
