Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  69  97   2  65  63
1  84  49   9  75  45  69
2  45  52  36  45  12   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 49  9 75 45 69]
 [45 52 36 45 12  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences and valuations of each agent for the given items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  69  97   2  65  63
1  84  49   9  75  45  69
2  45  52  36  45  12   4
```

We can proceed to allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 0 and 2. We allocate these items to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3. We allocate this item to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1. We allocate this item to agent 2.
4. For items 4 and 5, we consider the remaining agents' preferences:
   - Agent 0 has the second-highest preference for item 4 (65) and item 5 (63).
   - Agent 1 has higher valuations for item 5 (69) than agent 0, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.

Now let's allocate item 4. Agent 0 has the highest remaining preference for item 4. We allocate item 4 to agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition of allocating exactly 6 items, and each agent receives items according to their preferences as fairly as possible.
