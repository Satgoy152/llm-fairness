Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  78  80  37  86  40
1  92  43  38  27  50  48
2  80  56  19  88  30  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should attempt to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This can be done by evaluating each agent's valuations and distributing the items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent. Let's analyze this step by step:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3.

A possible allocation could be:

- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 0 because they have high valuations for these items.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it has the highest valuation among all agents for this item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 as it has the highest valuation for this item.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (4 and 5):

- Item 4 can be given to Agent 0, as it has a relatively high valuation for it.
- Item 5 can be given to Agent 1, balancing the number of items each agent receives.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution aims to maximize the agents' total valuations based on the given table.
