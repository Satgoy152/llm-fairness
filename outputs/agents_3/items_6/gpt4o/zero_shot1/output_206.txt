Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  73  88  17  30   3
1  68  59  95  97   5  55
2  70  56  56  51  36  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (value) of all agents is maximized.

Let's try to find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (94), 2 (88), and 1 (73).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 3 (97), 2 (95), and 0 (68).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (78), 0 (70), and 1 (56).

We should avoid assigning the same item to multiple agents and ensure all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 97), since it's the highest single valuation.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 95), as this is another high valuation for them.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 94), as it's their highest valuation.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 73), as it's their second-highest valuation.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (value 78), as it's their highest valuation.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 or Agent 2. Since neither has a strong preference, we can choose Agent 2 to balance the distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the higher valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring all items are allocated fairly.
