Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  73  93  23  17  65
1  84  97  33  53  84  52
2  44  44  65  95  62  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We are trying to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuation Per Item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This will ensure that each item is utilized to its maximum potential value.

2. **Check for Fair Distribution**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item. If any agent does not have an item, perform swaps to ensure fairness.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (84).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (97).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (95).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (84).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (65).

4. **Ensuring Fairness**: Review the allocation to make sure each agent has at least one item and adjust if necessary:
   - Initially, Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4.
   - Agent 2 receives item 3.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item, optimizing for their valuations.
