Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45   0  75  39   9   3
1  73  75  74  78  85  91
2  82  48  53  13  16  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One possible method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate the allocations step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 values it at 78
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 85
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 91
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item.

- Agent 0 currently has item 2, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 has items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 has items 0 and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
