Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  19   2   5  81  50
1  13  97  56  37  37  72
2  53   7  44  65  22  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53  7 44 65 22 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: We observe that Agent 0 values item 0 very highly at 93. Additionally, item 4 is valued at 81, which is also high. Assigning items 0 and 4 to Agent 0 gives them a significant total value.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 at 97. Assigning item 1 to Agent 1 gives them a strong value. Agent 1 also values item 5 at 72, which is beneficial. Thus, items 1 and 5 can be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 at 65, which is the highest for this agent. Assigning item 3 to Agent 2 is advantageous. Agent 2 also has a moderate valuation for item 2 at 44, which can be allocated to Agent 2.

With this allocation, each agent receives two items, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
