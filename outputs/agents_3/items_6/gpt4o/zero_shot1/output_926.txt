Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  24  86  32   2  15
1  39   5  81  97   6  78
2  41  47  15  19  36  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, considering each agent should receive at least one item and the distribution should be as even as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 2 (value 86) to Agent 0, as it holds the highest value for them.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 3 (value 97) to Agent 1, as it holds the highest value for them.
   - Assign item 0 (value 39) to Agent 1, as it’s the next highest value item for them.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 5 (value 98) to Agent 2, as it holds the highest value for them.
   - Assign item 1 (value 47) to Agent 2, as it's the next highest value item for them.
   - Assign item 4 (value 36) to Agent 2, as it’s the next highest value item for them.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and each agent receives a number of items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
