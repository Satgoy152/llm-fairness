Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  68  72  62  70  49
1  35  98   9  10  48  65
2  62  15  72   8  25  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 15 72  8 25 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent first**, to ensure that every agent receives at least one item.
2. **Continue allocating items based on the highest remaining valuations**, ensuring that no agent receives more items than others until all items are allocated.

Let's implement this strategy:

- Agent 0: Highest value items are 2 (72), 4 (70), 1 (68)
- Agent 1: Highest value items are 1 (98), 5 (65), 0 (35)
- Agent 2: Highest value items are 2 (72), 0 (62), 5 (30)

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 2 (highest valued item for Agent 0).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 1 (highest valued item for Agent 1).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 0 (highest valued item for Agent 2).

Now, remaining items: [3, 4, 5]

4. **Agent 0** gets item 4 (next highest valued item for Agent 0).
5. **Agent 1** gets item 5 (next highest valued item for Agent 1).
6. **Agent 2** gets item 3 (next highest valued item for Agent 2).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
