Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  84  12  64  35  46
1  81  41  39  51  75  99
2   2   7   6  51  60  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 0, 1, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 0, 4, and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 5 and 4.

Given these observations, we can try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 3. This agent has high valuations for these items.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 4 and 5. This agent places high value on these items, especially item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1 and 2. While these aren't the highest valued for Agent 2, it balances the distribution and ensures each agent receives items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to distribute the highest valued items proportionately. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
