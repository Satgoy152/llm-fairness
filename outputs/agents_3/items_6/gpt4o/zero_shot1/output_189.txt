Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  86  96  98  23  20
1  10  59  81  51  33  44
2  59  31  70  11  98  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing the total value that each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items 2 and 3 have the highest valuations for Agent 0. Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - The next highest valuations are for items 1 and 5 for Agent 1. Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The remaining items are 0 and 4. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4. Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
