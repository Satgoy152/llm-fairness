Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  69  40  61  91  97
1   1  97  37  93  63  35
2  32  92  36  38  93  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to assign items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll approach the allocation by considering the highest values each agent has for the items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations for a balanced allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97), Item 4 (91), Item 3 (61)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 3 (93), Item 4 (63)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuations: Item 4 (93), Item 1 (92), Item 5 (87)

Considering these high valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0, since they have the highest valuation for this item.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, since they have the highest valuation for this item.
3. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, since they have the highest valuation for this item.
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest value for them.
5. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest value for them.
6. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as it is a remaining item.

This allocation considers an equitable distribution based on each agent's preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
