Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  56   3  25  17  15
1  50   9  39  80  19  19
2  84  26  94  30  72  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 26 94 30 72 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, given that there are three agents and six items. Here is one way to distribute the items based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 0 is 78 for item 0.
   - The second-highest valuation is 56 for item 1.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 1 is 80 for item 3.
   - The second-highest valuation is 50 for item 0, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The highest valuation for Agent 2 is 94 for item 2.
   - The second-highest valuation is 84 for item 0, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0.

Using the above strategy, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest available).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest available).

Let's put the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is six, which satisfies the requirements.
