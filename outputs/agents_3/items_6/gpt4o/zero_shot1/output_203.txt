Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  28  26  47  66  60
1   4  94  72  99  35  79
2  67  90  42  77  62  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent as evenly as possible. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items they value relatively high compared to other agents.
- Agent 1: Allocate items that have the highest values for them.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that maximize their total value while considering the allocations for the other agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (52), 3 (47), 4 (66), 5 (60) the most.
- Agent 1 values items: 1 (94), 2 (72), 3 (99), 5 (79) the most.
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (67), 1 (90), 3 (77), 4 (62) the most.

Based on this analysis, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the items are distributed based on their valuations to maximize individual satisfaction where possible.
