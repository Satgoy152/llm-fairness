Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  22  91  92  72  62
1  57  82  14  88  95  98
2  31  63  61  65  99  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 82 14 88 95 98]
 [31 63 61 65 99 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (as there are 3 agents and 6 items). Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate total valuations for each item across all agents and allocate them to the agents who value them the most.

2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [47, 22, 91, 92, 72, 62]
- Agent 1: [57, 82, 14, 88, 95, 98]
- Agent 2: [31, 63, 61, 65, 99, 85]

Here’s a possible allocation based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 92.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 98.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 99.

Now, let's assign additional items:

- After assigning item 3 to Agent 0, the next highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 at 91.
- After assigning item 5 to Agent 1, the next highest value for Agent 1 is item 4, but it’s already taken, so we consider item 1 at 82.
- After assigning item 4 to Agent 2, the next highest value for Agent 2 is item 5, but it’s already taken, so we consider item 3, but it’s already taken, so item 1 at 63 is next.

Finally, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Can take item 0 (47) since 1 and 2 are already taken.
- Agent 1: Can take item 1 (82) since 5 is already taken.
- Agent 2: Can take item 2 (61) since 4 and 5 are already taken.

Here’s the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, maximizing their individual preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
