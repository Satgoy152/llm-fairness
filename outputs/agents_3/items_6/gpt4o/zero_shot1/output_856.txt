Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  88  86  44  79  76
1  68  35  79  26  35   8
2  34  55  40  19  88  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 35 79 26 35  8]
 [34 55 40 19 88 51]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: Valuation of 88
   - Item 2: Valuation of 86

   Total valuation for Agent 0 = 88 + 86 = 174

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: Valuation of 68
   - Item 4: Valuation of 35
   - Item 5: Valuation of 8

   Total valuation for Agent 1 = 68 + 35 + 8 = 111

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3: Valuation of 19

   Total valuation for Agent 2 = 19

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated. The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
