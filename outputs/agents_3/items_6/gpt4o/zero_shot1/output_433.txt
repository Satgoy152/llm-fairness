Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  99  99  99  20  32
1  75  58  93   9  32  75
2  98  48   3  68  25  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations first:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 20
  - Item 5: 32

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 9
  - Item 4: 32
  - Item 5: 75

- Agent 2 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 68
  - Item 4: 25
  - Item 5: 12

To fairly allocate the items, we will try to give each agent one of the items they value highly while considering others' valuations to avoid conflicts and ensure fairness. 

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 has the highest valuation for it (98).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has a high valuation for it (99).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it highly (93).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (99).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 because it is one of the remaining items with a moderate value for Agent 2 (25).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most after considering other allocations (75).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes individual satisfactions based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
