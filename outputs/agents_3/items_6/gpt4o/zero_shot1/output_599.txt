Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  69  87  79  97  21
1  17  34  51  10  19  85
2  89   4  12  51  43  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring an integer distribution of items. Let's consider the valuations for each agent and distribute items to maximize their preferences:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 87
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 97
- Item 5: 21

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 34
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 10
- Item 4: 19
- Item 5: 85

**Agent 2's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 4
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 43
- Item 5: 54

By analyzing the table, we can assign items based on maximizing total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0:** Valuation = 97 (highest available)
2. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 1:** Valuation = 85 (highest available)
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2:** Valuation = 89 (highest available)

Remaining items: 1, 2, 3

4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:** Valuation = 87 (second highest)
5. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2:** Valuation = 51 (second highest for Agent 2)

Remaining item: 1

6. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:** Valuation = 69

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 6.
