Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  48  47   7  83  93
1  40  24  48  31  42  98
2   6  97  69  24  30  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 24 48 31 42 98]
 [ 6 97 69 24 30 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly at 93.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 31 and item 4 at 42.
- Agent 2 values item 1 very highly at 97 and item 2 at 69.

Let's assign based on maximizing each agent's values:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 because it has the highest value for that agent.
2. Assign item 3 and item 4 to agent 1 because they collectively have a good value for that agent.
3. Assign item 1 and item 2 to agent 2 because they have high values for that agent.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the next highest value for it.

This ensures all items are allocated and the agents' total values are maximized fairly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
