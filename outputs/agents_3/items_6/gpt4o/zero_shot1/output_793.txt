Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  30  91  74  68  85
1  35  34  96  98  87  11
2  74  31  48   2  10  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

We can use a simple approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. In case of a tie, arbitrarily assign the item to one of the agents with the highest valuation.

Let's evaluate the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 35, Agent 2 at 74. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 at 34, Agent 2 at 31. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 96, Agent 2 at 48. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 98, Agent 2 at 2. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 87, Agent 2 at 10. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 11, Agent 2 at 83. Assign to Agent 0.

Following this allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives no items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```
