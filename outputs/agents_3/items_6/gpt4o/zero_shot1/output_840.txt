Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68   0  14   6  31  65
1  84  36  67  95  40  31
2  88  35  35  28  61  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 35 35 28 61 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items with the highest value for them. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 has the highest valuation of 88.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the highest valuation of 36.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the highest valuation of 67.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the highest valuation of 95.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2, as agent 2 has the highest valuation of 61.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 has the highest valuation of 98.

This allocation provides each agent with items where they have relatively higher valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
