Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  40  74  56  36  86
1  41  92  81  95  70  10
2  57  82  21  88  92  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 92 81 95 70 10]
 [57 82 21 88 92 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 5: Value 86
   - Item 2: Value 74

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 95
   - Item 1: Value 92

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4: Value 92
   - Item 0: Value 57

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total valuation for each agent is reasonably high.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
