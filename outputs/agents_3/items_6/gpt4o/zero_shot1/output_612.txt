Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  62  63  37  58  95
1  26  81  71  15  65  59
2  19  30  90  19  85  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 81 71 15 65 59]
 [19 30 90 19 85 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start with agent 2, who values item 2 at 90, which is the highest valuation for any item, and assign it to them.
2. Next, assign agent 0 item 5, which they value at 95, the second highest single valuation.
3. Assign agent 1 item 1, which they value at 81, to satisfy their highest preference.
4. Assign agent 2 item 4, which is their next highest valued item at 85.
5. Assign agent 0 item 0, for which they have the highest valuation among the remaining items.
6. Lastly, assign agent 1 item 3, which they value at 15, as it is the remaining item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
