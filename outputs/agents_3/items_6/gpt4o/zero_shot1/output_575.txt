Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  69   1  43  17  21
1  48  37  76   1  34  65
2  65  78  19  52  95  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize overall satisfaction or fairness among the agents. One common approach is to use an optimization method or heuristic that ensures each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation that seeks to distribute the items fairly among the agents:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that Agent 0 values relatively highly.
- Agent 1: Allocate items that Agent 1 values relatively highly.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that Agent 2 values relatively highly.

Let's go through the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 52
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17
   - Agent 1 values it at 34
   - Agent 2 values it at 95
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21
   - Agent 1 values it at 65
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

However, to ensure fairness, we should balance the allocations. Let's reallocate so that each agent receives at least one item:

Adjusting allocations for fairness:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value)
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest value)
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value)
4. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (second-highest value)
5. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest value)
6. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, aligning the distribution more evenly while considering their valuations.
