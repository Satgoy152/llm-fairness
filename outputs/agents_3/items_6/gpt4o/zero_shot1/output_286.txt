Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  98  52  16  28  64
1  94  22  40  93  68  15
2  82  30  21  99   8  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 22 40 93 68 15]
 [82 30 21 99  8 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their individual preferences. Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

### Step 1: List each agent's preferred items
- **Agent 0:** Highest to lowest valuation: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (59), Item 5 (64), Item 2 (52), Item 4 (28), Item 3 (16)
- **Agent 1:** Highest to lowest valuation: Item 0 (94), Item 3 (93), Item 4 (68), Item 2 (40), Item 1 (22), Item 5 (15)
- **Agent 2:** Highest to lowest valuation: Item 3 (99), Item 0 (82), Item 5 (35), Item 1 (30), Item 2 (21), Item 4 (8)

### Step 2: Allocate items to agents based on their preferences, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible

1. **Agent 0** gets Item 1 (value 98) and Item 5 (value 64)
2. **Agent 1** gets Item 0 (value 94) and Item 3 (value 93)
3. **Agent 2** gets Item 2 (value 21) and Item 4 (value 8)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a high total valuation based on their preferences while distributing all items.

### Allocations in JSON format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of items based on their preferences, ensuring a balanced and fair distribution.
