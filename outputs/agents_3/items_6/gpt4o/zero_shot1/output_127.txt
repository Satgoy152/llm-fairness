Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  99  91  11   3  13
1  10  92  97   7   4  36
2  79  94  13  17  36  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 92 97  7  4 36]
 [79 94 13 17 36 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Item 1 (99), Item 2 (91).
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item available for Agent 1: Item 5 (36).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: Item 0 (79), Item 4 (36).
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: Item 3.
   - Highest valuation for Item 3 is by Agent 2 (17).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, all items have been distributed among the agents. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
