Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  76  77  24  91  67
1  89  29  51  34  33  16
2  47  52   2  85  44  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the total value received by each agent. There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but a simple method is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is fair.

Let's evaluate the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 4 the highest with 91
  - Next highest is Item 2 with 77
  - Followed by Item 1 with 76

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 the highest with 89
  - Next highest is Item 2 with 51 
  - Followed by Item 1 with 29

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 3 the highest with 85
  - Next highest is Item 1 with 52
  - Followed by Item 4 with 44

Let's start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 since it's their highest value.
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since it's their highest value.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 since it's their highest value.

Now we have allocated 3 items, and each agent has at least one item. Let's allocate the remaining items:

4. Consider Item 2, which Agent 0 values highly (77). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
5. Consider Item 1, which Agent 2 values higher than Agent 0 and Agent 1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
6. Finally, Item 5 can be allocated to the agent with the least total value so far, which is Agent 1. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has been allocated items as follows:

- Agent 0: [4, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 1]

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on each agent's highest valued items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
