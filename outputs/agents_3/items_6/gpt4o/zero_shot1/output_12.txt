Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  82  92  38  70  19
1   4   5  74  58   8  50
2  60  34  36  43  78  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we want to maximize the efficiency of the allocation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can approach this by giving each agent the items they value the most.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**'s valuations: [48, 82, 92, 38, 70, 19]
   - Highest-valued items for Agent 0: Item 2 (92), Item 1 (82), Item 4 (70)

2. **Agent 1**'s valuations: [4, 5, 74, 58, 8, 50]
   - Highest-valued items for Agent 1: Item 2 (74), Item 3 (58), Item 5 (50)

3. **Agent 2**'s valuations: [60, 34, 36, 43, 78, 48]
   - Highest-valued items for Agent 2: Item 4 (78), Item 0 (60), Item 3 (43)

To ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets items they value highly, let's make a preliminary allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 1] (values 92, 82)
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 5] (values 58, 50)
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 0] (values 78, 60)

This allocation gives each agent two items and makes use of all 6 items, distributing them in a way that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
