Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  82  94  63  11  91
1   2  65  75  78  74  21
2  19   2  81  26  25  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 65 75 78 74 21]
 [19  2 81 26 25 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are distributed.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [84, 82, 94, 63, 11, 91]
- Agent 1: [2, 65, 75, 78, 74, 21]
- Agent 2: [19, 2, 81, 26, 25, 51]

We'll allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction considering the constraints.

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item to ensure they get a fair share.
2. Allocate remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 2 (94), assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 3 (78), assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 2 (81), but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 5 (51), assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, we'll allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 4):

4. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is item 0 (84), assign item 0 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is item 1 (65), assign item 1 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2**: Last remaining item is item 4 (25), assign item 4 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

All items are allocated, and each agent has received items based on their preferences as best as possible given the constraints.
