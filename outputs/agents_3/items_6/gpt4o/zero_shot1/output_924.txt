Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  39  58  29  62  59
1  93  93  92  29   4  99
2  56  33  61  49  57  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

One common approach to achieve fairness is to use the "maximum total valuation" method, meaning each agent gets the items they value the most, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there is a tie in valuation, assign the item to the agent with fewer items (if possible) to balance the allocation.

Here is how the allocation might look:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 1 also values it the most at 93.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 49.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 62.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.

Now, let's check if the distribution can be made more balanced:

Agent 1 has many high-valued items, so we need to ensure a more balanced allocation:

- Give item 0 to agent 1.
- Give item 1 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it second most after agent 1.
- Give item 2 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it second most after agent 1.
- Give item 3 to agent 2.
- Give item 4 to agent 0.
- Give item 5 to agent 1.

This results in a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent ends up with an integer number of items and attempts to maximize total valuation while keeping the distribution fair.
