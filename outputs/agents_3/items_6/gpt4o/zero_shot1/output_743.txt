Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  45  68  65  79  83
1  67  99  35   8  19  71
2  29  49  63  56   6  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can focus on maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. This is a classic problem in fair division and combinatorial optimization.

Let's look at each agent's highest values and then allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:** Values items 5 (83), 4 (79), 2 (68), 3 (65), 1 (45), and 0 (17) in descending order. 
2. **Agent 1:** Values items 1 (99), 0 (67), 5 (71), 2 (35), 4 (19), and 3 (8).
3. **Agent 2:** Values items 2 (63), 3 (56), 1 (49), 5 (59), 0 (29), and 4 (6).

Let's try to assign items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value 99).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value 83).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value 63).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest value 79).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value 67).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (second highest value 56).

With this approach, each agent receives two items, and the overall valuation is maximized as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
