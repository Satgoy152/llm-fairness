Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  81  73  28  14  36
1  51  72  53  50  11  54
2  14  60   8  79  26  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent first if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Balance the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values: [3, 81, 73, 28, 14, 36]
- Agent 1 values: [51, 72, 53, 50, 11, 54]
- Agent 2 values: [14, 60, 8, 79, 26, 41]

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest-valued item: Item 1 (value 81)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest-valued item: Item 1 (value 72), but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest-valued item: Item 5 (value 54)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest-valued item: Item 3 (value 79)

Now, each agent has one item. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

4. For Agent 0, the next highest-valued item is 2 (value 73).
5. For Agent 1, the next highest-valued item is 2 (value 53), but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next option: Item 0 (value 51)
6. For Agent 2, the next highest-valued item is 5 (value 41), but it's already taken by Agent 1.
   - Next option: Item 4 (value 26)
   
Reevaluate the remaining items:

7. Item 3 is already assigned to Agent 2.
8. For Agent 0, the next highest-valued item is 5, but it's already taken.
   - Next option: Item 0 (value 3), but it's already taken.
   - Next option: Item 4 (value 14), but it's already taken.

After balancing based on availability and preference, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items while maximizing their preferences as much as possible.
