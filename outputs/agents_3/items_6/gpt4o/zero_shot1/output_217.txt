Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  88  67  30  95  73
1   1   8  29  11  94  38
2  29  22  70   0  86  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 22 70  0 86 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:
   - Agent 0: 2 + 88 + 67 + 30 + 95 + 73 = 355
   - Agent 1: 1 + 8 + 29 + 11 + 94 + 38 = 181
   - Agent 2: 29 + 22 + 70 + 0 + 86 + 20 = 227

2. Analyze the values to determine which items are most valuable to each agent. Distribute items to maximize total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest total valuation and a high value for items 1 and 4 (88 and 95, respectively).
- Agent 1 has less overall value but places high value on item 4 (94).
- Agent 2 places high value on items 2 and 4 (70 and 86).

Based on these considerations, here's a fair allocation:

- Assign item 1 and 5 to Agent 0 (88, 73)
- Assign item 3 and 4 to Agent 1 (11, 94)
- Assign item 0 and 2 to Agent 2 (29, 70)

This allocation is fair as it gives each agent a considerable value from the items they are assigned. The items are distributed such that agents get items they value highly.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
