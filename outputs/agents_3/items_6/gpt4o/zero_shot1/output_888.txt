Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  16  31  34  16  62
1   6  59  27  20  49  10
2  60  20  48  14  18  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 59 27 20 49 10]
 [60 20 48 14 18 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most, so we assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, but it's already assigned to agent 0. The next highest value for agent 2 is item 0, so we assign item 0 to agent 2.

Now, we have assigned 3 items and 3 more items need to be allocated. Next, we consider the remaining items and distribute them while attempting to keep the allocation fair:

- Item 2 has not been allocated yet. Agent 0 values it the most after their highest valued item, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Item 3 has not been allocated yet. Agent 0 values it the most after their highest valued item, so assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Item 4 has not been allocated yet. Agent 1 values item 4 the most after item 1, so assign item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
