Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  60  46  35  60  33
1  57   8   8  47  25  80
2  53  72  50  92  47  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One possible way to approach this is to consider the highest valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent who values it the most. We can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 1 values it at 57 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 53

   Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 60
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 72 (highest)

   Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 46
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 50 (highest)

   Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 47 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 92

   Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 60 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 25
   - Agent 2 values it at 47

   Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 33
   - Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 67

   Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
