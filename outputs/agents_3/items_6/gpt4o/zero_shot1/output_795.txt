Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  35   7   6  53  67
1  80  84  98  79  28  70
2  70  84  17  87   1  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We'll consider different combinations to find a fair distribution.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

Agent 0's Valuations:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 6
- Item 4: 53
- Item 5: 67

Agent 1's Valuations:
- Item 0: 80
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 98
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 28
- Item 5: 70

Agent 2's Valuations:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 17
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 1
- Item 5: 99

To distribute items fairly, let's consider optimal allocations where total valuations are maximized for each agent:

- Agent 0 could be allocated items 0 and 4, with valuations of 49 and 53, respectively.
- Agent 1 could be allocated items 2 and 3, with valuations of 98 and 79, respectively.
- Agent 2 could be allocated items 1 and 5, with valuations of 84 and 99, respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the total valuation is fairly distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
