Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55   7  51  32  30   3
1  22  98  17  99  77  77
2  67  53  38  81  66  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55  7 51 32 30  3]
 [22 98 17 99 77 77]
 [67 53 38 81 66 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one way to do it:

1. Check the highest valuation for each item across all agents and allocate the item to the agent with the highest value for that item.

Here's the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest value of 67.
- Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest value of 98.
- Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest value of 51.
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest value of 99.
- Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest value of 77.
- Item 5: Agent 1 and Agent 2 both have a value of 32, but Agent 1 already has many items, so assign it to Agent 2 for fairness.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also distributing the items fairly among the agents.
