Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  48  57  66  93  16
1  83  31  19  57  70   2
2  77  47  69  76  87  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 48 57 66 93 16]
 [83 31 19 57 70  2]
 [77 47 69 76 87 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will employ a simple heuristic approach to achieve this.

First, we analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: [92, 48, 57, 66, 93, 16]
Agent 1: [83, 31, 19, 57, 70,  2]
Agent 2: [77, 47, 69, 76, 87, 12]
```

We will assign items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on an item. To ensure fairness, we will try to distribute items evenly across agents if possible.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4, 0, and 3.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0, 4, and 3.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (since item 4 is taken).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4, 3, and 2.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (since item 4 is taken).

Now we continue to allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest remaining valuations for items 2, 1, 5.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest remaining valuations for items 4, 3, 2.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest remaining valuations for items 2, 1, 5.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

This ensures that each agent gets an item with a reasonably high value for them, and all agents receive at least one item.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
