Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  76  90  87  25  38
1  22  62  44  87  83  82
2  83  82  15  74  31  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 82 15 74 31 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value of items. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the total value each agent receives while distributing the items evenly.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 29 + 76 + 90 + 87 + 25 + 38 = 345
- Agent 1: 22 + 62 + 44 + 87 + 83 + 82 = 380
- Agent 2: 83 + 82 + 15 + 74 + 31 + 19 = 304

Next, we can allocate the items to try to balance the value each agent receives. A simple way to start is to assign items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, ensuring each item is only assigned once and each agent gets a fair number of items.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2 (value 90 for Agent 0)
   - Item 0 (value 29 for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 (value 87 for Agent 1)
   - Item 4 (value 83 for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1 (value 82 for Agent 2)
   - Item 5 (value 19 for Agent 2)

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable total value from their allocated items, while also ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
