Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  53  14  81  39  99
1  49  14  60  76  43  73
2  88  62  11  23  66  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 53 14 81 39 99]
 [49 14 60 76 43 73]
 [88 62 11 23 66 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and no agent receives more than two items. This will help in distributing the items more evenly.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [32, 53, 14, 81, 39, 99]
- Agent 1: [49, 14, 60, 76, 43, 73]
- Agent 2: [88, 62, 11, 23, 66, 83]

One way to allocate fairly is to give each agent one of their highest valued items, and then distribute the remaining items to balance out total valuations.

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 99).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 88).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 76).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 62) since Agent 2 values it second highest.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 43) to give them more value.
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 14) to balance the number of items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.
