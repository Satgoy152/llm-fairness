Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  35  80  68  84  33
1  38  99  54  29  43  93
2  38   4  49  14  29  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given there are 6 items and 3 agents. A fair allocation could be determined by assigning items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are items 4 (84) and 2 (80).
   - Allocate items [4, 2] to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After allocating to Agent 0, the next highest value items for Agent 1 are items 1 (99) and 5 (93).
   - Allocate items [1, 5] to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items are 0 and 3.
   - Allocate items [0, 3] to Agent 2, as they have the highest remaining value for item 5 (92) but it is already allocated.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.
