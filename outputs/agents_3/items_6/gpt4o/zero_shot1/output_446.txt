Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  95  92  87  30  75
1  52  68  70  13  59  46
2  88  64  12  16  25  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:**

   - Agent 0: 45 + 95 + 92 + 87 + 30 + 75 = 424
   - Agent 1: 52 + 68 + 70 + 13 + 59 + 46 = 308
   - Agent 2: 88 + 64 + 12 + 16 + 25 + 15 = 220

2. **Sort each agent's item valuations in descending order to prioritize higher valued items:**

   - Agent 0: Items by valuation: [1, 2, 3, 5, 0, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items by valuation: [2, 1, 0, 4, 5, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items by valuation: [0, 1, 4, 5, 3, 2]

3. **Allocate items to each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once:**

   The goal is to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent reflects a fair distribution. We can start by assigning the highest valued item available to each agent and proceed accordingly.

   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value available for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value available for Agent 1)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest value available for Agent 2)

4. **Check if all items are allocated:**

   The items [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are all allocated.

5. **Present the final allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures a balanced distribution of items based on the given valuations, maximizing the satisfaction of each agent according to their preferences.
