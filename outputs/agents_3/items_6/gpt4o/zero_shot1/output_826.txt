Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  50  77  15   6  83
1  55  91  98  69  53  48
2  34  65  80  57  63  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 65 80 57 63 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to balance the distribution of value each agent receives. One common approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring a fair distribution of total value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent could achieve if they get the items with their highest valuation:

- Agent 0 values: [40, 50, 77, 15, 6, 83] → highest values are 83, 77, 50
- Agent 1 values: [55, 91, 98, 69, 53, 48] → highest values are 98, 91, 69
- Agent 2 values: [34, 65, 80, 57, 63, 41] → highest values are 80, 65, 63

Let's allocate the items such that each agent gets the maximum possible value, without any overlaps:

1. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 98)
2. Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 83)
3. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 91)
4. Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 63)
5. Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 57)
6. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 40)

Now, each agent received a fair allocation of items based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 5 and 0 (total value 83 + 40 = 123)
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 1 (total value 98 + 91 = 189)
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 3 (total value 63 + 57 = 120)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
