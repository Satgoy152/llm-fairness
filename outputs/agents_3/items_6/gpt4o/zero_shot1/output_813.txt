Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63   3  67  56  24  75
1   5   2  97  82   8  26
2  95  95  59  38  28  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 24.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.

2. **Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:**  
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

3. **Resulting allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 4 and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least two items, and the total allocation is balanced across all agents. The result is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
