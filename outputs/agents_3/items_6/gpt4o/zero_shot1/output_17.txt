Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  93  82   9  82  96
1  96  16   0  72  68  58
2  60  84  63  16  64  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 93 82  9 82 96]
 [96 16  0 72 68 58]
 [60 84 63 16 64 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will analyze the valuations and assign the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0, but since agent 0 also values item 0 highly and has more overall high valuations, we'll prioritize agent 0 for item 0. Agent 1's next highest valuations are for items 3 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5, which is not as highly valued by the other agents. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (as it is valued highly by both agents 0 and 1, but agent 0 has more overall high valuations).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for this item among the remaining items).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
