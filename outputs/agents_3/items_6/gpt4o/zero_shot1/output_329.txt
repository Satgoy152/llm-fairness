Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  44  40  12  42  23
1  53  14  22  47  89  81
2  34  82  56   2  40  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 82 56  2 40 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. This can be done using a simple greedy algorithm that considers each item's highest valuation first. Let's go through the process:

1. Look at each item and find which agent values it the most.
2. Allocate the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 99 (highest), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 82 (highest), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 56 (highest), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 47 (highest), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 89 (highest), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 81 (highest), so allocate to Agent 1.

Now let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
