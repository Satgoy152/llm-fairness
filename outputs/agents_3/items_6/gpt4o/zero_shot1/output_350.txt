Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  94  45  71  96  40
1  47  39   6  27  68  45
2  28  53  44  88  32  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 39  6 27 68 45]
 [28 53 44 88 32 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider both the valuations and the number of items each agent should receive. Each agent should ideally receive 2 items (since there are 3 agents and 6 items).

Let's consider the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 and 4. Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high valuations for items 4 and 5, but item 4 is already allocated. The next highest valuations are for items 0 and 5. Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent will receive the remaining items, which are 2 and 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
