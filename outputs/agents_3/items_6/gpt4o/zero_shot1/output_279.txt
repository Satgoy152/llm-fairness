Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  46  96  94  64  71
1  64  92   0  84  62  69
2  39  46  71  38  63  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 92  0 84 62 69]
 [39 46 71 38 63 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all six items are allocated. We can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 4: 64
  - Item 5: 71

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 84
  - Item 4: 62
  - Item 5: 69

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 63
  - Item 5: 29

To maximize the fairness, we can use a strategy where each agent gets the items for which they have the highest relative valuation compared to the other agents. Letâ€™s proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (64), so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (92), so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (96), so assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (94), so assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (63), so assign to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (71), but Agent 2 also values it (29), however, Agent 0 already has two high-value items compared to Agent 2's allocation, so assign to Agent 2.

Now, let's format the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items and the total number of items allocated is six.
