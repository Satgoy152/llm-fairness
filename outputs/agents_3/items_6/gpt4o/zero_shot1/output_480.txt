Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  80  90  62   6   7
1  58  34  65  49  83  96
2  10  31  43   5  70  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 80 90 62  6  7]
 [58 34 65 49 83 96]
 [10 31 43  5 70 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [6, 80, 90, 62, 6, 7]
- Agent 1: [58, 34, 65, 49, 83, 96]
- Agent 2: [10, 31, 43, 5, 70, 35]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 1 and 2, with values 80 and 90, respectively.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 5 and 4, with values 96 and 83, respectively.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5, but since it's already given to Agent 1, we will look for the next best allocation.
4. We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for it compared to others.
5. Item 3 will be allocated to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a high valuation for it.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: No items (since we only have 6 items and Agent 2 has the lowest valuations overall).

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing each agent's valuation where possible.
