Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  61  93   7  85  56
1  84   4  98  95  89  76
2  59  28  53  89  26  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be approached by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items, and ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are more items than agents.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Check if the items are distributed fairly and adjust if necessary.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest values are for items: 2 (93) and 4 (85).
- Agent 1's highest values are for items: 2 (98), 3 (95), and 4 (89).
- Agent 2's highest values are for items: 3 (89) and 5 (71).

Now, we can proceed with a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2 (93) to Agent 0, as Agent 1 and Agent 0 both highly value it, but it gives Agent 0 an item. Assign item 0 (68) to Agent 0 as well.
- Agent 1: Assign item 3 (95) to Agent 1. Also, assign item 1 (4) to Agent 1 to ensure they have more than one item.
- Agent 2: Assign item 5 (71) to Agent 2. Assign item 4 (26) to Agent 2 to ensure they have more than one item.

Now let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items [2, 0].
- Agent 1 has items [3, 1].
- Agent 2 has items [5, 4].

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
