Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  36  32  42  92  14
1  64  22  93  90  61   1
2  44  34  22  11  42  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. One approach is to use a method similar to the "Hungarian algorithm," which can help with optimal assignment problems. However, for simplicity, I'll proceed with a more intuitive approach by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items.

Let's evaluate the highest preferences:

1. Agent 0's highest valuations:
   - Item 4: 92
   - Item 3: 42
   - Item 1: 36

2. Agent 1's highest valuations:
   - Item 2: 93
   - Item 3: 90
   - Item 0: 64

3. Agent 2's highest valuations:
   - Item 5: 53
   - Item 0: 44
   - Item 1: 34

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest score of 93.
2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest score of 92.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the next highest score of 90.
4. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2, as it has the highest score of 53.
5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the next highest score of 64.
6. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the next highest score of 36.

Following this process, we have allocated all items fairly based on their valuations. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```
