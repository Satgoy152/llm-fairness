Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4   9  65  18  91  64
1   3  59  77  69  51  89
2  18  89  24  47  43  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 89 24 47 43 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring every agent gets at least one item. We will go through the process of assigning the items based on the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 4 (91), Item 2 (65).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value among all items for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (89), Item 2 (77), Item 3 (69).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value among all items for Agent 1.
  
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 1 (89), Item 3 (47).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 because it has the highest value among all items for Agent 2.

Now that each agent has at least one item, allocate remaining items based on maximizing overall satisfaction:

4. **Agent 0**: Already has Item 4, next highest valuable item is Item 2.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**: Already has Item 5, next highest valuable item is Item 3.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**: Already has Item 1, next highest valuable item is Item 0.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

The final allocation of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
