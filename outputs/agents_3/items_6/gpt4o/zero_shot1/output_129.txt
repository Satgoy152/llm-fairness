Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  78  68  44   5  20
1  40  52   2  96  90  90
2  95  42  33   8  35   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. This approach aims to give each agent the items they value most, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate those items first.
2. Continue allocating remaining items to agents, considering their next highest valuations and ensuring no item is allocated twice.

By following this method, we get:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (78), item 2 the next (68), and item 0 the next (38).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (96), item 4 the next (90), and item 5 the next (90).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (95), item 1 the next (42), and item 2 the next (33).

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is fair, we can distribute items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and all items are distributed. Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
