Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  63  96   6   9  39
1  87  59  90  51  92  54
2  74  89  31  75   2  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 89 31 75  2 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations. One approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm for optimizing assignment problems. However, since the problem is small, we can manually evaluate a reasonable allocation.

Here's a possible allocation considering the valuation table:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most and has moderate interest in items 0 and 3.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (valuation 87).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (valuation 89).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (valuation 96).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (valuation 75).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (valuation 92).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (valuation 39).

This allocation tries to respect the highest valuations for each item while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and the overall distribution is balanced based on the valuations provided.
