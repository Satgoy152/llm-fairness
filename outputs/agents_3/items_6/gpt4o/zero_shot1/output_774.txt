Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  69  63  18   6  13
1  96  25  61  48  31  68
2   6   9  95  90  38  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 25 61 48 31 68]
 [ 6  9 95 90 38 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's look at the valuations and make decisions to maximize fairness and total valuation:

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [35, 69, 63, 18, 6, 13]
- **Agent 1**: [96, 25, 61, 48, 31, 68]
- **Agent 2**: [6, 9, 95, 90, 38, 62]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 and also values item 5 highly.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 3.

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 2, as they have high valuations for these items.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 5, as they have high valuations for these items.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3 and 4, as they have reasonable valuations for these items.

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [1, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [3, 4]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items they value highly, attempting to balance fairness with maximizing individual valuations.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
