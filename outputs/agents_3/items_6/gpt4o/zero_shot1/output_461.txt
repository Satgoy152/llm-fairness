Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  92  19  20  36  46
1  70   4  19  92  11  86
2  88  38  82  12  59  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 38 82 12 59 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. First, let's identify the highest value for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most with 92.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most with 92.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most with 88.

2. Assign these highest-valued items to each agent:
   - Agent 0 gets item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 0.

3. Now, allocate the remaining items (2, 4, 5) to maximize fairness:
   - For item 2, the values are: Agent 0 (19), Agent 1 (19), Agent 2 (82). Assign to Agent 2.
   - For item 4, the values are: Agent 0 (36), Agent 1 (11), Agent 2 (59). Assign to Agent 2.
   - For item 5, the values are: Agent 0 (46), Agent 1 (86), Agent 2 (27). Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and maximizes the total valuation based on their preferences.
