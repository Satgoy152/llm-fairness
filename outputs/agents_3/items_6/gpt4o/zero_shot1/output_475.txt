Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  74  61  34  94  91
1  38  48  69  10  13  71
2  14  66  60  33  86  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 66 60 33 86 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. A common approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, as long as each agent ends up with exactly two items.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Items valued by each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (94), Item 5 (91)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (69), Item 5 (71)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (86), Item 1 (66)

2. **Assign the items:**
   - Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0 (94), but since Item 5 is also highly valued by Agent 0 (91), and Agent 2 values Item 4 highly (86), we assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 since it is highly valued by Agent 0 and less crucial to Agent 1.
   - For Agent 1, assign Item 2, which they value highly (69).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as they also value it highly (66).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 as they have no items yet and can take a lower-valued item.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, who gets a lesser valued item as their second allocation.

3. **Resulting allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 2 receives Items 1 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
