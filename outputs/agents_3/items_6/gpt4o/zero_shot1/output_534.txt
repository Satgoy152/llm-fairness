Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  18   6  29   3  75
1  57  47  15  67  97  79
2  47  91  84  91  17  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 47 15 67 97 79]
 [47 91 84 91 17 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 6 items being allocated in total. One common method of achieving fairness in allocation is to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that all agents receive a fair share of the items.

Let's consider the valuations given:

```
Agent 0: [92, 18, 6, 29, 3, 75]
Agent 1: [57, 47, 15, 67, 97, 79]
Agent 2: [47, 91, 84, 91, 17, 47]
```

We can proceed with the allocation in the following way:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 (value 92) highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 (value 97) highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 and item 3 equally (value 91 each), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as it also has a high valuation for that item.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1's value for item 2 (15) is the highest remaining valuation among items not yet allocated.
6. Finally, allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation (value 75) for this item.

Now, each agent receives an integer number of items, and we have allocated all 6 items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair distribution based on their preferences and the total number of items.
