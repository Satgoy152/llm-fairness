Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48   0  99  49  63  61
1  87  59  75  42  59   5
2  82  23  22  55  39  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One way to do this is by using a method such as the "maximum sum of valuations" or "Greedy allocation," where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 59.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 55.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.

By allocating each item to the agent that values it the most, we can achieve a fair distribution:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
