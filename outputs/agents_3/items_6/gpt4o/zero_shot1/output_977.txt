Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  25  99  32  48  76
1  63  61  95   9  58  56
2  73  85  99  47  28  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Given the table of valuations, let's distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as evenly balanced as possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items that have relatively high value for them compared to others.
- Agent 1 receives items that have relatively high value for them.
- Agent 2 receives items that have relatively high value for them.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

This allocation tries to balance out the total value each agent gets:

- Agent 0 receives: 32 (item 3) + 48 (item 4) = 80
- Agent 1 receives: 63 (item 0) + 56 (item 5) = 119
- Agent 2 receives: 85 (item 1) + 99 (item 2) = 184

While this allocation might not perfectly balance the total value among agents, it ensures that each agent receives items that are highly valued by them.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
