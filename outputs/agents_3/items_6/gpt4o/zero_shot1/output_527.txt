Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  24  71  55  68  70
1  24  50  81  19  92  58
2  25  43  86  73  88  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate the items.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items 0, 5 have relatively high values for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items 2, 4 have very high values for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items 1, 3 have relatively high values for Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures that each agent gets some items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3. 

This ensures that each agent gets items based on their preferences, and all 6 items are allocated.
