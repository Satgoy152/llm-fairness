Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  31  97   2  65  32
1  79  80  56  36  57  87
2  65  72  69  16  40  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation of the items for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's consider the following approach using a greedy method to maximize individual agent valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: 2 (97), 4 (65), 0 (56)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: 1 (80), 5 (87), 0 (79)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: 1 (72), 2 (69), 5 (68)

Now, let's assign the items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 2 (97) and Item 4 (65)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 5 (87) and Item 0 (79)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 1 (72) and Item 3 (16)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items with high value to them, while ensuring every agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
