Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  67  74  59  15  76
1  85  34  89  26  46  95
2  36  14  87  81  80  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that considers each agent's valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. There are various ways to approach this, such as maximizing the total value, ensuring envy-freeness, or other fairness criteria. For this instance, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (76), Item 2 (74), Item 1 (67)
   - Allocation: Item 5 and Item 2

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (95), Item 2 (89), Item 0 (85)
   - Allocation: Item 0 and Item 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (87), Item 3 (81), Item 4 (80)
   - Allocation: Item 1 and Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, aiming to respect their preferences as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers that each agent receives items with relatively high valuation from their perspective, while distributing the items fairly among the agents.
