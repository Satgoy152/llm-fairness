Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  13   8  20  75  87
1  43  29  20  44  58  19
2  12  98  72   0  98  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 98 72  0 98 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuation matrix while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 and 4 the most.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0:** It has a high value for Agent 0 (87).
2. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2:** It has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (98) and is also highly valued by Agent 1 (58). Since Agent 2 values it more, we assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0:** It has a high value for Agent 0 (69).
4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1:** It has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (44) among remaining items.
5. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 2:** It has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (98) among the remaining items.
6. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1:** It has the highest remaining value for Agent 1 (20).

With these allocations, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and each item is allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
