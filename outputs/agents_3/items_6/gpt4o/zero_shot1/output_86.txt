Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  47  76  76  65   3
1  39  81  94  13  76   7
2  50  12  18  53  62  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. A common approach to such a problem is to use a method like the "Maximin" algorithm or apply a heuristic to approximate a fair distribution. Here's one possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [13, 47, 76, 76, 65, 3]
   - Highest values: Items 2 and 3 (76 each)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [39, 81, 94, 13, 76, 7]
   - Highest values: Item 2 (94), then Item 1 (81)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [50, 12, 18, 53, 62, 61]
   - Highest values: Item 0 (50), then Item 4 (62)

Given these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** gets items [2, 3] since those have the highest combined value for them.
- **Agent 1** gets items [1, 4] to maximize their values.
- **Agent 2** gets items [0, 5] as these provide a fair distribution for their preferences.

Let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers the preference of each agent and distributes the items fairly based on their highest valuations.
