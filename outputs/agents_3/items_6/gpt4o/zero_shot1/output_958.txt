Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  61  80   4  83  47
1  62  97  96  93  43  33
2  70  32  79  70  11  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation, considering their valuations for the items. Since there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most and try to allocate those items to them.

2. **Consider fairness**: Ensure each agent gets a reasonable total value relative to the others.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 4 (83), Item 2 (80)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest values: Item 1 (97), Item 2 (96), Item 3 (93)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest values: Item 0 (70), Item 3 (70), Item 2 (79)

Considering these preferences, we aim to allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 4 (83)
  - Item 0 (23)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 1 (97)
  - Item 3 (93)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 2 (79)
  - Item 5 (55)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
