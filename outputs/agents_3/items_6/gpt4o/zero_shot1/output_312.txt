Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  81  33  82  31  12
1   9  73  96  81  80  65
2  91  18  71  86  80  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 81 33 82 31 12]
 [ 9 73 96 81 80 65]
 [91 18 71 86 80 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the "maximum sum" method, which aims to maximize the total valuation sum for all agents. We want each agent to get at least one item, or as close to a fair share as possible, based on their valuations.

Let's look at the values:

- Agent 0: [70, 81, 33, 82, 31, 12]
- Agent 1: [9, 73, 96, 81, 80, 65]
- Agent 2: [91, 18, 71, 86, 80, 99]

We'll assign items to agents by maximizing their values while ensuring each gets at least one item.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (99). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (96). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (82). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, we have:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]

Remaining items: [0, 1, 4]

4. Assign item 0 to **Agent 2** (91), as it has the highest value for this item.
5. Assign item 1 to **Agent 0** (81), as it has the highest value for this item.
6. Assign item 4 to **Agent 1** (80), as it has the highest value for this item among remaining options.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [3, 1]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 0]

Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```
