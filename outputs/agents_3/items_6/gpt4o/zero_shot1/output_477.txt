Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  53  84  34  56  13
1  80  57  51  22  40  81
2   9  71  93  28  77  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that takes into account each agent's preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are three agents and six items, each agent should ideally receive two items.

One way to approach this is to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 0 are: Item 2 (84) and Item 4 (56).
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 1 are: Item 0 (80) and Item 5 (81).
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Remaining items for Agent 2 are: Item 1 (71) and Item 3 (28).
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and it attempts to respect the agents' preferences based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
