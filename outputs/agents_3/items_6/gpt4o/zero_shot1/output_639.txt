Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  46  61  68  86  54
1  44  87  44  61   2  51
2  48   2  16  32  54  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48  2 16 32 54 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will try to distribute the items so that each agent receives approximately equal value, if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [77, 46, 61, 68, 86, 54]
- Agent 1 values: [44, 87, 44, 61, 2, 51]
- Agent 2 values: [48, 2, 16, 32, 54, 46]

First, we can look for the highest value each agent has for any item to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly. Then, we can allocate the remaining items to balance the total value among the agents.

1. Agent 0's highest valued item is item 4 (value 86).
2. Agent 1's highest valued item is item 1 (value 87).
3. Agent 2's highest valued item is item 4 (value 54), but since item 4 is already taken, the next highest is item 5 (value 46).

Let's allocate these high-valued items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.

Next, we allocate the remaining items [0, 2, 3] to ensure a fair distribution:

Agent 0 has item 4 valued at 86. They also value item 0 highly (77), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Agent 1 has item 1 valued at 87. We can allocate another item to Agent 1, considering their next highest valuations. Item 3 is valued at 61, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Agent 2 has item 5 valued at 46. The remaining item, item 2, should be given to Agent 2 as it is the only remaining item.

Now each agent has two items, and the allocation is balanced in terms of the number of items and attempts to balance the value.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
