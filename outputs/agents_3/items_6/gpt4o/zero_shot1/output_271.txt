Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  35   7  82  70  52
1  22  82  42  76  33  16
2  15   1  77  30  77  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure each agent receives a similar value in total, as much as possible, while ensuring each item is only assigned to one agent. We'll aim for a balanced distribution by considering the valuations.

Let's examine how we can allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuation on items: 3 (82), 4 (70), 0 (66)
   - Choose items 0 (66) and 4 (70) for a total value of 136.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuation on items: 1 (82), 3 (76), 2 (42)
   - Choose items 1 (82) and 3 (76) for a total value of 158.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuation on items: 2 (77), 5 (80), 4 (77)
   - Choose items 2 (77) and 5 (80) for a total value of 157.

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and the total values are reasonably balanced.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
