Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  83  57  74  70  25
1  21   3  66  33  87  70
2  65  20  11  70  87  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3
   - These items have valuations of 83 and 74 respectively, providing Agent 0 with a high total valuation.

2. **Agent 1**: Items 4, 5
   - These items have valuations of 87 and 70 respectively, which are high values for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Items 0, 2
   - These items have valuations of 65 and 11 respectively, which are relatively better for Agent 2 compared to others.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated two items, and all 6 items are distributed. The allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
