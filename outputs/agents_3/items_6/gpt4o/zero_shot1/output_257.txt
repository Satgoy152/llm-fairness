Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  43  88  18   7  79
1  50  95  51  70  62   4
2  17  67  87  73  70  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 43 88 18  7 79]
 [50 95 51 70 62  4]
 [17 67 87 73 70 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations for each agent and try to maximize their satisfaction by assigning items that they value the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Valuations Table
```
Agent 0: [15, 43, 88, 18, 7, 79]
Agent 1: [50, 95, 51, 70, 62, 4]
Agent 2: [17, 67, 87, 73, 70, 30]
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (88).
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (95).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly (87), but it's already chosen by Agent 0. The next highest is item 3 (73).

#### Allocating Other Items
- After allocating their highest valued items, we should ensure each agent gets at least one item.
- Next highest available for Agent 0 is item 5 (79).
- For Agent 1, item 4 (62) is the next highest available.
- For Agent 2, item 0 (17) is available, which is not optimal but ensures they get an item.

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 3, 0

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
