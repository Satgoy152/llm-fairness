Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58   9  90  26   8  57
1  22  38  49  33  30  90
2  82  24   5  99  70  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values the items as follows: [58, 9, 90, 26, 8, 57]
   - Highest value for item 2 (90)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values the items as follows: [22, 38, 49, 33, 30, 90]
   - Highest value for item 5 (90)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values the items as follows: [82, 24, 5, 99, 70, 42]
   - Highest value for item 3 (99)

Given these considerations, we should allocate the highest valued items to each agent first, then distribute the remaining items so that total valuations are balanced and all items are allocated. Here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [0, 2]
- **Agent 1** gets items: [1, 5]
- **Agent 2** gets items: [3, 4]

This distribution ensures all items are allocated while considering the preferences of the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
