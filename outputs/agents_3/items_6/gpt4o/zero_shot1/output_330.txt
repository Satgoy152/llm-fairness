Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  98  15  86  65  81
1  93  59   4  21  34  42
2   8  83  17  36  12  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 59  4 21 34 42]
 [ 8 83 17 36 12 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here is one possible allocation, keeping in mind the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Has highest valuation for item 1 (98).
   - Also has relatively high valuation for item 3 (86).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Has highest valuation for item 0 (93).
   - Also has significant valuation for item 4 (34).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Has highest valuation for item 5 (97).
   - Also has a relatively high valuation for item 1 (83), but item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest available valuation is for item 3 (36), but item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next high available valuation is for item 2 (17).

Using this analysis, the allocations can be:

- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 5 and 2 to Agent 2.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```
