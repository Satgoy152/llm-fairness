Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  56  62  80   6  13
1  67  28  67  73  15  81
2  22  89  17  76  14  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as there are six items and three agents. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 significantly higher than the others, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0. Additionally, item 3 has a high value for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1. Also, agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2. Additionally, item 4 can be given to agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, and all items are allocated.
