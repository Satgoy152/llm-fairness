Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  70  53  81  46  75
1  86  37  53  56  15  83
2  65  64  89   3  91  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated. One approach is to allocate items to agents by maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's go through the allocation process and aim for a balanced distribution.

1. Analyze the highest valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0's highest values: 81 (Item 3), 75 (Item 5), 70 (Item 1)
   - Agent 1's highest values: 86 (Item 0), 83 (Item 5), 56 (Item 3)
   - Agent 2's highest values: 91 (Item 4), 89 (Item 2), 65 (Item 0)

2. Allocate items based on maximizing value for each agent while ensuring fairness:
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value 91 for Agent 2)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value 75 for Agent 0, Agent 1 also values it highly but Agent 0 has fewer high-value options)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value 81 for Agent 0, Agent 1 also values it but Agent 0 has fewer high-value options)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value 86 for Agent 1)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest value 37 for Agent 1)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value 89 for Agent 2)

3. Ensure that all 6 items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
