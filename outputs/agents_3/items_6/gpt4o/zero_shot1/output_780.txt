Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9   0  71  62  47  46
1  56  48   8  62  54  11
2  16  10  13  41  27   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where we try to maximize each agent's satisfaction. One way to approach this is to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value: Item 2 (71)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (62)
   - Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (56)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (62) - but already taken
   - Next: Item 4 (54)
   - Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 3 (41) - but already taken
   - Next highest: Item 4 (27) - but already taken
   - Next: Item 0 (16) - but already taken
   - Next: Item 1 (10)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have assigned 5 items. The remaining item is 5, which should go to Agent 2 as they have the lowest total valuation so far:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while all items are allocated.
