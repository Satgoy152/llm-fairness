Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  41  64  96  92  25
1  64  57  55  24   7  32
2  26   7  71  12   9  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 41 64 96 92 25]
 [64 57 55 24  7 32]
 [26  7 71 12  9 12]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use a straightforward method by trying to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can do this by examining each agent's valuation for each item and allocating items to agents based on the highest valuations until all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [51, 41, 64, 96, 92, 25]
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (96) and 4 (92).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [64, 57, 55, 24, 7, 32]
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (64) and 1 (57).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: [26, 7, 71, 12, 9, 12]
   - Highest valuations are for items 2 (71) and 5 (12).

By following the highest valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
