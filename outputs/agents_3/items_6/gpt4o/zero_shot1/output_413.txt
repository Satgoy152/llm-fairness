Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  35   3  92  82  26
1  66  77  88  99   6  27
2  69  89  30  82  99  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach of maximizing the overall value for each agent. This isn't necessarily the optimal method for fairness, but it can serve as a straightforward allocation strategy.

Let's look at the allocation process step-by-step. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets some high-value items based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 3 (92), Item 4 (82), Item 0 (75).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 3 (99), Item 2 (88), Item 1 (77).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (since Item 3 is already taken).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 4 (99), Item 1 (89), Item 5 (71).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

Let's continue allocating the remaining items:

4. **For the remaining items** (0, 1, 5):
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value after Item 3).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value after Item 4).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value after Item 2).

Now, all items are allocated, ensuring each agent has some items and considering their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
