Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  79  93  32  26  60
1  34  74  59  24  53  74
2  71   8   8  26  54  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the overall allocation is optimal or balanced in some way. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method like the "maximum envy-free" allocation where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values theirs, or at least tries to minimize envy.

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations table:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. Agent 1 has relatively high valuations for items 1, 2, and 5.
3. Agent 2 has lower valuations overall but has moderate valuations for item 0 and 4.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 1, as they value these items highly and it balances their total valuation.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 2, since they have the next highest valuations for these items compared to what could be given to other agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, which is fair given there are three agents and six items.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This configuration ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving their most valued items, Agent 1 getting the next high-value items, and Agent 2 receiving the remaining items.
