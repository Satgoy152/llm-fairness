Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  28  53  89  60  92
1  54  85   9  50   4  48
2  94  18  52  24  39  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 28 53 89 60 92]
 [54 85  9 50  4 48]
 [94 18 52 24 39 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (as evenly as possible). Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 0 (60), 2 (53), 3 (89), and 5 (92).
   - Assign items 0, 3, and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has high valuations for items 1 (85).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has high valuations for items 0 (94), 2 (52), and 5 (73).
   - Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes their total valuation for the items they receive. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
