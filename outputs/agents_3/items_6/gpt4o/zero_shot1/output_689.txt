Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  94  12  58  93  14
1  99  60  83  93  92  94
2  64  32  50  63  75  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 60 83 93 92 94]
 [64 32 50 63 75 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, while ensuring no agent receives more than two items (since there are 6 items and 3 agents).

2. Check for a combination where the total valuation for each agent is maximized.

Let's start with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (94), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (99), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 1 also values item 3 highly (93), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (75), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 5 (14), but agent 1 values it more (94), so assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (50), so assign item 2 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4.

Please verify that this allocation meets your requirements and adjust if necessary.
