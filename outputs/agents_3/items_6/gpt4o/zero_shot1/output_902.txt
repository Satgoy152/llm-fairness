Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  50  42   4  75  40
1  14  74  55  82  63  16
2  14  25  89  21  57  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a method such as maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuation table, we aim to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction (total valuation) is maximized. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (75), Item 1 (50), Item 2 (42)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 1 (74), Item 2 (55)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 4 (57), Item 5 (30)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** can also take Item 1 (50) since it has a high valuation for it.
- **Agent 1** can take Item 5 (16) since it has the next highest valuation for it.
- **Agent 2** can take Item 0 (14) since it has a low valuation for most items but still values this one equally with Agent 1.

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation based on the distribution of preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
