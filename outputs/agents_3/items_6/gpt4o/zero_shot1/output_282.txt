Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  71  19  41  94  15
1  56  16  68  73  57  23
2  16  42  47  92  59  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a breakdown of the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most with a value of 94.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most with a value of 73.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a value of 92, but since item 3 is already assigned to agent 1, we look at the next highest value.
4. Agent 2 values item 4 at 59, but since item 4 is already assigned to agent 0, we look further.
5. Assign items based on the remaining highest values per agent.

Let's proceed with an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed:

- Item 4 is assigned to Agent 0 (value 94).
- Item 0 is assigned to Agent 1 (value 56).
- Item 3 is assigned to Agent 2 (value 92).
- Item 2 is assigned to Agent 1 (value 68).
- Item 1 is assigned to Agent 0 (value 71).
- Item 5 is assigned to Agent 2 (value 19).

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest preferences available after considering previous assignments.
