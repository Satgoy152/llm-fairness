Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  86  23  44   0   9
1  42  43  16  24  57  44
2  92  61   7  69  37  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to balance the distribution so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Let's go through the items and allocate them to the agents:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Agent 2 values it at 92.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 43.
   - Agent 2 values it at 61.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Agent 2 values it at 7.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Agent 2 values it at 69.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 57.
   - Agent 2 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9.
   - Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - Agent 2 values it at 68.
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

The allocation based on these decisions is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is based on their preferences.
