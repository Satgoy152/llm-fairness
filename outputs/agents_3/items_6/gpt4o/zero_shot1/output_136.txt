Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70   0  56  41  82  28
1  86  26  86  60  32  73
2  47  54  85  39  94  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 54 85 39 94 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:** Start by identifying which agent values each item the most.
2. **Assign items based on highest valuations:** Assign items to the agent who values them the most, if possible.
3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:** Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get 2 items for a balanced allocation. Adjust if any agent doesn't have items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest).
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it at 54 (highest).
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest).
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it at 60 (highest).
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it at 94 (highest).
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it at 73 (highest).

Now, let's adjust to ensure each agent gets items fairly. Agent 0 currently has no items, so we'll reassign some items:

1. **Reallocate for fairness:**
    - Swap Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 70, which is still high.
    - Move Item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it at 41, which is reasonable.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 5
- **Agent 2:** Items 1, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
