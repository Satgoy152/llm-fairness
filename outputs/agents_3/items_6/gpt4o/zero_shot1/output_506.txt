Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45   7  79  92  29  91
1  78  41  52  73  87  28
2  55   9  96   6   9  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45  7 79 92 29 91]
 [78 41 52 73 87 28]
 [55  9 96  6  9 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and that all items are allocated.

Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 45 + 7 + 79 + 92 + 29 + 91 = 343
   - Agent 1: 78 + 41 + 52 + 73 + 87 + 28 = 359
   - Agent 2: 55 + 9 + 96 + 6 + 9 + 77 = 252

2. Allocate items to each agent by selecting items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5 (92, 91)
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4 (78, 87)
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 1 (96, 9)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of high-value items according to their preferences.

Now, presenting this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
