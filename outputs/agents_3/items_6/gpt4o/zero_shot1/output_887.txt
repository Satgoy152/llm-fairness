Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  39  36  97  40  81
1  94  60  17  80  46  76
2  81  44  95  59   7  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 60 17 80 46 76]
 [81 44 95 59  7 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider both the valuations and the goal of giving each agent an integer number of items. We have 6 items and 3 agents, so ideally each agent should receive 2 items to ensure fairness in the number of items received. Let's consider the valuations and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while attempting to distribute the items fairly.

Here are the valuations again for reference:

```
Agent 0: [23, 39, 36, 97, 40, 81]
Agent 1: [94, 60, 17, 80, 46, 76]
Agent 2: [81, 44, 95, 59,  7, 17]
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with highest values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with highest values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with highest values for Agent 2.

### Steps:
- **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 3 and 5 (97 and 81). Assign these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 0 and 3 (94 and 80). Item 3 is already taken, so assign items 0 and 1 (94 and 60).
- **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 2 and 0 (95 and 81). Item 0 is already taken, so assign items 2 and 4 (95 and 7).

After considering which items have been taken, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [3, 5].
- **Agent 1** gets items [0, 1].
- **Agent 2** gets items [2, 4].

This allocation gives each agent 2 items, respecting the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items and maximizing their respective valuations based on availability.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
