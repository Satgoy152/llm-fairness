Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  36  24  73  62  43
1  68  61  13  15   4  55
2  25  35  19  27  73  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most. We also need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (73), Item 0 (45), Item 4 (62).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 as it has the highest valuation.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (68), Item 1 (61), Item 5 (55).
   - Since Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1 and not yet allocated, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (73), Item 5 (48), Item 1 (35).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2 as it has the highest valuation.

4. **Remaining items (1, 2, 5):**
   - For efficiency and fairness, consider remaining items and agents' preferences:
     - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
     - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest remaining valuation).

5. **Final allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2 as it is the last unallocated item and Agent 2 has space.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
