Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  48  79  95  71  15
1  50   5  89  56   7  85
2  44  45  32  32  77  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is relatively satisfied with their allocation. Given that there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 2 (95 and 79 respectively). Assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After allocating items 3 and 2 to Agent 0, we consider Agent 1's next highest valuations. Items 5 and 0 have valuations of 85 and 50 respectively. Assign these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The remaining items are 1 and 4. Agent 2 values item 4 higher than item 1 (77 vs 45). Assign these items to Agent 2.

Let's verify that the allocation is fair:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, their two highest valued items.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 0, two of their highest valued items.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4, their highest valued item remaining.

This setup ensures each agent receives 2 items, maximizing their satisfaction according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
