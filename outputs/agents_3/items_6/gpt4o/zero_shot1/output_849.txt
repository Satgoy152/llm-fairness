Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  81   2  71  17  77
1  97   1  30  78  25  64
2  84  27  52  59  11  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 81  2 71 17 77]
 [97  1 30 78 25 64]
 [84 27 52 59 11 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [61, 81, 2, 71, 17, 77]
- Agent 1 values: [97, 1, 30, 78, 25, 64]
- Agent 2 values: [84, 27, 52, 59, 11, 41]

To achieve a fair allocation:
1. Each agent should ideally receive two items since there are three agents and six items.
2. We will try to allocate items to maximize the value each agent receives from their allocation.

Steps:
1. Assign the highest value item to the agent who values it the most, then move to the next highest value.
2. Continue until all items are allocated and each agent has an approximately equal share of their maximum possible value.

Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items with values [81, 77].
- Agent 1 gets items with values [97, 78].
- Agent 2 gets items with values [84, 52].

Here's how this translates to item numbers:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5 (values 81 and 77)
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3 (values 97 and 78)
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4 (values 52 and 11)

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, with the distribution attempting to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
