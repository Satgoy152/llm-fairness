Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  81  58  66  57  71
1  53  28  85  29  53  81
2  61   9  24  20  38  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go step by step:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (81)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (71)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (66)

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (85)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (81)
   - Third highest: Item 0 (53)

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (61)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (38)
   - Third highest: Item 5 (32)

To ensure a fair distribution, let's allocate items based on the highest values for each agent, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

1. Assign Agent 0 their highest valued item: Item 1 (81)
2. Assign Agent 1 their highest valued item: Item 2 (85)
3. Assign Agent 2 their highest valued item: Item 0 (61)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

4. Assign Agent 0 their next highest valued item: Item 5 (71)
5. Assign Agent 1 their next highest valued item: Item 3 (29)
6. Assign Agent 2 their next highest valued item: Item 4 (38)

Each agent gets two items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that tries to maximize their individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
