Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  57  59  92  78  84
1  64  44  86  26  28  10
2  87  86  25   5  68  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 86 25  5 68 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly:

**Valuations Table:**

- Agent 0: Items - [0: 30, 1: 57, 2: 59, 3: 92, 4: 78, 5: 84]
- Agent 1: Items - [0: 64, 1: 44, 2: 86, 3: 26, 4: 28, 5: 10]
- Agent 2: Items - [0: 87, 1: 86, 2: 25, 3: 5, 4: 68, 5: 53]

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0** seems to highly value items 3, 4, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** places the highest value on item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 1.

**Suggested Allocations:**

- Assign items 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 0, as these have the highest combined value for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 2, as these are their highest-valued items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value highly, and all items are distributed.

**Final Allocations in JSON:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
