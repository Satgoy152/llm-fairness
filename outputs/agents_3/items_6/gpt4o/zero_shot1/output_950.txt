Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  16  30  97  40  67
1  58  22  83  53  55  83
2  25  62   6  83  74  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 67
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 30
- Item 3: 97
- Item 4: 40
- Item 5: 67

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 83
- Item 3: 53
- Item 4: 55
- Item 5: 83

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 62
- Item 2: 6
- Item 3: 83
- Item 4: 74
- Item 5: 22

To achieve a fair allocation, we should aim to allocate items in such a way that takes into account the highest valuations for each item while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share. Here is one possible way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (97).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 and item 5 (both 83).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (83) but since agent 0 values it more, we can give them other items like 4 (74) and 1 (62).

Based on these considerations, here is a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 0]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and the allocations maximize each agent's preferences as much as possible under the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
