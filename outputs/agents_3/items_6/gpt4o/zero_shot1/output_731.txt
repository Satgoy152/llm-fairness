Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  82  81  65  20  14
1  16  86   4  62  26  65
2  62  28  64  50  36  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction, we can use the following approach:

1. **Assign the highest value items first**: This ensures that items go to the agent who values them the most.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible**: Since there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally get 2 items.

Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (85).
- **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (86).
- **Item 2**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (81).
- **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (62).
- **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (36).
- **Item 5**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (91).

Allocating based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets an item:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3].
- Agent 2 gets items [4, 5].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the items are allocated to the agents who value them the most.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
