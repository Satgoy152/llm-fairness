Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  90  22  59  47  50
1  25   1  46  31  22  54
2  54  34   6  56  80  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25  1 46 31 22 54]
 [54 34  6 56 80 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation or ensuring a balanced distribution. Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (90) and could benefit greatly from receiving this item.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5 (54), which could be the best allocation for them.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (93), but since item 5 is already given to Agent 1, we can consider items that are still available and highly valued by Agent 2.

A balanced allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3].
- Agent 1 gets items [5].
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 2, 4].

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and we attempted to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction based on their valuations.
