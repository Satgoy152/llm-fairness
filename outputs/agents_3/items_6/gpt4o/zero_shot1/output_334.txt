Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  17  20  16  49  40
1  55  94  93  96  66  21
2  69  36  55  79  54  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 17 20 16 49 40]
 [55 94 93 96 66 21]
 [69 36 55 79 54 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [97, 17, 20, 16, 49, 40]
Agent 1: [55, 94, 93, 96, 66, 21]
Agent 2: [69, 36, 55, 79, 54, 45]
```

We will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring fairness. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 97).
2. Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4 (values 96 and 66).
3. Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 5 (values 36, 55, and 45).

This allocation considers both maximizing the value for each agent and distributing the 6 items fairly.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
