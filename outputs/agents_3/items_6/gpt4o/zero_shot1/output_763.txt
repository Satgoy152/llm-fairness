Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  49  63  73  80  88
1  26  78  51  67  52  52
2  50   2  29  46   8  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. The goal is to achieve a fair distribution, which often involves balancing the values across agents.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuations for multiple items, so they should receive high-value items where possible.
2. Agent 1 has moderate valuations across the board.
3. Agent 2 has lower valuations but should still receive items to ensure fairness.

A potential allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (value 88) and item 4 (value 80).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 1 (value 78) and item 3 (value 67).
- Agent 2: Allocate item 0 (value 50) and item 2 (value 29).

This allocation gives each agent two items and tries to distribute the value fairly among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
