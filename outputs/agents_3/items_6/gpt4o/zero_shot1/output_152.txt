Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  35  24  31  65  33
1  18  87  54  81  94  94
2  73  12   1  25  31  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [73 12  1 25 31 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 has relatively low valuations compared to Agent 1 in most cases, but they value item 5 (33) higher than Agent 2 (66).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items 1, 3, 4, and 5.
   - Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1 since their valuations are significantly higher for these items.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (73), which is much higher than what others value it.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2 remains, and Agent 0 values it (24) more than Agent 2 (1), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Hereâ€™s how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
