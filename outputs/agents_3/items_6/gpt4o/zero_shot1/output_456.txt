Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  45  58  81  82  76
1  83  14  10  51  96  84
2  95  86  42  18  20   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One potential method is to allocate items based on the highest value for each agent in a round-robin or balanced manner. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (81), 4 (82)

2. Agent 1: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (83), 5 (84)

3. Agent 2: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (86), 2 (42)

This allocation ensures each agent receives 2 items, and the distribution is balanced in terms of maximizing individual agent utility based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
