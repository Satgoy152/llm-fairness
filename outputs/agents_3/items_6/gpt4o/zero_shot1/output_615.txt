Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  99   6   1  99  61
1   2  22  48  86  38  64
2   5  84  26  48  21  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 84 26 48 21 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (value) for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0's valuation:
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 99
- Item 2: 6
- Item 3: 1
- Item 4: 99
- Item 5: 61

Agent 1's valuation:
- Item 0: 2
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 48
- Item 3: 86
- Item 4: 38
- Item 5: 64

Agent 2's valuation:
- Item 0: 5
- Item 1: 84
- Item 2: 26
- Item 3: 48
- Item 4: 21
- Item 5: 61

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 4 (both 99). Assign these to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (86). Assign this to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (84), but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (61). Assign this to Agent 2.
4. Continue to allocate remaining items based on the next highest values while making sure each agent receives at least one item.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 0]

This allocation attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```
