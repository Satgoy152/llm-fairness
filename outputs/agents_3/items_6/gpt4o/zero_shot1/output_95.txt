Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  13   9   4  67  60
1  59  63  29  16  11  21
2   8   9  44  47  94  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 13  9  4 67 60]
 [59 63 29 16 11 21]
 [ 8  9 44 47 94 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [95, 13, 9, 4, 67, 60]
- Agent 1 values: [59, 63, 29, 16, 11, 21]
- Agent 2 values: [8, 9, 44, 47, 94, 64]

We'll attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives high-value items based on their individual valuations.

A potential allocation could be:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0: 95 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 1: 13 (second highest available value for Agent 0)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: 16
   - Item 5: 21 (Agent 1 has higher value for these compared to others)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: 44
   - Item 4: 94 (Agent 2 values these the most)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual total value based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
