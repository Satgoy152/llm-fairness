Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  55  33  64  36  31
1  45  63  78  82  36  53
2   2  42  57  19  84  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 55 33 64 36 31]
 [45 63 78 82 36 53]
 [ 2 42 57 19 84 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we would aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation of items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 0 (Value: 73)
   - Item 3 (Value: 64)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 2 (Value: 78)
   - Item 1 (Value: 63)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 4 (Value: 84)
   - Item 5 (Value: 98)

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the total valuations are maximized for the agents based on their given preferences. Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
