Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  29  59  46  88  25
1  78  37  72  54  48  38
2  41  93  22  22   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 93 22 22  3 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the table of valuations, we proceed by trying to balance the overall satisfaction:

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as it has the highest valuation (88) among all allocations.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (78) for that particular item.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as it has the highest valuation (93) for that particular item.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 1, as it has a relatively good valuation (38).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as it has a relatively good valuation (46).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 has a decent valuation (59) for this leftover item.

Now, each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that items are distributed while trying to maximize the valuation for each agent, given the constraints.
