Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  29  10  45  75  23
1   1  61  67   3   2  13
2  81  73  85  91  90  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [81 73 85 91 90 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 4 the most (75), so we will assign item 4 to them.
2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 2 the most (67), so we will assign item 2 to them.
3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 3 the most (91), so we will assign item 3 to them.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, and 5) fairly:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values this item the most (81), so we will assign item 0 to them.
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 also values this item highly (73), so we will assign item 1 to them.
- **Item 5:** Agent 2 values item 5 more than the others (51), so we will assign item 5 to them.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their highest valuation preferences.
