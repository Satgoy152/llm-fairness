Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  12  35  50   6  84
1   6  43  62  96  19  40
2  97  77   1  85  91  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 43 62 96 19 40]
 [97 77  1 85 91 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (88). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Next, agent 0 values item 5 the second most (84). Assign item 5 to agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (96). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - Next, agent 1 values item 2 the second most (62). Assign item 2 to agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (91). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
   - Next, agent 2 values item 1 the second most (77). Assign item 1 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has been allocated two items, and all six items are distributed. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
