Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  30  62  52  97  13
1  18  42  20  11  97  30
2  42  35  76  60  62  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 42 20 11 97 30]
 [42 35 76 60 62 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [27, 30, 62, 52, 97, 13]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [18, 42, 20, 11, 97, 30]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [42, 35, 76, 60, 62, 75]

By examining the valuations, we can allocate by selecting the highest available value for each agent's turn, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can aim to give each agent two items as there are six items and three agents.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 4 (97). They also have a high value for item 2 (62).
- **Agent 1** should take item 1 (42) and item 5 (30) as these are their next highest values.
- **Agent 2** can take items 3 (60) and 0 (42) as these are their higher values among the remaining items.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 0.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
