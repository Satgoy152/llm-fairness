Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  16   0  97  91  30
1  20   9  71   1  42  99
2   7  67  25  58  64  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20  9 71  1 42 99]
 [ 7 67 25 58 64 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility or value each agent gets from their allocated items. We will ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as [16, 16, 0, 97, 91, 30]
- Agent 1 values items as [20, 9, 71, 1, 42, 99]
- Agent 2 values items as [7, 67, 25, 58, 64, 82]

A possible allocation could be:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0 at 97).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 at 99).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2 at 67).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest remaining value for Agent 0 at 91).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest remaining value for Agent 1 at 71).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (remaining item, with value 7, but since Agent 2 already got a high-value item, it's fair).

Thus, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has items and the total value each agent receives is considered fairly based on their valuations.
