Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  38  89  35  21  35
1  51  59  45  23  84   7
2  63  26  33  24  28  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Below is one way to allocate the items considering their valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** can take items not highly valued by others, like items 1 and 5.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 5

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuation preferences, while also ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent has an integer number of items.
