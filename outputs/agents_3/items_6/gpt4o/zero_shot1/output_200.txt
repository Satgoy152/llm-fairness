Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  75  12  95  29  20
1  81  21   5  68   7  93
2  33  69  18  72  40  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 21  5 68  7 93]
 [33 69 18 72 40 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent and ensure each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 68
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 95
- Item 4: 29
- Item 5: 20

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 21
- Item 2: 5
- Item 3: 68
- Item 4: 7
- Item 5: 93

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 33
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 18
- Item 3: 72
- Item 4: 40
- Item 5: 62

A fair allocation strategy would allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 95).
2. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value 93).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (value 69).

Now, assign remaining items ensuring each gets at least one item and maximize their remaining value:

4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 81).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 40).
6. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 12).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 2
- Agent 1: Items 5, 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
