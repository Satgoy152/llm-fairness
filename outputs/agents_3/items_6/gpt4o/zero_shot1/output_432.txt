Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  49  74  15  49   9
1  71  67   9  34  57  13
2  39  75  77   1   2  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate each item to the agent that values it the most while ensuring that every agent gets an integer number of items.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 71, Agent 2 at 39. Highest valuation: Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 67, Agent 2 at 75. Highest valuation: Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 9, Agent 2 at 77. Highest valuation: Agent 2.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 34, Agent 2 at 1. Highest valuation: Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 57, Agent 2 at 2. Highest valuation: Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 13, Agent 2 at 30. Highest valuation: Agent 2.

2. **Allocate the items to the agents based on the highest valuation:**
   - Item 0 is allocated to Agent 0.
   - Items 1 and 2 are allocated to Agent 2.
   - Items 3 and 4 are allocated to Agent 1.
   - Item 5 is allocated to Agent 2.

3. **Ensure each agent has at least an integer number of items and the total allocation is six items.**

Following this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1, 2, and 5.
- All items are allocated exactly once, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
