Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  96  69  49  11  96
1  72  50  25  64  15   9
2  35  14  22  87  62  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 96 69 49 11 96]
 [72 50 25 64 15  9]
 [35 14 22 87 62 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [41, 96, 69, 49, 11, 96]
- Agent 1 values: [72, 50, 25, 64, 15, 9]
- Agent 2 values: [35, 14, 22, 87, 62, 38]

A reasonable approach is to allocate the highest-valued items for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. **Assigning the top value items:**
   - Agent 0's highest value items are 1 and 5 (both valued at 96).
   - Agent 1's highest value item is 0 (valued at 72).
   - Agent 2's highest value item is 3 (valued at 87).

2. **Ensuring all items are allocated:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 69).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (valued at 62).

3. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1: Item [0]
   - Agent 2: Items [3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives valuable items according to their preferences while distributing all items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
