Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  14   6  62  91  12
1  80  98  29  61  90  30
2  58  35  83  95  50  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [58 35 83 95 50 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach, where items are assigned based on the highest valuation of available items for each agent. 

Let's consider the highest-value items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (91).
   - Second-highest is item 3 (62).
   - Third-highest is item 1 (14).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (98).
   - Second-highest is item 0 (80).
   - Third-highest is item 4 (90).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (95).
   - Second-highest is item 2 (83).
   - Third-highest is item 5 (72).

Next, we allocate these items to each agent while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it is Agent 0’s highest-valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it is Agent 1’s highest-valued item.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it is Agent 2’s highest-valued item.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because it is also highly valued by Agent 1 and not yet allocated.
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 because it is highly valued by Agent 2 and not yet allocated.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 has a strong preference for it and it’s not yet allocated).

The allocation based on this greedy approach is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
