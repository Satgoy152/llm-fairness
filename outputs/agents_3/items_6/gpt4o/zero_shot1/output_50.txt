Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  48  71  95  65  20
1  12  85  99  19  61   4
2  44  99  21  80  13  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. There are multiple approaches to achieve this, such as using a greedy algorithm or attempting an optimal allocation. Here, we'll try to allocate items based on maximizing individual agent valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [41, 48, 71, 95, 65, 20]
- Agent 1: [12, 85, 99, 19, 61, 4]
- Agent 2: [44, 99, 21, 80, 13, 57]

A possible allocation approach:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation to each agent.
2. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Using this strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (95).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (99).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (99).

After assigning these items, the items left are 0, 4, and 5.

Using the remaining items:

- Agent 0's next highest unassigned item is 2 (71).
- Agent 1's next highest unassigned item is 4 (61).
- Agent 2's next highest unassigned item is 5 (57).

Now, each agent has two items:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 0
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed across the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
