Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  74  17  92  81  76
1  83  34  60  80  90  34
2  11  26  94  32  94  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and try to distribute the high-value items based on each agent's preferences.

Let's evaluate the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the following valuations: [42, 74, 17, 92, 81, 76]
2. **Agent 1** has the following valuations: [83, 34, 60, 80, 90, 34]
3. **Agent 2** has the following valuations: [11, 26, 94, 32, 94, 58]

We'll start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.

1. **Assign item 3** to Agent 0 (valuation 92)
2. **Assign item 4** to Agent 1 (valuation 90)
3. **Assign item 2** to Agent 2 (valuation 94)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 1 (74)
- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 (83)
- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (58)

We try to distribute the remaining high-value items fairly:

4. **Assign item 1** to Agent 0
5. **Assign item 0** to Agent 1
6. **Assign item 5** to Agent 2

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences for at least one item and distributes the rest fairly based on the remaining high values.

Here is the final allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
