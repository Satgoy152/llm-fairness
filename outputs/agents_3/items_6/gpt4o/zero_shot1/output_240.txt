Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  22  81  77  47  40
1  65  37  29  87   0   1
2  77  99  15   6  80  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible with an equal distribution). In this case, there are 6 items and 3 agents, so ideally each agent should get 2 items.

Let's assign the items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (93), Item 2 (81)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (87), Item 0 (65) - but item 0 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest values: Item 1 (37)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (80)

Considering the above, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 3 and 1
- **Agent 2:** Items 4 and 5

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
