Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  40  30  19  40  19
1  45   8  60   0  64  98
2  42   4  78  29  18  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for all agents. One common method is to allocate items in a way that balances fairness and efficiency, potentially using an approach like maximizing the minimum value each agent receives.

Given the valuations in the table, let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (66), Item 1 (40), Item 4 (40).
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 4 (64), Item 2 (60).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (since item 4 is already allocated).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (78), Item 5 (58), Item 3 (29).
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 2 (since item 5 is already allocated).

After the above allocations, we have distributed 5 items (0, 2, 3, 4, 5). Item 1 is unallocated. 

To allocate item 1, we check the remaining valuations:
- Agent 0: 40
- Agent 1: 8
- Agent 2: 4

Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, we have a complete allocation of all 6 items:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
