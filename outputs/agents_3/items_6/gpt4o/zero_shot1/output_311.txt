Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  18  59  30  94  57
1  56  15  26  23  90  30
2  50  84  11  98   0  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 84 11 98  0 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value per item for each agent**: 
   - For item 0, agent 1 values it the most at 56.
   - For item 1, agent 2 values it the most at 84.
   - For item 2, agent 0 values it the most at 59.
   - For item 3, agent 2 values it the most at 98.
   - For item 4, agent 0 values it the most at 94.
   - For item 5, agent 2 values it the most at 80.

2. **Assign items based on these maximum valuations**:
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2.

3. **Check the distribution**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0.
   - Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 5.

The allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 6. Here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
