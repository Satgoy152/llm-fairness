Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  48  84  19  52   0
1  87  93  35  75  53  68
2  89  54  50  32  49  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations for each item. One approach is to use a method like the "maximin" or a "greedy" approach to ensure each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation. Here's one possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

Let's consider each agent and their highest valued items:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (84) and 0 (58).
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 (93), 0 (87), and 3 (75).
- **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 (89), 1 (54), and 2 (50).

To allocate fairly, we might assign as follows:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their second highest valued item.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, where Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation compared to others.
6. Finally, allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has a reasonable valuation for it.

With this allocation, each agent gets two items, and the valuations are fairly distributed based on their highest preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
