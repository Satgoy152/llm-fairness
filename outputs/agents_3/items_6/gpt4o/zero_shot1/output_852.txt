Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  17  59   2  69  44
1  43  40   4  51   7  73
2  35  67  81  74  35  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 67 81 74 35 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent according to their preferences. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is fair, meaning each agent gets a reasonable share of their most valued items. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (69), 2 (59), 5 (44)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (73), 3 (51), 0 (43)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (90), 2 (81), 3 (74)

Let's now assign these items based on maximizing total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (69) and item 2 (59)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (73) and item 0 (43)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (74) and item 1 (67)

This allocation respects the high-value preferences of each agent and ensures each gets two items, which seems to balance the allocation well given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
