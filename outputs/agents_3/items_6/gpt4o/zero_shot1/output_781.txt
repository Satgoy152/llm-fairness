Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  48   5  17  53  44
1  24  93  39  50  88  74
2  60  20  85  73  26  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to iteratively assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. 

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: [23, 48, 5, 17, 53, 44]
- Agent 1 values: [24, 93, 39, 50, 88, 74]
- Agent 2 values: [60, 20, 85, 73, 26, 76]

To allocate items, we'll first determine which agent values each item the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 23
   - Agent 1: 24
   - Agent 2: 60 (highest value)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 48
   - Agent 1: 93 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 20

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 5
   - Agent 1: 39
   - Agent 2: 85 (highest value)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 17
   - Agent 1: 50
   - Agent 2: 73 (highest value)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 53
   - Agent 1: 88 (highest value)
   - Agent 2: 26

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0: 44
   - Agent 1: 74
   - Agent 2: 76 (highest value)

Now let's allocate the items to each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than three items:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (allocated based on the next highest preference for item 4, since item 4 was already allocated to Agent 1).
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 3, and 5.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 5]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
