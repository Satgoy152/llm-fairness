Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  84  53  24  64  64
1  36  92   9  39  39  39
2  89   6  32  44  73  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 84 53 24 64 64]
 [36 92  9 39 39 39]
 [89  6 32 44 73 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (or total valuation) of the agents is maximized.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [41, 84, 53, 24, 64, 64]
Agent 1: [36, 92, 9, 39, 39, 39]
Agent 2: [89, 6, 32, 44, 73, 46]
```

We need to allocate a total of 6 items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the items with the highest value for Agent 0. The highest values are for items 1 and 5 (both valued at 64). Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign the item with the highest value for Agent 1. This is item 1, but since it's already assigned, the next highest is item 0 (value 36). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign the item with the highest value for Agent 2. This is item 0 (value 89), but since it's already assigned, the next highest is item 4 (value 73). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 3, and 5. Continuing to allocate items based on high remaining values:

4. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 53).
5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 39).
6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (value 46).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
