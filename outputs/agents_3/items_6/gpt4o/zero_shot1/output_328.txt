Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  29  13  60   1  37
1  47  88  19   6  16  77
2  26  94  34  29  34  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We will ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that all 6 items are allocated.

Let's examine the values:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 86
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 13
- Item 3: 60
- Item 4: 1
- Item 5: 37

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 47
- Item 1: 88
- Item 2: 19
- Item 3: 6
- Item 4: 16
- Item 5: 77

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 94
- Item 2: 34
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 34
- Item 5: 10

To allocate fairly:
1. Assign each agent their highest valued item first if possible.
2. Repeat the process to allocate remaining items.

Allocation:
- Agent 0 highly values item 0 (86).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (88).
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 (94), but since item 1 is already assigned, consider the next highest, which is item 2 (34).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- Agent 0 can pick item 3 (60).
- Agent 1 can pick item 5 (77).
- Agent 2 can pick item 4 (34).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

All 6 items are allocated among the 3 agents.
