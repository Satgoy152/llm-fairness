Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47   0   2  89  17  32
1  52  79  38  75  19  24
2   3  41  16  21  97  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

One possible approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, as long as the total number of items each agent receives is approximately equal.

Let's break down the allocations based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 (value 89) is the highest value for Agent 0 and also the highest for Item 3 among all agents.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1 (value 79) is the highest value for Agent 1 and also the highest for Item 1 among all agents.
   - Item 2 (value 38) is the highest value for Agent 1 and also the highest for Item 2 among all agents.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 4 (value 97) is the highest value for Agent 2 and also the highest for Item 4 among all agents.
   - Item 5 (value 62) is the highest value for Agent 2 and also the highest for Item 5 among all agents.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate one more item, and the remaining unallocated item is Item 0:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most at 52.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
