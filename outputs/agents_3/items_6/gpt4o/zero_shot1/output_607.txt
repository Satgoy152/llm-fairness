Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  64  27  73  77  13
1  86  43  55  99  64  70
2  93  19   6  67  59  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 64 27 73 77 13]
 [86 43 55 99 64 70]
 [93 19  6 67 59 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A simple approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum bipartite matching" or "assignment problem" where we maximize the sum of valuations.

Here's one potential allocation that could work:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2: This gives agent 2 a high valuation of 93.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0: This gives agent 0 a valuation of 64.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1: This gives agent 1 a valuation of 55.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1: This gives agent 1 a high valuation of 99.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0: This gives agent 0 a valuation of 77.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2: This gives agent 2 a valuation of 44.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation received:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4 with a total valuation of 64 + 77 = 141.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3 with a total valuation of 55 + 99 = 154.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 5 with a total valuation of 93 + 44 = 137.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
