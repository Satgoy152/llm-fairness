Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  98  69  76  45  11
1   1   3  97   4   5  79
2  46  18  75  81  27  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 98 69 76 45 11]
 [ 1  3 97  4  5 79]
 [46 18 75 81 27 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives an unfairly large advantage. We will consider the valuations and make allocations accordingly.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [52, 98, 69, 76, 45, 11]
Agent 1: [1, 3, 97, 4, 5, 79]
Agent 2: [46, 18, 75, 81, 27, 76]
```

We can proceed with the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Assign item 1 (value 98) and item 3 (value 76) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 2 and 5. Assign item 2 (value 97) and item 5 (value 79) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The remaining items are 0 and 4. Assign item 0 (value 46) and item 4 (value 27) to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and it attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent within the constraints.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
