Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  27  57  83  32   4
1  18  83  36  96   9  80
2  56  51  60  15  98  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 51 60 15 98 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most but also ensures that each agent ends up with a roughly equal number of items.

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Values: Agent 0 = 6, Agent 1 = 18, Agent 2 = 56
   - Assign to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Values: Agent 0 = 27, Agent 1 = 83, Agent 2 = 51
   - Assign to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Values: Agent 0 = 57, Agent 1 = 36, Agent 2 = 60
   - Assign to Agent 2

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Values: Agent 0 = 83, Agent 1 = 96, Agent 2 = 15
   - Assign to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Values: Agent 0 = 32, Agent 1 = 9, Agent 2 = 98
   - Assign to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Values: Agent 0 = 4, Agent 1 = 80, Agent 2 = 62
   - Assign to Agent 1

After this allocation, we have the following distribution:

- Agent 0: 0 items
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 3 items

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
