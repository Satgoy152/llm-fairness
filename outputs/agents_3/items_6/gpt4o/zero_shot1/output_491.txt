Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  80  69  79   5  86
1  34  84   6  36  56  86
2  82  99  33  57   9  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 84  6 36 56 86]
 [82 99 33 57  9 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since we have 3 agents and 6 items).

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose items for Agent 0 with high valuations. Items 5 (valuation 86) and 3 (valuation 79) are ideal choices.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items for Agent 1 next. Items 1 (valuation 84) and 0 (valuation 34) are reasonable choices.
3. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate the remaining items to Agent 2. Items 2 (valuation 33) and 4 (valuation 9) are the remaining items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least an item and optimizes the value allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation is fair in terms of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
