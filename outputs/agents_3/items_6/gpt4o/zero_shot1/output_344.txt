Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  79  41  51  69  33
1  88  69  63  43  72   9
2  15  10  77  90  63   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 69 63 43 72  9]
 [15 10 77 90 63  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (79) and 0 (64).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 0 (88) and 4 (72).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 3 (90) and 2 (77).

Let's allocate based on these high valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (valued at 79) and item 5 (valued at 33, since itâ€™s the least desirable overall and gives agent 0 a second item without impacting others' high valuations).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (valued at 88) and item 4 (valued at 72).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (valued at 90) and item 2 (valued at 77).

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations.
