Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  79  28   6  37  47
1  61  86  66  78  72  28
2  82  79  89  52  21  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize each agent’s valuation, ensuring fairness by balancing total values received among agents.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 1 (79) and 5 (47).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 (86), 3 (78), and 4 (72).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 0 (82), 2 (89), and 3 (52).

To balance the allocations, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2

This distribution ensures that each agent gets items that they highly value, and each agent receives exactly 2 items.

Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
