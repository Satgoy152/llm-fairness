Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  23  26  61  64  60
1   7   7  60   7  12  22
2  72  96   6  14  78  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 0 the most, followed by item 4.
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 2 the most.
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 1 the most, followed by item 5.

Given these preferences and aiming for a fair allocation, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 5.

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items. The total number of items allocated is 6, which matches the requirement.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
