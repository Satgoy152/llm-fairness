Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  61   9  65  56  91
1  62  45  91  69   6  38
2  54   5  46  50   6  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 61  9 65 56 91]
 [62 45 91 69  6 38]
 [54  5 46 50  6 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 84
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 2: 9
   - Item 3: 65
   - Item 4: 56
   - Item 5: 91

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 62
   - Item 1: 45
   - Item 2: 91
   - Item 3: 69
   - Item 4: 6
   - Item 5: 38

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Item 0: 54
   - Item 1: 5
   - Item 2: 46
   - Item 3: 50
   - Item 4: 6
   - Item 5: 33

Now, we should assign the items by considering the highest valuations for each item and ensuring fairness:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 84.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 61.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 91.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it highest at 69.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 56.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest at 91.

However, if we allocate based only on highest value per item, Agent 2 may not receive any items. To ensure fairness, we can make a slight adjustment:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 5
2. Agent 1: Items 2, 3
3. Agent 2: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total valuation is relatively high.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
