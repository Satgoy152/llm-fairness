Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  21  58  89  82  87
1  44  10  65  29   4  85
2  37  25  47  82  52  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Evaluate the highest valued items for Agent 0. The highest values are 89 (item 3) and 87 (item 5). However, item 5 has the highest value for Agent 2, so we might need to adjust for overall fairness. 

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5 (85), so we try to allocate item 5 to Agent 1. The next highest value for Agent 1 is 65 (item 2).

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (92), so this item should go to Agent 2. However, to ensure fairness, we can give them items where they have the next highest values, like item 3 (82).

Considering these points, let's proceed with the allocation by maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as it has a high value (81).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for that agent and low value for others.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has a high value for that agent (even though Agent 0 values it highly too).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it adds significant value to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for Agent 2.

This allocation considers both maximizing the sum of the valuations for each agent and ensuring a fair distribution of items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their individual valuations of the items.
