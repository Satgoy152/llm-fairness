Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  64   8  94  95  22
1   3  79  10   2  64  61
2  21  98  17  15  16  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach for this is to try to give each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items valued highly by Agent 0 are items 3 and 4 (values 94 and 95 respectively).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items valued highly by Agent 1 are items 1 and 5 (values 79 and 61 respectively).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items valued highly by Agent 2 are items 0 and 2 (values 21 and 17 respectively).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 items, and the items are distributed based on the agents' preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
