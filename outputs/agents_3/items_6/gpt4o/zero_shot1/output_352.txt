Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  27  94   8  44  78
1  78  40   9  22  22  74
2  49  57  61  30  41  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the items with their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [(0, 89), (1, 27), (2, 94), (3, 8), (4, 44), (5, 78)]
   - Agent 1: [(0, 78), (1, 40), (2, 9), (3, 22), (4, 22), (5, 74)]
   - Agent 2: [(0, 49), (1, 57), (2, 61), (3, 30), (4, 41), (5, 91)]

2. **Sort each agent's valuations in descending order to see their preferences:**

   - Agent 0 prefers: 2, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3
   - Agent 1 prefers: 0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2
   - Agent 2 prefers: 5, 2, 1, 4, 3, 0

3. **Allocate items based on preferences while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:**

   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for an unallocated item).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for an unallocated item).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for an unallocated item).
   - Now, allocate item 1 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it higher than others.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it's next in their preference and is still available.
   - Finally, allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it's next in their preference and is available.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: [2, 4]
   - Agent 1: [0, 3]
   - Agent 2: [5, 1]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
