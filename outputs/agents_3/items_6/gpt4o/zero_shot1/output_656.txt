Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  76  20  33  39  59
1  32  39  87  32  40  36
2  61   7  21   6  10  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to maximize the total utility while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (76), and they also have relatively high valuations for item 5 (59). Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (87). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (61) and 5 (61). However, since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate item 0 to Agent 2. Additionally, Agent 2 can receive item 3 (6) and item 4 (10) as they have some value for these items.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4

This allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 6 items are distributed among the agents.
