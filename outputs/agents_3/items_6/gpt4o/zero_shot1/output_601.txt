Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  35  10  95  36  98
1  51  83  89   9  77  96
2   3  48  54  70  65  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the total value of items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here’s one possible way to do this:

1. Review the highest valuations and allocate those items first, ensuring each agent receives items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 44, 35, 10, 95, 36, 98
- Agent 1: 51, 83, 89, 9, 77, 96
- Agent 2: 3, 48, 54, 70, 65, 38

### Allocation Strategy:
- Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent to ensure fairness.
- Allocate remaining items to balance the total value received by each agent.

### Allocation Plan:
1. Agent 0 highly values item 5 (value 98), allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 89), allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (value 70), allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, two items are allocated to each agent. Let's allocate the remaining items:

4. Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (value 44).
5. Agent 1: Allocate item 1 (value 83).
6. Agent 2: Allocate item 4 (value 65).

Each agent now has two items, and all items are allocated. Here’s the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
