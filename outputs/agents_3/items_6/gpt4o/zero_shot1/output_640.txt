Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  69  51  44  89  96
1  85  88  69   8  80  60
2   6  25  38  42  87  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 88 69  8 80 60]
 [ 6 25 38 42 87 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following allocations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 5 (value 96)
   - Item 4 (value 89)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 0 (value 85)
   - Item 1 (value 88)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 2 (value 38)
   - Item 3 (value 42)

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensures every agent gets items.

Now, let's present this allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
