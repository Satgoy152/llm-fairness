Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  49  50   0  41  14
1  67   5  41  62  81  18
2  30  38  61  23  56  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [58, 49, 50, 0, 41, 14]
- Agent 1: [67, 5, 41, 62, 81, 18]
- Agent 2: [30, 38, 61, 23, 56, 66]

A simple greedy approach is to allocate the highest valued items to each agent one by one and then review the distribution to ensure fairness (each agent gets at least one item if possible).

1. Start by listing the highest value available for each agent and allocate those items first.
2. Keep distributing the highest remaining valued items to agents until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (58).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (81).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (66).

After allocating these items, the remaining items are 1, 2, 3. Let's continue allocating:

- Agent 0 now values item 2 the next most (50).
- Agent 1 now values item 3 the next most (62).
- Agent 2 now values item 1 the next most (38).

Now each agent has received 2 items:

- Agent 0: items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: items 4 and 3
- Agent 2: items 5 and 1

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
