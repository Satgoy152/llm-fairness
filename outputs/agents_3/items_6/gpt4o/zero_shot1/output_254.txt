Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  77  18   4  30  58
1  24  73  48  11  77  80
2  30  52   9  65  33  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Maximize their value by assigning items with the highest values. Items 0 and 1 have high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 1, followed by item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 2 have relatively higher values for Agent 2 compared to the other agents.

Allocations:
- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1** gets items [4, 5]
- **Agent 2** gets items [2, 3]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
