Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  32  87   6  15  74
1  54  29  45  17  46  45
2  15  57  81  99  94   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. To achieve this, we can use a method based on maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent can potentially receive by evaluating all possible item combinations.
2. Assign items to agents in a manner that attempts to maximize their individual valuations.
3. Ensure no two agents receive the same item, and all items are distributed.

Based on the given valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 3, 4, and 1.

Allocating based on these observations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 4]

Now, I will present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
