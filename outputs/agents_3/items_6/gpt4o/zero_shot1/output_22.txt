Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41   8  35  34   4  26
1  66   5  58  46  54  80
2  92  55  22  19  70  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 55 22 19 70 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One heuristic approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation preference for each agent in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is item 0 with 41, item 2 with 35, and item 3 with 34.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is item 5 with 80, item 0 with 66, and item 2 with 58.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is item 0 with 92, item 4 with 70, and item 1 with 55.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Valuations are [41, 66, 92]. Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
2. **Item 1**: Valuations are [8, 5, 55]. Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
3. **Item 2**: Valuations are [35, 58, 22]. Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
4. **Item 3**: Valuations are [34, 46, 19]. Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
5. **Item 4**: Valuations are [4, 54, 70]. Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
6. **Item 5**: Valuations are [26, 80, 36]. Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

After the allocation, let's check the items each agent gets:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 4

Now, presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
