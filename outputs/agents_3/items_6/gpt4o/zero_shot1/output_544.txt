Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  63  22   6  21  80
1   6  14  48   9  98  57
2  76  25  35  55  20  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's an allocation strategy that aims to balance the allocations based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most and item 1 second most. 
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 2 highly values item 0.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets at least one item where possible:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (reasonable value for Agent 1, less contested).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (reasonable value for Agent 2, less contested).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
