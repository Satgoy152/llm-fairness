Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  88  22  98  47  77
1  12  28  27   1   2   8
2  15  99  66  16  39  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 28 27  1  2  8]
 [15 99 66 16 39 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each receives an integer number of items. We have 3 agents and 6 items, so each agent should get 2 items if we want to allocate all items equally. Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 5 (Values: 98 and 77, Total: 175)
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2 (Values: 12 and 27, Total: 39)
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 4 (Values: 99 and 39, Total: 138)

This allocation gives each agent two items, and all items are allocated. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
