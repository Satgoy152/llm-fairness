Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  83  59  25  39  89
1  27  22  47  39   3  79
2  15  23  14  42  74  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation using a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Assign items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

2. Review the overall allocation to ensure fairness in terms of total value received by each agent.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 has a particularly high valuation for item 5, but since agent 0 values item 5 even more, we might need to adjust based on remaining items.
- Agent 2 values item 4 significantly, which is unique compared to other agents.

Given these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

This allocation results in the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 63 (item 0) + 83 (item 1) = 146
- Agent 1: 39 (item 3) + 79 (item 5) = 118
- Agent 2: 59 (item 2) + 74 (item 4) = 133

The allocations balance the total value each agent receives as closely as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
