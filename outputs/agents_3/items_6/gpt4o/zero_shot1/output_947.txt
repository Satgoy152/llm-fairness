Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  41  81  98   1  93
1  98  95  51  85  42  15
2  20  11   6  29  18  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 41 81 98  1 93]
 [98 95 51 85 42 15]
 [20 11  6 29 18 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations each agent receives. Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [39, 41, 81, 98, 1, 93]
- Agent 1's valuations: [98, 95, 51, 85, 42, 15]
- Agent 2's valuations: [20, 11, 6, 29, 18, 21]

We can proceed by assigning the items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

1. Start by assigning the highest value item for each agent:
   - Item 3 (value 98) to Agent 0
   - Item 0 (value 98) to Agent 1
   - Item 5 (value 21) to Agent 2

2. Continue assigning items based on the next highest values:
   - Item 2 (value 81) to Agent 0
   - Item 1 (value 95) to Agent 1
   - Item 4 (value 18) to Agent 2

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
