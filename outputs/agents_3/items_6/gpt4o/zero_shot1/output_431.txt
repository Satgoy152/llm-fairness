Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  30  41  43  38  84
1  22  97  50  61  69  69
2  10  90  11  24  60  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total satisfaction or utility of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign items to the agent who values them the most at each step.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - Assign to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 97
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - Assign to Agent 1

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41
   - Agent 1 values it at 50
   - Agent 2 values it at 11
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43
   - Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Assign to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Agent 2 values it at 60
   - Assign to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Agent 2 values it at 88
   - Assign to Agent 2

In this allocation, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring each item is assigned to one agent. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```

Agent 0 receives item 0.  
Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
Agent 2 receives item 5.  

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
