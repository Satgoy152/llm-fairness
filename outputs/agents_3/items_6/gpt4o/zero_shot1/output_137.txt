Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  21  42  96   5  34
1  54   8  63  25  52  30
2  30  37  18  91  74  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the constraints, we'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (value 96)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (value 69)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (value 63)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (value 54) - already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 4 (value 52)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (value 74) - already taken by Agent 1
   - Next highest: Item 3 (value 91) - already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 5 (value 37)

Now let's look at the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 0]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 1]

Each agent receives two items, totaling 6 items allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
