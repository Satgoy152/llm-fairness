Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  90  90  82  55  89
1   2  91   2  56  92   9
2  44  44  32  11  76  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 90 90 82 55 89]
 [ 2 91  2 56 92  9]
 [44 44 32 11 76 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to maximize overall satisfaction by distributing the items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's analyze the given valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  90  90  82  55  89
1   2  91   2  56  92   9
2  44  44  32  11  76  78
```

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. To maximize their satisfaction, allocate items with their highest value:
   - Allocate item 1 (value 90).
   - Allocate item 5 (value 89).

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 and 4, but item 1 is already allocated. Allocate based on remaining high value:
   - Allocate item 4 (value 92).
   - Allocate item 3 (value 56).

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has moderate valuations. Allocate items not yet allocated:
   - Allocate item 0 (value 44).
   - Allocate item 2 (value 32).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, while all items are distributed among the three agents.
