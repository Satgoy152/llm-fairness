Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  69  67  12  80  69
1  66  40  28  96  22  17
2  59  57  42  30  42  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Agent 0** seems to highly value item 0 (95) and item 4 (80).
2. **Agent 1** has a strong preference for item 3 (96).
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 (78) the most.

Now to distribute the remaining items fairly:

- Agent 0 also highly values item 1 (69) and item 2 (67).
- Agent 1 can take item 2 since Agent 0 already has item 0 and item 1 which they value highly.
- Agent 2 can take item 1 as they value it reasonably (57) and it's not the top preference for Agent 1.

Given these considerations, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
