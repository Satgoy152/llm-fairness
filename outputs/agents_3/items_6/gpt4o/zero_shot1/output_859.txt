Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  44  52  29  90  56
1  25  83  21   9  56  35
2  83   2  78  16  86  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 83 21  9 56 35]
 [83  2 78 16 86 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can use a simple heuristic approach where we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [59, 44, 52, 29, 90, 56]
- Agent 1 values: [25, 83, 21,  9, 56, 35]
- Agent 2 values: [83,  2, 78, 16, 86, 17]

One approach is to assign items based on the highest value each agent has for any unallocated item at each step.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 0 (90), so assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 2 (83), so assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 1 (83), so assign it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2** is the next highest value for Agent 2 (78), so assign it to Agent 2.
5. **Item 5** is the next highest value for Agent 0 (56), so assign it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 3** can be assigned to Agent 0 who values it at (29).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences.
