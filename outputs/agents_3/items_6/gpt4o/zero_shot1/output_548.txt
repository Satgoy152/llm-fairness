Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  24  95  66  93  39
1  16  54  48   7  99  22
2   5  22  17  61  72  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 24 95 66 93 39]
 [16 54 48  7 99 22]
 [ 5 22 17 61 72 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The valuations are as follows:
- Agent 0: [92, 24, 95, 66, 93, 39]
- Agent 1: [16, 54, 48, 7, 99, 22]
- Agent 2: [5, 22, 17, 61, 72, 48]

A straightforward approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, which is the highest.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 54, which is the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95, which is the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 61, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is the highest.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 48, which is the highest.

Based on these valuations, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 4]
- Agent 2 receives items [3, 5]

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
