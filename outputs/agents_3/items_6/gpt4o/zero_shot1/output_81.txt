Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  92  87  87   1   1
1  70  94  11  50  16  50
2  19  22  52  89  21  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 92 87 87  1  1]
 [70 94 11 50 16 50]
 [19 22 52 89 21 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 2, and 5.

We need to balance these preferences, ensuring all items are allocated and trying to maximize each agent's total valuation.

A reasonable allocation is:
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receiving a total valuation of 147 (55 + 92).
- Agent 1 receiving a total valuation of 66 (50 + 16).
- Agent 2 receiving a total valuation of 135 (52 + 83).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
