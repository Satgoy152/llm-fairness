Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  30  13  21   0  86
1  74  65  12  55  48  85
2  91  19  99  46  35  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 65 12 55 48 85]
 [91 19 99 46 35 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that considers maximizing the total valuation each agent gets.

First, let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [51, 30, 13, 21, 0, 86]
- Agent 1: [74, 65, 12, 55, 48, 85]
- Agent 2: [91, 19, 99, 46, 35, 75]

A potential approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Let's allocate one item to each agent based on their maximum value, then proceed with the remaining items.

1. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 2 (99), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 5 (86), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (65), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, and 5. The remaining items are 0, 3, and 4.

4. Among the remaining items, **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 0 (91), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
5. The next highest valuation for the remaining items is for **Agent 1** on item 3 (55), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
6. Finally, **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4 (48) among the remaining choices, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 0]

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
