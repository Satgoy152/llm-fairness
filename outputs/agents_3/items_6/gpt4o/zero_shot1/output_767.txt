Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  72  23  99   2  96
1  39  56  99   6  73  86
2  90  12  40  33  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 56 99  6 73 86]
 [90 12 40 33 97  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items proportional to their valuations or in a manner that maximizes their total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  72  23  99   2  96
1  39  56  99   6  73  86
2  90  12  40  33  97   7
```

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences.

2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

3. Balance the allocation by maximizing the total value each agent receives, considering the remaining unassigned items.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value is 99 for item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value is 99 for item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: The highest value is 97 for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now we have:

- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has item 4.

Remaining items are 0, 1, and 5.

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 since their next highest value is 96 for item 5.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since their next highest value is 56 for item 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since their next highest value is 90 for item 0.

This yields the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
