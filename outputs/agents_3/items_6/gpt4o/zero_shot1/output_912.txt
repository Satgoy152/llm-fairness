Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  93  37  98  87  92
1  57  32  16  31   3  11
2  71  42  89  19  49  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we will use a simple heuristic to ensure a fair distribution of items based on valuations, attempting to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Let's go through the valuations and distribute the items:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- 0: 9  
- 1: 93  
- 2: 37  
- 3: 98  
- 4: 87  
- 5: 92  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- 0: 57  
- 1: 32  
- 2: 16  
- 3: 31  
- 4: 3  
- 5: 11  

Agent 2's valuations:  
- 0: 71  
- 1: 42  
- 2: 89  
- 3: 19  
- 4: 49  
- 5: 59  

Now let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 3** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (98). Assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (71). Assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (89). Assign it to Agent 2.
4. **Item 1** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (93). Assign it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 5** has a decent valuation for Agent 0 (92). Assign it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 4** has a decent valuation for Agent 2 (49). Assign it to Agent 2.

Now, all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
``` 

This distribution aims to balance the overall value received by each agent based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. Agent 1 unfortunately does not receive any items based on this allocation, since their valuations were generally lower for the items compared to the other agents.
