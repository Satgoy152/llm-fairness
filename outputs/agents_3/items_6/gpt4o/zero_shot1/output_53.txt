Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  51  37  38  80  43
1   1  66   8  25  66  24
2  14  45  95  88  93  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0 and 4 (both valued at 80), so it makes sense to allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (valued at 66). They also value item 4 equally (66), but since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 2, 3, and 4. However, item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0. Therefore, we allocate items 2 (valued at 95) and 3 (valued at 88) to Agent 2.

Finally, we need to allocate item 5. Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 at 24, and Agent 2 at 18. Since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item, we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
