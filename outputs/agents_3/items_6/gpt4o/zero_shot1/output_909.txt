Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  54  83  20  62  70
1  42  51  29  61  24  17
2  22  96  96  42  73  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 51 29 61 24 17]
 [22 96 96 42 73 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We have to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and note potential high-value allocations.
2. Try to balance the number of items each agent receives while maximizing the value.

Based on the table:

- Agent 0 values: [38, 54, 83, 20, 62, 70]
- Agent 1 values: [42, 51, 29, 61, 24, 17]
- Agent 2 values: [22, 96, 96, 42, 73, 42]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 2 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 3.
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 1 and 2.

One possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

This allocation provides a fair distribution while ensuring each agent receives valuable items according to their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
