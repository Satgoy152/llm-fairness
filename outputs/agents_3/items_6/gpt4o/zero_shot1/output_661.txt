Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  70  87  62  16  39
1  88  40  27  66  60  59
2  22  53  87  69  37  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a heuristic approach to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. One way to do this is to consider maximizing the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's try to allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items for agent 0 are items 2 and 0 (87 and 80). Assign item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item for agent 1 is item 0 (88). Assign item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item for agent 2 is item 2, but itâ€™s already taken. Next highest is item 3 (69). Assign item 3 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has at least one item. Let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Remaining items are 1, 4, 5.**

5. **Agent 0**: Highest remaining value is item 1 (70). Assign item 1 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 1**: Highest remaining value is item 4 (60). Assign item 4 to agent 1.

7. **Agent 2**: Only remaining item is item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 2.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
