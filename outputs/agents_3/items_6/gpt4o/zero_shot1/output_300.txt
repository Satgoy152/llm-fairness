Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  95  72  71  46  35
1   1  54  25  36  80  88
2  22  79  78  71  99  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 54 25 36 80 88]
 [22 79 78 71 99 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 6 items allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (11), Agent 1 (1), Agent 2 (22)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (95), Agent 1 (54), Agent 2 (79)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (72), Agent 1 (25), Agent 2 (78)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (71), Agent 1 (36), Agent 2 (71)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (46), Agent 1 (80), Agent 2 (99)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (35), Agent 1 (88), Agent 2 (69)

To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

One possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 and item 2 (total valuation: 95 + 72 = 167)
- Agent 1 gets item 4 and item 5 (total valuation: 80 + 88 = 168)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 and item 3 (total valuation: 22 + 71 = 93)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all 6 items are distributed.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
