Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  10  21  52  27  40
1  47  94  81  44  59  21
2  31   2  23  37  71  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent derives from the items they receive. We'll consider each agent's valuation and try to distribute the items in a way that offers a balanced allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 0 (98).
- Agent 1 has high values for items 1 (94) and 2 (81).
- Agent 2 has high values for items 5 (89) and 4 (71).

Considering these preferences, a reasonable allocation can be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it offers them the highest value.
2. Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1, as these provide the highest value for them.
3. Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 2, based on their high valuation for these items.
4. The remaining item, 3, can be allocated to Agent 0 or 1, as both have moderate valuations for it. We'll give it to Agent 0 since Agent 1 already has two items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
