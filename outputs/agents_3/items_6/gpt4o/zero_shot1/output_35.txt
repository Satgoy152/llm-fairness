Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  59  58  26  59  10
1   3  37  80  52   6  63
2  23  76  49  11  29  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [23 76 49 11 29 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Continue to allocate remaining items based on the next highest valuation for each agent.

Following this strategy, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (59).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (80).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (76), but item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we move to their next highest item, which is item 5 (47).

Now let's continue:

- Agent 0 has item 1, next highest is item 4 (59).
- Agent 1 has item 2, next highest is item 5, but it's already allocated, so next is item 3 (52).
- Agent 2 has item 5, next highest is item 0 (23).

At this point, each agent has been allocated two items. Now we have:

Agent 0: Items 1 and 4  
Agent 1: Items 2 and 3  
Agent 2: Items 5 and 0  

This allocation assigns all six items and maximizes the total satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```
