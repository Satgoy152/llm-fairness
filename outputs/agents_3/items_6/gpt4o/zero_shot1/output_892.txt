Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  52  60  18  21  15
1   7   6  92  84  96  35
2  38  34  35  99  19  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items based on highest preferences:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (60), 2 (60), and 1 (52).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 4 (96), 2 (92), and 3 (84).

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 3 (99), 5 (54), and 0 (38).

A possible allocation strategy could be to maximize the total value each agent receives by giving preference to their highest valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's consider the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items 0, 1

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items 2, 4 

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items 3, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 items each. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
