Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  28   0   5  61  88
1  35  11   9  78  77  78
2  69  11  19  99  14  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Values for items: [39, 28, 0, 5, 61, 88]
2. **Agent 1**: Values for items: [35, 11, 9, 78, 77, 78]
3. **Agent 2**: Values for items: [69, 11, 19, 99, 14, 13]

To allocate fairly, we can try to distribute the items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 has the highest value (69)
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 has the highest value (28)
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest value (19)
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 has the highest value (99)
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 has the highest value (61)
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 has the highest value (88)

To balance the number of items each agent receives, we can adjust as follows:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 2
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 2

This way, each agent gets two items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving two items.
