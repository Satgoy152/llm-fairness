Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  68  58  97  34  48
1   3  91  76  72   4  85
2  11  49  92  30   8  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 91 76 72  4 85]
 [11 49 92 30  8 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Items: 0 (31), 1 (68), 2 (58), 3 (97), 4 (34), 5 (48)

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Items: 0 (3), 1 (91), 2 (76), 3 (72), 4 (4), 5 (85)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - Items: 0 (11), 1 (49), 2 (92), 3 (30), 4 (8), 5 (19)

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Item 3** has the highest value (97) for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** has the highest value (91) for Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 1.
- **Item 2** has the highest value (92) for Agent 2, so allocate it to Agent 2.
- **Item 5** has a high value (85) for Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 1.
- **Item 0** has a higher value (31) for Agent 0 compared to others.
- **Item 4** has a low value for all, but Agent 0 can take it (34) as it complements their allocation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all six items.
