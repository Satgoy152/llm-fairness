Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  62  53  94  31  32
1  18  66   2  50  55  22
2  48  76  17  73  26  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, we also need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item to maintain fairness in distribution. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
- Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it the most (value 94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the most (value 76).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the most (value 98).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it highly (value 88).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the most (value 55).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it higher than agent 2.

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and items are allocated based on the highest valuations possible under these constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of distributing all 6 items fairly among the 3 agents.
