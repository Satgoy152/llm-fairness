Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  70  39  20  97  97
1  88  88  89  19  51   9
2  23  70   0  25  90  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 88 89 19 51  9]
 [23 70  0 25 90 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll look for an allocation where each agent gets two items, as there are three agents and six items in total.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest valuations are for items 4 and 5 (97 each).

- Agent 1:
  - Highest valuations are for items 0 (88) and 2 (89).

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valuations are for items 4 and 5 (90 and 95, respectively).

We'll try to allocate based on maximizing these preferences while ensuring that each agent gets two items. Here's a potential allocation:

- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 0, as they highly value these items.
- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 1, as they have high valuations for these.
- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 2, which gives them items that were not the highest for others.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and maximizes overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
