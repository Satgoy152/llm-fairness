Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  23  36   5  77  82
1  28  64   6  99  77  87
2  66  99  87  34  80  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction for all agents. Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent gets items that they value highly.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 5 the highest (82), followed by item 4 (77).
   - Allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 3 the highest (99).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 1 the highest (99), followed by item 2 (87).
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining item**: 
   - Item 0 is left, and Agent 2 values it the highest (66).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly and fairly distributes all items.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
