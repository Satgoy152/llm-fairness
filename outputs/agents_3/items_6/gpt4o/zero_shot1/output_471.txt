Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  31  56  79  44  23
1  61  87  34  59  98  72
2  53  91  46  67  37  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 87 34 59 98 72]
 [53 91 46 67 37 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to assign items to agents such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  31  56  79  44  23
1  61  87  34  59  98  72
2  53  91  46  67  37  99
```

We want to allocate the items so that the total valuation each agent receives is fairly distributed.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 2 highly values items 5 and 1.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating items with the highest unique valuations to each agent to maximize their total satisfaction.
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 72).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 91).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 79).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 98).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 99).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 34).

This allocation attempts to balance total valuations across agents as much as possible while ensuring an integer number of items for each agent.

### Allocation Result:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 6.
