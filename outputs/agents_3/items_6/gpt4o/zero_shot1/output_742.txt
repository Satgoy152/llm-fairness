Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  23  43  18  76  86
1  84  51  25  66  73  71
2  94  20  91  47  77  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to distribute the items to balance the total value among agents.
2. Consider preferences and try to give higher-valued items to the agents who value them more, while keeping the total distribution fair.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values are [6, 23, 43, 18, 76, 86]. Highest values are items 5 (86) and 4 (76).
- **Agent 1**: Values are [84, 51, 25, 66, 73, 71]. Highest values are items 0 (84), 3 (66), and 4 (73).
- **Agent 2**: Values are [94, 20, 91, 47, 77, 26]. Highest values are items 0 (94), 2 (91), and 4 (77).

Considering these preferences, here's a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5 (86) and 1 (23).
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (84) and 3 (66).
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 (91) and 4 (77).

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and distributes the items fairly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
