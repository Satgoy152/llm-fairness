Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  42  62  80  44  90
1   7   4  47  69  90  83
2  49  10  89  24  29  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share. Given the constraints and the table of valuations, we can proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to balance the values each agent receives.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (90), Item 3 (80)
   - Allocate items 5, 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 5 (83)
   - Item 5 is already allocated, so assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 0 (49)
   - Allocate items 2, 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 is left. The highest valuation for Item 1 is from Agent 0 (42), but Agent 0 already has 2 items. We could allocate it to Agent 2, who has a fair valuation for Item 1 (10).

So, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation provides a balance based on the highest valuations and ensures that each agent receives items.
