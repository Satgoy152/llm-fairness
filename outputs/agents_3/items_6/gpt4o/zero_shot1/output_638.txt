Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  62   4   3  84  78
1  41  46  94  16  39  45
2  12  23  77  75  30  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 23 77 75 30 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate items such that agents receive a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's review the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [1, 62, 4, 3, 84, 78]
- Agent 1 values: [41, 46, 94, 16, 39, 45]
- Agent 2 values: [12, 23, 77, 75, 30, 70]

We'll try to make allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction by focusing on their highest valued items while ensuring a fair distribution.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Highly values items 4 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values items 2 and 3, but given that agent 1 highly values item 2 more, we'll consider agent 2's next highest valued item.

Given these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4 and 5 (values 84 and 78)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value 94)
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 3 (values 23 and 75)

Now, there are two items remaining: 0 and another one to balance allocations. We will distribute these last items considering remaining values:
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 41)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 23)

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while ensuring all items are allocated.
