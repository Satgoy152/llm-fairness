Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  25  40  13  73  37
1  95   4  21  34   5  56
2  81  10  98  94  36  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets items they value highly, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the highest values:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 0 (77), 4 (73).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 0 (95), 5 (56).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 2 (98), 5 (99).

Now considering the allocations to ensure fairness:
- Agent 0 can be allocated items they value highly like 1 (25) and 4 (73).
- Agent 1 can be allocated item 0 (95) and item 3 (34), which balances their high value for item 0.
- Agent 2 can be allocated items 2 (98) and 5 (99), which they value very highly.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
