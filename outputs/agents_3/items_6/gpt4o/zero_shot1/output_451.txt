Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  49  34  23  21  10
1  60  65  61   5   3  79
2  53  91  99  97  73   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 65 61  5  3 79]
 [53 91 99 97 73  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [16, 49, 34, 23, 21, 10]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [60, 65, 61, 5, 3, 79]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [53, 91, 99, 97, 73, 4]

A possible fair allocation is to try to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences. We first rank the items for each agent based on their individual valuations and then try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuations for items, especially items 2, 3, and 1.
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 2 (valuations: 99 and 97).

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5, 1, and 0.
   - Allocate items 5 and 1 to Agent 1 (valuations: 79 and 65).

3. **Agent 0** has items with relatively lower valuations, but we need to ensure they receive a fair share.
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0 (valuations: 16 and 21).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share in terms of quantity and their higher-valued preferences are considered.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the agents, with each receiving an integer number of items.
