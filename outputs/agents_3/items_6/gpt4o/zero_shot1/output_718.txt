Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  55  95  24  72  78
1  94  68  56  19   0  96
2  22   5  70  59  14  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations table and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item and assign it accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 94
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (94 is the highest)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 68
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (68 is the highest)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 95
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 70
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (95 is the highest)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 24
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - **Assign to Agent 2** (59 is the highest)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 0
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - **Assign to Agent 0** (72 is the highest)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 10
   - **Assign to Agent 1** (96 is the highest)

Now we compile the allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items that they value the most while all items are allocated.
