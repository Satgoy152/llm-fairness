Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  27  81  94  71  89
1  94  87  88  24  44  55
2  24  87  69  82  23  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all six items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items that maximize their value sum while considering other agents.
- Agent 1: Similarly, assign items that maximize their value sum.
- Agent 2: Allocate the remaining items in a way that maximizes their value.

After examining the values and ensuring each agent gets a reasonable distribution, the following allocation can be made:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 3
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1
- Agent 2 gets items 4, 5

Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives items and all items are allocated.
