Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  86  13  37  39  74
1  40  18   5  58  63  46
2  34   0  60  34  20  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieving this:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Start by looking at the highest values each agent assigns to items, and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (86). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (63). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 highly (82). Assign item 5 to agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Consider remaining items (0, 2, 3) and distribute them by considering the next highest valuations and balancing the number of items each agent gets.

4. **Balancing the Allocation**:
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 40 for agent 1).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 60 for agent 2).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 37 for agent 0).

Now, each agent has received two items and the allocations can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value significantly, aiming for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
