Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  76  39  33  89  53
1  58  97  98  81  29  82
2  28  53  91  41  81  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 97 98 81 29 82]
 [28 53 91 41 81 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. We can use a simple approach by assigning items based on the highest valuations of each agent. Let's examine the valuations and make an allocation:

Agent 0:
- Values: [56, 76, 39, 33, 89, 53]

Agent 1:
- Values: [58, 97, 98, 81, 29, 82]

Agent 2:
- Values: [28, 53, 91, 41, 81, 90]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Assign the highest value item for each agent first**, then distribute the remaining items considering fairness and maximizing individual agent values.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest value is 89 for item 4.
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest value is 98 for item 2.
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest value is 91 for item 2, but item 2 is already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is 90 for item 5.

After assigning the highest values:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]

#### Distribute Remaining Items:
- Remaining items: [0, 1, 3]

1. **Assign item 1** (highest remaining value):
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (97) for item 1.
   - Allocation: Agent 1 gets item 1.

2. **Assign item 0**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (58) for item 0, but Agent 0 could benefit as well. To ensure fairness, Agent 0 receives item 0.
   - Allocation: Agent 0 gets item 0.

3. **Assign item 3**:
   - Remaining options: Agent 0 (33), Agent 1 (81), Agent 2 (41).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation (81) for item 3.
   - Allocation: Agent 1 gets item 3.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: [5]

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while distributing the items fairly among them.
