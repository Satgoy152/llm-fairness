Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  39  39  91  93  42
1  78  94  33   1  66  31
2  86  19   4  82  61  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (93), Item 3 (91)
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 0 (78)
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (86), Item 5 (77)

Now, let's allocate the items by attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0 gets:** Item 4 (93) and Item 3 (91)
- **Agent 1 gets:** Item 1 (94) and Item 0 (78)
- **Agent 2 gets:** Item 2 (4) and Item 5 (77)

This allocation respects the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
