Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  44  69  89  19  57
1  59  14  86   3  76  90
2  10   6  34  51  75  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 14 86  3 76 90]
 [10  6 34 51 75 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 0, 3, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 5 and item 2.
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high value for item 4 and moderate values for item 3.

To balance the distribution, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign item 0 and 3 to Agent 0 since they have high values for these items.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since they have the highest value for it.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since they have a high value for it.
- To distribute the remaining items fairly:
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as they value it more than others.
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 2 to balance the number of items.

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total value each agent receives, given their preferences.
