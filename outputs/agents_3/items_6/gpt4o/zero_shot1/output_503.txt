Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  83  83  28  92  57
1  48   4  53  58  65  95
2  28  75  94   1  42  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Let's examine the table and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized for them while also trying to balance the distribution.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items: 4 (value 92), 1 (value 83), 2 (value 83)
   - Allocate items 4 and 1 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value items: 5 (value 95), 3 (value 58), 4 (value 65)
   - Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value items: 2 (value 94), 1 (value 75), 4 (value 42)
   - Allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 2

Now, let's verify:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 1 (Total valuation: 175)
- Agent 1: Items 5, 3 (Total valuation: 153)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 0 (Total valuation: 122)

Each agent receives a different number of items, but this allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations for the items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
