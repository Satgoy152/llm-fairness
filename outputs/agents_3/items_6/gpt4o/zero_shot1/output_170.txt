Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  34  35  60  73  73
1  91  98  85  26  28  38
2  87  92  19  28  45  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 34 35 60 73 73]
 [91 98 85 26 28 38]
 [87 92 19 28 45 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their valuations. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Look at the table and identify which items have the highest valuations for each agent.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents Based on Highest Valuations:** Start by allocating items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each item is only assigned once, and each agent gets approximately an equal number of items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible across the agents.

Here is one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 0 (72) and 4 (73).
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 1 (98) and 2 (85).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 5 (56) and 3 (28).

Thus, each agent receives two items, and the allocation is balanced.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
