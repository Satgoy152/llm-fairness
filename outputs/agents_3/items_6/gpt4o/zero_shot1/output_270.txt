Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  80  79  85  62  73
1  91  40  17  58  14  45
2  82  54  23  42  66   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives an equitable share based on their preferences. Given that each agent should ideally receive around 2 items (since there are 6 items and 3 agents), we can allocate the items to balance fairness and preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: [16, 80, 79, 85, 62, 73]
- Agent 1 values items: [91, 40, 17, 58, 14, 45]
- Agent 2 values items: [82, 54, 23, 42, 66, 4]

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first, if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets approximately 2 items.

Following this method, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (85) and item 1 (80).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (91) and item 3 (58); however, item 3 is already taken, so we choose item 5 (45) as the next highest.
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (82) which is already taken, so we select item 4 (66) and item 1 (54); however, item 1 is taken, so we opt for item 2 (23).

Thus, the allocation strategy is:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 4, 2

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
