Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  70  90  26  20  57
1  45  88  51  52  40  63
2  83  83  97   7  70  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 88 51 52 40 63]
 [83 83 97  7 70 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the fairness based on the valuations given, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will try to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's evaluate the situation:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: [5, 70, 90, 26, 20, 57]
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: [45, 88, 51, 52, 40, 63]
3. **Agent 2's valuations**: [83, 83, 97, 7, 70, 36]

Given that we are allocating 6 items among 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest valued items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (90)
   - Second highest value item: Item 1 (70)
   - Allocate items 2 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (88) already taken by Agent 0.
   - Second highest value item: Item 5 (63)
   - Third highest value item: Item 3 (52)
   - Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (97) already taken by Agent 0.
   - Second highest value item: Item 0 (83)
   - Third highest value item: Item 4 (70)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, maximizing their individual valuations based on the constraints given.
