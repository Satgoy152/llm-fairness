Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0   5  63  52  36  63
1   7  61  73  12  20  26
2  18  65  54  39  93  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 61 73 12 20 26]
 [18 65 54 39 93 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. We will do this by considering the valuations provided for each item by each agent and distributing the items to maximize the satisfaction across all agents.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [0, 5, 63, 52, 36, 63]
- Agent 1: [7, 61, 73, 12, 20, 26]
- Agent 2: [18, 65, 54, 39, 93, 39]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

#### Item by Item Analysis:
- **Item 0**:
  - Agent 0 values at 0
  - Agent 1 values at 7
  - Agent 2 values at 18 (Highest)
  - Allocate to Agent 2

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values at 5
  - Agent 1 values at 61 (Highest)
  - Agent 2 values at 65
  - Allocate to Agent 2

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0 values at 63 (Highest)
  - Agent 1 values at 73
  - Agent 2 values at 54
  - Allocate to Agent 1

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values at 52 (Highest)
  - Agent 1 values at 12
  - Agent 2 values at 39
  - Allocate to Agent 0

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values at 36
  - Agent 1 values at 20
  - Agent 2 values at 93 (Highest)
  - Allocate to Agent 2

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0 values at 63
  - Agent 1 values at 26
  - Agent 2 values at 39 (Highest)
  - Allocate to Agent 0

### Allocation:
Based on the above analysis, the items can be allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total value is maximized for each agent according to their preferences, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
