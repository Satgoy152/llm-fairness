Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  16  80   0  32  40
1  50  69  96  13  90  14
2  85   2  25  55  10  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 16 80  0 32 40]
 [50 69 96 13 90 14]
 [85  2 25 55 10 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. The goal is to ensure that all items are allocated while trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [29, 16, 80, 0, 32, 40]
- Agent 1: [50, 69, 96, 13, 90, 14]
- Agent 2: [85, 2, 25, 55, 10, 73]

We will allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, but also ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest at 85.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it highest at 69.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 96.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 55.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 90.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest at 73.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 currently has no items. We can reallocate item 4 (valued at 32 by Agent 0 and 90 by Agent 1) to Agent 0 to ensure fairness, although it's not optimal. To balance the allocation, we can try reallocating item 3 from Agent 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 0 by Agent 0 and 55 by Agent 2) as Agent 0 values it least, but this might not be practical. Instead, let's find a reasonable balance:

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (valued at 32)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2 (valued at 69, 96)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 5 (valued at 85, 55, 73)

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
