Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  28  29  82  17  51
1  94  40  66  16  49  57
2  78  78  87  41  69  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 78 87 41 69 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's satisfaction is maximized. Here, "fair" could mean maximizing the total valuation for each agent or ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal share of the total value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 29
- Item 1: 28
- Item 2: 29
- Item 3: 82
- Item 4: 17
- Item 5: 51

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 94
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 66
- Item 3: 16
- Item 4: 49
- Item 5: 57

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 78
- Item 1: 78
- Item 2: 87
- Item 3: 41
- Item 4: 69
- Item 5: 11

Let's consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (82). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (94). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (87). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, consider the remaining items [1, 4, 5] to be allocated.

4. **Agent 2** also values item 1 highly (78), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 1** values item 5 (57) next after item 0, so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** values item 4 (17) better than the remaining options, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets two items, and the sum of valuations per agent is reasonably balanced given the input.
