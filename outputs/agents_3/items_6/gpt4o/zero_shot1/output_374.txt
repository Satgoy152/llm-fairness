Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  97  85  72  43  38
1  65  36  96  85  51  28
2  44  75  21  12  34  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We should also try to balance the total valuations so that no agent gets significantly less than the others. Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (97). Next highest is item 2 (85), then item 0 (66).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (96). Next highest is item 3 (85), then item 0 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (75). Next highest is item 0 (44), then items 4 and 5 (34 and 44).

We can map out some possible allocations and their respective valuations:

- If we assign:
  - Agent 0: items 0 and 1
  - Agent 1: items 2 and 3
  - Agent 2: items 4 and 5

We ensure that each agent receives two items, and the total valuation for each agent is somewhat balanced:

- Agent 0 gets: 66 (item 0) + 97 (item 1) = 163
- Agent 1 gets: 96 (item 2) + 85 (item 3) = 181
- Agent 2 gets: 34 (item 4) + 44 (item 5) = 78

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value reasonably well, considering the constraints.

Given this allocation, the JSON representation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
