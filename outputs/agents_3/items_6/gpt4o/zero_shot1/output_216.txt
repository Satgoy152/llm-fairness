Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  43  85  69  25  99
1  99  39   4  81  28  69
2  44  97   5  10  51  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 39  4 81 28 69]
 [44 97  5 10 51 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by ensuring that each agent's overall valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value across agents is reasonably balanced.

Let's evaluate the most optimal allocation using the provided data:

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
-------------|------------------------
0            | 51  43  85  69  25  99
1            | 99  39   4  81  28  69
2            | 44  97   5  10  51  80
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Choose items where Agent 0 has high valuations.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items where Agent 1 has high valuations, avoiding overlaps with Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate remaining items to Agent 2, aiming for balance.

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (Value 99), Item 2 (Value 85)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (Value 99), Item 3 (Value 81)
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 (Value 97), Item 4 (Value 51)

This allocation ensures each agent receives valuable items, and no items are left unallocated.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents fairly, based on their valuations.
