Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  23  58  38  83  65
1  58  56  54  52  19  56
2  89  72  22  15  68   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value for each agent. One approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item, ensuring each item is allocated once and each agent gets a fair share. Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Items and values: 0 (35), 1 (23), 2 (58), 3 (38), 4 (83), 5 (65)

Agent 1:
- Items and values: 0 (58), 1 (56), 2 (54), 3 (52), 4 (19), 5 (56)

Agent 2:
- Items and values: 0 (89), 1 (72), 2 (22), 3 (15), 4 (68), 5 (1)

We can use a strategy where we consider assigning items based on who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair number of items. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as they value it the highest with 83.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they value it the highest with 89.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they value it the second highest with 72.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they value it the highest after item 4 with 65.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the highest with 54.
6. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they value it second highest after item 2 with 52.

After this allocation, each agent has been assigned two items:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

Now, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
