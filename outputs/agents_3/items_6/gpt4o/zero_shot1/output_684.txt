Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  80  33  88  40  53
1  10  13  54  10  24  99
2  51  15  65  71  63  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing total valuation, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall happiness of the agents. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 10, and Agent 2 at 51. We assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 13, and Agent 2 at 15. We assign it to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 54, and Agent 2 at 65. We assign it to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 10, and Agent 2 at 71. We assign it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 24, and Agent 2 at 63. We assign it to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 99, and Agent 2 at 71. We assign it to Agent 1.

The allocation strategy ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, with no items left unallocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
