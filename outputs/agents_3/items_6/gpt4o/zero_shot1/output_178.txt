Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  38  44  30  78  35
1  45  66  21  51  72  49
2   1  93  90  85  23  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 38 44 30 78 35]
 [45 66 21 51 72 49]
 [ 1 93 90 85 23 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**
   - Valuations: [20, 38, 44, 30, 78, 35]
   - Highest value is 78 for item 4.

2. **Agent 1**
   - Valuations: [45, 66, 21, 51, 72, 49]
   - Highest value is 72 for item 4, but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest is 66 for item 1.

3. **Agent 2**
   - Valuations: [1, 93, 90, 85, 23, 79]
   - Highest value is 93 for item 1, but it's already taken by Agent 1. The next highest is 90 for item 2.

Now, let's assign additional items focusing on maximizing overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (value 35) since it's the highest remaining value for them.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 51) since it's the highest remaining value for them.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 (value 1) since it's the only remaining item.

Thus, each agent gets two items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
