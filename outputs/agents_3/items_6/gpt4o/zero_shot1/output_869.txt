Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  79  75  30  13  28
1  12  83  71  50  60  72
2  21   9  50  25   4  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuation each agent has for each item and aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction across all agents is maximized. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 and also values items 2 and 5 significantly.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations overall, but item 5 holds moderate value.

To maximize overall satisfaction, we might start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents that value them the most. Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 as well, as they have high valuation and it complements item 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a low value for everyone but highest for Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it complements their set without taking from others' high values.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is valuable to them and less so to others.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they have some value for it and it helps with balance.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items, with Agent 1 receiving the most valuable items according to their preferences, and Agents 0 and 2 receiving items that are of less value to others.
