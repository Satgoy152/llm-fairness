Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  83  40  54  85   4
1   9   5  80  15  94  84
2  37  93  99  23  61  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent gets a roughly equal value from their allocated items, while also making sure all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0: 65 + 83 + 40 + 54 + 85 + 4 = 331
   - Agent 1: 9 + 5 + 80 + 15 + 94 + 84 = 287
   - Agent 2: 37 + 93 + 99 + 23 + 61 + 72 = 385

2. Allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

3. Assign the items based on the highest valuations for each item:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (65), Agent 1 (9), Agent 2 (37) — Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (83), Agent 1 (5), Agent 2 (93) — Assign to Agent 2
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (40), Agent 1 (80), Agent 2 (99) — Assign to Agent 2
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (54), Agent 1 (15), Agent 2 (23) — Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (85), Agent 1 (94), Agent 2 (61) — Assign to Agent 1
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (4), Agent 1 (84), Agent 2 (72) — Assign to Agent 1

4. Ensure each agent gets at least one item and the allocations are fair in terms of value.

The final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, ensuring fairness considering their valuations and preferences.
