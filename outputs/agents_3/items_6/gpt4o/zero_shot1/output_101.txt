Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  67  49  71  18  84
1  88  85  28  49  87  60
2  81  19  47  14  58  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the distribution maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We can approach this by trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the best way to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (84), Item 3 (71), Item 1 (67)
   - Allocate: Item 5 (value 84)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (88), Item 4 (87), Item 1 (85)
   - Allocate: Item 0 (value 88), Item 4 (value 87)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (81), Item 2 (47), Item 4 (58)
   - Allocate: Item 2 (value 47), Item 3 (value 14), Item 1 (value 19)

Given these allocations, we need to balance and ensure that all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0** has Item 5.
- **Agent 1** has Items 0 and 4.
- **Agent 2** has Items 1, 2, and 3.

This distribution ensures that each agent gets some items and that the total valuation is maximized for all agents based on the highest individual item values:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the three agents.
