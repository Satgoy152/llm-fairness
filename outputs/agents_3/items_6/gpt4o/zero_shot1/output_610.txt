Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  21  19  98   0  80
1  55   2  66  35  55  49
2  71  35  82  26  93  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced or optimized. Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least some items.

Let's evaluate the item valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest (71).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (35).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest (82).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest (98).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest (93).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (80).

Given these valuations, we can start by assigning items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5 (Total value: 98 + 80 = 178)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Total value: 66)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 4 (Total value: 71 + 35 + 93 = 199)

Each agent receives a fair allocation based on their preferences, although Agent 1 gets only one item, it is the highest-valued item available after Agent 2's allocations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
