Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  41   8  58  94  42
1  87  58  15   6  79  24
2  49  62  54  58  54  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 0 41  8 58 94 42]
 [87 58 15  6 79 24]
 [49 62 54 58 54 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction in terms of the total value they receive, while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 will receive items: 4 (value 94) and 3 (value 58)
- Agent 1 will receive items: 0 (value 87) and 1 (value 58)
- Agent 2 will receive items: 2 (value 54) and 5 (value 25)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items while trying to maximize the total value for each.

The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
