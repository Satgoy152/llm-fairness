Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  43  78  67  11  55
1  16   0   9  82  18  56
2  33  53  27  52  47  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a round-robin or similar allocation method to ensure a fair distribution of value.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [59, 43, 78, 67, 11, 55]
Agent 1: [16, 0, 9, 82, 18, 56]
Agent 2: [33, 53, 27, 52, 47, 34]
```

We can allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total value:

1. Start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate them one by one considering the other agents' preferences.

2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and try to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (78). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (82). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (53). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has item 2. Next highest for Agent 0 is item 0 (59). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has item 3. Next highest for Agent 1 is item 5 (56). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has item 1. Next highest for Agent 2 is item 4 (47). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

The last remaining item is item 3, which is already allocated to Agent 1, so we revise:

Assign item 2 to Agent 0, item 3 to Agent 1, and item 4 to Agent 2. Now, distribute remaining items to balance values as much as possible:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (total value = 133).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (total value = 98).
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (total value = 100).

With this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 0]
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 4]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
