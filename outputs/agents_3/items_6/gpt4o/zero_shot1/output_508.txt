Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  98  22  95  58   6
1  15  88  14  58  92  17
2  68  76  48  41  35  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common goal in such allocations is to maximize the total valuation or ensure equitable distribution by considering the preferences of each agent.

Let's consider the following strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair share of items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 15, and Agent 2 values it at 68. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 88, and Agent 2 values it at 76. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 14, and Agent 2 values it at 48. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 58, and Agent 2 values it at 41. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 92, and Agent 2 values it at 35. Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 17, and Agent 2 values it at 27. Agent 2 values it the most.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 2 takes items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 0 takes items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 takes item 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives items in a way that considers their valuations.
