Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  35  85  91  56  53
1  74  67   8  87  84  54
2  20  83  33  95  94  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 67  8 87 84 54]
 [20 83 33 95 94 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and every item is allocated. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Analyze the valuations:
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 2, 3, and 0.
   - Agent 1 has high values for items 0, 3, and 4.
   - Agent 2 has high values for items 3, 4, and 1.

2. Allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 2 and 0. The highest values for agent 0 are 85 and 71.
   - Agent 1: Allocate items 3 and 4. The highest values for agent 1 are 87 and 84.
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 5 and 1. The highest values for agent 2 are 26 and 83.

3. Verify allocation:
   - Total items allocated: 6 (2 items per agent as needed).

Now, present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
