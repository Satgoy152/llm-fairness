Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  67  65  50  65   0
1  53  26   9  32  39  20
2  92  61  99  92  90  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 26  9 32 39 20]
 [92 61 99 92 90 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. Agent 1 has lower valuations across all items but may receive a lower-value item.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations, especially for items 2, 3, and 4.

Based on these observations, here's a potential allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 92.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it at 67.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest at 99.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it at 92.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as a reasonable allocation considering their valuations.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as they are indifferent to it with a valuation of 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items and the total valuation is reasonably balanced. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
