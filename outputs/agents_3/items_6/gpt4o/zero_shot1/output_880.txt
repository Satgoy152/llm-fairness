Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50   4  17  91  10   1
1  12  75  80  26  17  55
2  75   2   0  91  80  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75  2  0 91 80 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 highly, so we start by assigning it to them. We then look at the remaining items to see which they value the most.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 highly, so we assign it to them. We look at the remaining items for their next highest valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 highly, so we assign it to them. We then look at their next highest valued item among the remaining ones.

Continuing this process to fill the total of 6 items, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 0.

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that maximize their valuation while distributing the items as fairly as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```
