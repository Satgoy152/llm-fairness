Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  60   4  65  81  30
1  38  29  47  84  42  20
2  17  24  60  78  63  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [38 29 47 84 42 20]
 [17 24 60 78 63 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. In this scenario, we will attempt to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by giving them items they value highly.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that they value highly.
- Agent 1: Allocate items that they value highly.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that they value highly.

Let's look at the values:

```
Agent 0: 15, 60, 4, 65, 81, 30
Agent 1: 38, 29, 47, 84, 42, 20
Agent 2: 17, 24, 60, 78, 63, 71
```

One way to allocate the items is as follows:

- Assign item 4 and item 1 to Agent 0 because they have high valuations for these items (81 and 60).
- Assign item 3 and item 2 to Agent 1 because they have high valuations for these items (84 and 47).
- Assign item 5 and item 0 to Agent 2 because they have relatively high valuations for these items (71 and 17).

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation across agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
