Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  74   1  30  42  17
1  60  12  34   7  43  10
2   1  89  20   0  10   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 89 20  0 10  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to maximize the value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [70, 74, 1, 30, 42, 17]
- Agent 1: [60, 12, 34, 7, 43, 10]
- Agent 2: [1, 89, 20, 0, 10, 6]

We can start by assigning items based on the highest available valuation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 1.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most after Agent 0's highest preferences are allocated.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most, considering the remaining items.

Assign the items as follows:

1. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items (3 and 4) based on the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 since it's their next highest valuation.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as it maximizes their valuation better than Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items relative to their valuations. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This distribution allocates all six items among the three agents, ensuring each gets an integer number of items while aiming to maximize their respective valuations.
