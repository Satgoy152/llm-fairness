Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  74  73  24  96  21
1  89  17  29  32  94  70
2   8  98  31  59   9  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 98 31 59  9 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. A common approach is to use a method inspired by the Hungarian algorithm, focusing on maximizing the total value distributed among the agents. 

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Evaluate the highest value for each agent and assign that item to them, if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the value for each agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (96).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (89).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (98).

Allocate these items first:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we allocate the remaining items 2, 3, and 5:

- Item 5 is valued at 70 by Agent 1, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Item 2 is valued at 73 by Agent 0 and 31 by Agent 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 for higher total valuation.
- Item 3 is valued at 59 by Agent 2, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
