Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  52  35  23  53  30
1  32   2   8  72  30  42
2  54  35  94  37  83  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32  2  8 72 30 42]
 [54 35 94 37 83 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to provide each agent with a set of items such that their overall satisfaction (valuation) is reasonably balanced. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [52, 52, 35, 23, 53, 30]
- Agent 1: [32, 2, 8, 72, 30, 42]
- Agent 2: [54, 35, 94, 37, 83, 85]

To maximize fairness, we can use the following approach:

1. Assign high-value items to each agent, aiming to maximize total valuation while ensuring each agent receives 2 items.

2. Create an allocation that balances the total valuation as much as possible.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1 (Total value: 52 + 52 = 104)
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 5 (Total value: 72 + 42 = 114)
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4 (Total value: 94 + 83 = 177)

This allocation ensures each agent receives 2 items, and the distribution attempts to balance the valuations, although there is some unavoidable discrepancy due to the high value item 2 for Agent 2.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
