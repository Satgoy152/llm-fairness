Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  65  43  61  10  24
1  44  97  26  29  49  35
2  82  58  73  23  27  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 58 73 23 27 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will consider the highest valued items for each agent and ensure all items are allocated.

Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 0, 1, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items: 1, 4, and 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items: 0, 2, and 5.

Let's aim to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 82 is the highest for this item).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 97 is the highest for this item).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 73 is the highest for this item).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 61 is the highest for this item).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 49 is the highest for this item).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 24 is the highest for this item).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
