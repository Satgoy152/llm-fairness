Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  49  46  22  80  72
1  97  61  10  34  24   2
2  21  53   0  58  32  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A simple approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 4 (80)
   - Allocation: Items 0 and 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 1 (61)
   - Allocation: Items 1 and 3

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (58), Item 1 (53)
   - Allocation: Items 2 and 5

Checking this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are assigned. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their preferences.
