Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  37  10  22  65  71
1   6   6  27  70  15  46
2  92  97  41  75  31  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6  6 27 70 15 46]
 [92 97 41 75 31 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agents based on the highest individual valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 4 (65) and 5 (71).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 3 (70).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 0 (92), 1 (97), and 5 (92).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 71) because they have the highest value for that item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 70) because they have the highest value for that item.
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 2 (values 92 and 97) because they have the highest values for these items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 65) since Agent 0 has a high valuation and Agent 2 has already been prioritized with items 0 and 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 27) to balance the number of items between agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is six, as required.
