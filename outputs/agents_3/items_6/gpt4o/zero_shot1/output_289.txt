Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  22   0  79  14  57
1  78  82  12  86  15  13
2  87  32  78  75   3   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's overall satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent to ensure each gets something valuable.
2. **Consider Overall Balance**: Try to balance the allocation so that the total value of items for each agent is roughly similar.
3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Make sure all items are allocated, and no agent receives more than their fair share if it can be avoided.

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (79).
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest (82).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (87).

Assign these items first:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have assigned 3 out of the 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining items 2, 4, and 5.

- **Remaining items and their values:**
  - Item 2: Agent 0 (0), Agent 1 (12), Agent 2 (78)
  - Item 4: Agent 0 (14), Agent 1 (15), Agent 2 (3)
  - Item 5: Agent 0 (57), Agent 1 (13), Agent 2 (8)

- **Assign item 2 to Agent 2** (highest value for Agent 2, 78).
- **Assign item 5 to Agent 0** (highest value for Agent 0, 57).
- **Assign item 4 to Agent 1** (highest value for Agent 1, 15).

Now, we have allocated all 6 items. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
