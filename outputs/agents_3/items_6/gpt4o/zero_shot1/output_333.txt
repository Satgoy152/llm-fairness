Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  20  38   9  25  99
1   4  48  50  81  95   4
2  25  94  59  63  62   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 94 59 63 62  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value derived by the agents. Let's analyze the given valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 72  
- Item 1: 20  
- Item 2: 38  
- Item 3: 9  
- Item 4: 25  
- Item 5: 99  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 4  
- Item 1: 48  
- Item 2: 50  
- Item 3: 81  
- Item 4: 95  
- Item 5: 4  

Agent 2's valuations:  
- Item 0: 25  
- Item 1: 94  
- Item 2: 59  
- Item 3: 63  
- Item 4: 62  
- Item 5: 2  

To make an optimal allocation, we can start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (99), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (95), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (94), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items, and each agent has received one. Let's allocate the remaining 3 items:

4. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (81), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (59), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (72), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
