Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  56  28  63  92  29
1   3   5  96   5  41  29
2  54   0  75  23  44  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54  0 75 23 44 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation using a method that tries to maximize the total value:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (92), Item 3 (63), Item 1 (56)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 4 (41), Item 0 (3)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (54), Item 2 (75), Item 4 (44)
   - Allocate Items 0 and 5 to Agent 2.

Now, for the remaining items:

- Item 1 and Item 3 are left unallocated.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 56) as Agent 0 has the highest value for it among the unallocated items.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 63) as Agent 0 has the highest value for it among the unallocated items.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
