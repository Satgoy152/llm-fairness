Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  86  24  17  80  94
1  46  74  31  65  84  69
2  18  61  80  80  37  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to give each agent a reasonable value based on their preferences. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a fairly balanced interest, with the highest in item 4.
3. **Agent 2** shows high interest in items 2, 3, and 5.

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a balanced portion of their top choices:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 5
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets two of their higher-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
