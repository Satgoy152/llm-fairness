Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  89  74  22  35  86
1  65  99  76  79   9  78
2  84  51  33  29  70  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 51 33 29 70 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and make a fair allocation:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 22
  - Item 4: 35
  - Item 5: 86

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 79
  - Item 4: 9
  - Item 5: 78

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 29
  - Item 4: 70
  - Item 5: 89

### Allocation Strategy:
To achieve a fair allocation, prioritize items according to agents' highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 1** highly values Item 1 (99), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values Item 0 (84), so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** highly values Item 5 (86), so assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** next highest value is for Item 3 (79), assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 2** next highest value is for Item 4 (70), assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 0** next highest value is for Item 2 (74), assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This approach ensures each agent has an opportunity to maximize their valuations under the constraint that all items must be allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
