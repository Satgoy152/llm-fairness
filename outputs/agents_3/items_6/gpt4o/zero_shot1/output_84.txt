Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  26  26   6  56  24
1  48  42  90  31  31  99
2  67  68  16  24  69  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We can use a simple approach to assign the most valued items to each agent. Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (56), 0 (28), 1 (26)
   - Allocate: Item 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (99), 2 (90), 0 (48)
   - Allocate: Item 5

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (69), 1 (68), 0 (67)
   - Allocate: Item 1

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while considering the highest remaining values:

4. **Remaining Items: 0, 2, 3**
   - Agent 0: Remaining highest valued item is 0 (28)
   - Agent 1: Remaining highest valued item is 2 (90)
   - Agent 2: Remaining highest valued item is 3 (24)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
