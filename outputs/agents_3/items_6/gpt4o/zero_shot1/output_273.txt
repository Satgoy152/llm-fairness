Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  81  39  62  58  59
1  97   1  15  50   2  87
2  66  67  23  78  43  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (81) and 3 (62), so we'll allocate these to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (97) and item 5 (87), so we'll allocate these to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 (78) and 5 (85), but since item 3 is already allocated, we can assign item 2 (23) and item 4 (43) to Agent 2.

After allocating items based on the highest valuations for each agent and ensuring each agent gets items that maximize their satisfaction, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

These allocations aim to maximize the total value received by each agent based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
