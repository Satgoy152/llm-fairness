Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  92  22  11  58  49
1  70  30  94  62  38  72
2  32  56  84  35  75  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives. Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. Let's start by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (92), Item 0 (55)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (94), Item 5 (72)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 4 (75)

Since Item 5 was assigned to both Agent 1 and Agent 2, we need to resolve this conflict. We'll assign Item 5 to Agent 2 because Agent 2's next highest value after 94 (Item 5) is 75 (Item 4), while Agent 1's next highest value is 62 (Item 3). This means Agent 1 can be more satisfied by receiving Item 3 instead.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 4

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items based on agent valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
