Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  81   9  45  80  66
1   4  53  97  22  98   6
2  88  22  13  64  95  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 22 13 64 95 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent one by one to ensure fairness.
2. Then, distribute remaining items to maximize total value.

Let's start by evaluating the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0's values: [19, 81, 9, 45, 80, 66]
- Agent 1's values: [4, 53, 97, 22, 98, 6]
- Agent 2's values: [88, 22, 13, 64, 95, 81]

Assign the highest valued item to each agent first:
- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 81)
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 98)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 88)

Now, we have 3 items left to allocate (items 2, 3, 5).

Next, distribute remaining items for maximizing the total value:
- Agent 0's next highest value: item 4 (value 80), but it's already taken, so item 5 (value 66)
- Agent 1's next highest value: item 2 (value 97), but it's already taken, so item 3 (value 22)
- Agent 2's next highest value: item 5 (value 81), but it's already taken, so item 3 (value 64)

Now, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we finalize the allocation as:
- Agent 0: items 1, 5
- Agent 1: items 4, 3
- Agent 2: items 0, 2

Here's the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
