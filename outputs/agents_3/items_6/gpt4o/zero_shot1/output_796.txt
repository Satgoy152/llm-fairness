Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  98  40  58  45  72
1   8   1  13  99  32  72
2   4  63  87  71  95  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 98 40 58 45 72]
 [ 8  1 13 99 32 72]
 [ 4 63 87 71 95 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a balanced share based on their valuations. We will aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0:  [67, 98, 40, 58, 45, 72]
Agent 1:  [8, 1, 13, 99, 32, 72]
Agent 2:  [4, 63, 87, 71, 95, 82]
```

Based on these valuations, we can aim for the following allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: We will assign items that Agent 0 values highly relative to other agents. Items 0 and 1 are particularly high for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: We will assign items that Agent 1 values highly relative to other agents. Item 3 is particularly high for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: We will assign items that Agent 2 values highly relative to other agents. Items 2, 4, and 5 are high for Agent 2.

After considering these factors, a possible fair allocation is:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign items 2, 4, and 5 to Agent 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
