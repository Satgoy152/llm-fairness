Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  82  21  12  24  47
1  21   4  11  92  50  61
2  63  10  79  19   5  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 82 21 12 24 47]
 [21  4 11 92 50 61]
 [63 10 79 19  5 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll try to assign items such that each agent is satisfied based on their given valuations.

Let's analyze the options:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.

Based on this analysis, we can try to allocate items as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valuation 42).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (valuation 82).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valuation 92).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (valuation 50).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (valuation 79).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (valuation 41).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is relatively high.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
