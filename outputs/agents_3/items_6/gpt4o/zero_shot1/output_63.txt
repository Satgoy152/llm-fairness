Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  60  33  13  27  16
1  38  33  40  33  51  76
2  80   9  51  76  50  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: [87, 60, 33, 13, 27, 16]
   - Agent 1: [38, 33, 40, 33, 51, 76]
   - Agent 2: [80, 9, 51, 76, 50, 36]

2. **Rank the items for each agent based on their valuation:**

   - Agent 0: 0 (87), 1 (60), 2 (33), 4 (27), 5 (16), 3 (13)
   - Agent 1: 5 (76), 4 (51), 2 (40), 0 (38), 1 (33), 3 (33)
   - Agent 2: 3 (76), 0 (80), 2 (51), 4 (50), 5 (36), 1 (9)

3. **Allocate items starting from the highest valuation:**

   - Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (87)
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (76)
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (76)

4. **Continue allocating the remaining items:**

   - Next highest for Agent 0 (who has only one item so far): 1 (60)
   - Next highest for Agent 1 (who has one item): 4 (51)
   - Next highest for Agent 2 (who has one item): 2 (51)

5. **Check allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: [5, 4]
   - Agent 2: [3, 2]

6. **Final allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and the total number of items allocated is 6, with each agent receiving their preferred items based on the ranking of their valuations.
