Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  42  57  29  10  92
1  72  82  99  66  76  27
2  59  43  32  56  65  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. It's important to balance the overall satisfaction among the agents. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items for Agent 0 are 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items for Agent 1 are 2 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items for Agent 2 are 4 and 3.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4

This distribution ensures that all agents receive items and that the total valuation is distributed as fairly as possible among the agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
