Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  75  18  30  46   0
1  28  79  81  91   7  87
2   2  25  89  97  27  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent seems to value item 1 the most (75), followed by item 4 (46).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 3 (91) and item 2 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 the most (97), followed by item 2 (89).

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 1 and item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 and item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 and item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
