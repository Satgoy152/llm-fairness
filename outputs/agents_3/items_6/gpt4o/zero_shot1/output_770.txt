Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  57  12  22  94   3
1  82  82  95  15  40  19
2  85  60  99  22  14  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 82 95 15 40 19]
 [85 60 99 22 14 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim for a distribution that maximizes total satisfaction or value. Given the constraints that each agent can receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we can attempt to assign items in a way that balances the overall value gained by each agent.

Let's analyze the table and assign items:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**: [69, 57, 12, 22, 94, 3]
2. **Agent 1's valuations**: [82, 82, 95, 15, 40, 19]
3. **Agent 2's valuations**: [85, 60, 99, 22, 14, 56]

### Initial Allocation Strategy:
- Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

### Step-by-step allocation:
1. **Highest value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 has highest value for item 4 (94)
   - Agent 1 has highest value for item 2 (95)
   - Agent 2 has highest value for item 2 (99), but since item 2 is already allocated, choose the next highest, item 0 (85)

2. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - After initial allocation, items 1, 3, and 5 remain. 
   - Assign remaining items to maximize fair distribution.

3. **Complete the allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (57)
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (19)
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (22)

This distribution balances the items based on valuations and ensures each agent receives some items.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items in a manner that considers their highest valuations.
