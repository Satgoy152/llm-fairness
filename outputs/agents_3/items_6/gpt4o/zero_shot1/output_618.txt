Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  83  88  76   8  40
1  95  42  84  38  31  99
2  78  53  34  35  73  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 53 34 35 73 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation of the items each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to assign items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [39, 83, 88, 76, 8, 40]
- Agent 1: [95, 42, 84, 38, 31, 99]
- Agent 2: [78, 53, 34, 35, 73, 69]

Let's look at the highest valuations for each item across all agents:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 83.
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 88.
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 76.
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 73.
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 99.

Now, we can allocate items based on these valuations while ensuring a fair distribution among agents:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of items they value highly.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
