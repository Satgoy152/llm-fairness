Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  75  35  28  96  42
1  99  55   9  37  40  48
2  13  76  49  55  87  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent gets items that they value highly.

Let's consider a way to assign items based on maximizing value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (96)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 1 (75)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (99)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 3 (37)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (76)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 5 (59)

Now, let's perform the allocation:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2)

Reviewing remaining items:
- Item 1 is valued highly by both Agents 0 and 2, but Agent 0 has already received an item, so assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Item 3 valued by Agent 1, so assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 should receive at least one more item)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with each item allocated exactly once.
