Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  30  23  68  92  36
1  73  94  29  87  18  86
2  80  61  67  23  54  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 23
  - Item 3: 68
  - Item 4: 92
  - Item 5: 36

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 87
  - Item 4: 18
  - Item 5: 86

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 54
  - Item 5: 46

One approach to fairly allocate the items is to consider a balanced distribution based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 6. We can try to ensure each agent receives at least two items if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign items to Agent 0:
  - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 3 (92 and 68, respectively).
  
- Assign items to Agent 1:
  - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 5 (94 and 86, respectively).
  
- Assign items to Agent 2:
  - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 2 (80 and 67, respectively).

This way, each agent gets two items. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
