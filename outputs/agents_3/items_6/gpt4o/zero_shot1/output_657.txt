Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  84  33  98  90  15
1  74  75  78  35   9  74
2  43  19  18   0  59   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 75 78 35  9 74]
 [43 19 18  0 59  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is maximized according to their preferences. We will consider the valuations and try to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (98), followed by items 4 (90) and 0 or 1 (both 84).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (78), followed by items 1 (75) and 0 (74).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (59), followed by items 0 (43) and 1 (19).

Based on these observations, we will attempt to allocate items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 78).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 59).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 84).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 74).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 43).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their most valued items while keeping the distribution relatively fair.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
