Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  52  67  59  47  85
1  90  55  93  55   9   4
2  45  47  59  59  95   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to distribute the items such that the total perceived value is maximized while ensuring fairness.

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 5 (85), Item 0 (80), Item 2 (67)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 2 (93), Item 0 (90), Item 1 (55)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 4 (95), Item 3 (59), Item 2 (59)

Considering these valuations, we can allocate based on the highest values, ensuring no conflicts:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as they value it highly (90).
2. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they value it highly (85).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the highest (93).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 2, as they value it the highest (95).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it (59) and need at least two items.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they have a decent valuation for it (47).

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with their highest valued available items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
