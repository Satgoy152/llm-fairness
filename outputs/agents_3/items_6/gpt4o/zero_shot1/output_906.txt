Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  36  94  51  39  33
1  78  36  65  23  92  75
2  57  16   0  30  86  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 36 65 23 92 75]
 [57 16  0 30 86 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm or solve it as a linear assignment problem. Here, I'll attempt a manual allocation that balances total valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 0 (82)
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 4 (92), Item 5 (75)
   - Allocate Item 4 and Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 4 (86), Item 5 (67)
   - Allocate remaining items, Item 3 and Item 1, to Agent 2 since they need to receive items and the high-value ones are already allocated.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
