Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  69  61  53  13  15
1  94  44   9  50  77  16
2   9  19   0  89  44  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 44  9 50 77 16]
 [ 9 19  0 89 44 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll try to ensure that each agent receives approximately equal total valuation, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 4.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 3.

Now, allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

4. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 1.
5. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 5.
6. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 2.

This allocation process provides each agent with two items and attempts to balance their total valuations.

The final allocation can be presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
