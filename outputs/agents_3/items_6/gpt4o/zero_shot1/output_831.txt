Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  45  37  50  12  29
1  47  10  94  24  44  58
2  40  98   5  93  16  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 98  5 93 16 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 96. 
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 94.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 98.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Next, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0 (continued):**
   - Among the remaining items (3, 4, 5), Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 50.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1 (continued):**
   - Among the remaining items (4, 5), Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 58.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2 (continued):**
   - The only remaining item is 4, and it goes to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a good value based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
