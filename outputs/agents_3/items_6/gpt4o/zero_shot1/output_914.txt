Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  30  84  97  33  58
1  92  27  83  26  82   2
2  33  56  26  21  84  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for every item and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieve that:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent places on an item** and try to ensure each agent gets at least one of their top valued items.
2. **Distribute remaining items** by ensuring fairness and considering the next highest values.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 (97) and 2 (84). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 (92) and 2 (83). Item 0 is not yet taken, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 4 (84) and 5 (65). Item 4 is not taken, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Items left**: [1, 2, 5]
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (next highest value 84).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (next highest value 27).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (next highest value 65).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their highest-value items and all items are distributed.
