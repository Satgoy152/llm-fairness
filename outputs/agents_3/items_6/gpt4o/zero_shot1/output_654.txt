Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  92  83  85  63  85
1  84  78  34  44  94  27
2  85  19  16  29  77  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 78 34 44 94 27]
 [85 19 16 29 77 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, given that there are 6 items and 3 agents. Here is a possible allocation strategy based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 4 items (0, 1, 4, and 5). We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (2 and 3).

4. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2:
     - Agent 0: 83
     - Agent 1: 34
     - Agent 2: 16
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value).

5. **Allocate Remaining Item:**
   - Item 3:
     - Agent 0: 85
     - Agent 1: 44
     - Agent 2: 29
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value).

After allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
