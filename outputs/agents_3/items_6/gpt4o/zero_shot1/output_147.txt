Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29   4  66  27  67  17
1  34  34  96  40  67  82
2  67  62  87   6  31  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [67 62 87  6 31 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 27
  - Item 4: 67
  - Item 5: 17

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 40
  - Item 4: 67
  - Item 5: 82

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 6
  - Item 4: 31
  - Item 5: 99

To create a fair allocation, we can consider assigning each agent items with the highest valuations available to them, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

A possible allocation:

- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (67 is the highest value for agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (96 is the highest value for agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (99 is the highest value for agent 2).

Then, for the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (67 is a high remaining value for agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (40 is a high remaining value for agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (4 is the remaining item for agent 0).

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```
