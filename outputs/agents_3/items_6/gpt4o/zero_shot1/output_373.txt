Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  52  56  60  47   3
1  49  63  96  69   6  56
2   4  87  97  57  36  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 63 96 69  6 56]
 [ 4 87 97 57 36 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List All Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [85, 52, 56, 60, 47, 3]
   - Agent 1: [49, 63, 96, 69, 6, 56]
   - Agent 2: [4, 87, 97, 57, 36, 36]

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Total Value**:
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Check Assignment for Each Item**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 69.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 47.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 56.

4. **Review Assignments**:
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0, 4]
   - Agent 1: [3, 5]
   - Agent 2: [1, 2]

The allocations in json format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
