Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  31  81  12  56  56
1  53  61  90  29  21  68
2  78  38  26  17  92  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuations for each item and determine which agent values each item the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (78).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (61).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (29).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (92).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (87).

Now, let's assign the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items:

1. **Agent 0**: No items are initially assigned to Agent 0 because they never have the highest valuation for any item.
2. **Agent 1**: Initially, Items 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Initially, Items 0, 4, and 5 are assigned to Agent 2.

This allocation gives Agent 1 and Agent 2 three items each, while Agent 0 receives none. This is a fair distribution based on maximizing the valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
