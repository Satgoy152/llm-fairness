Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  51  26  42  87  57
1  36  40  32  23  76  74
2  58  58  69  97  97  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a systematic approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign the Highest Valued Item for Each Agent**: Start by initially allocating the item that has the highest value for each agent. This ensures each agent gets an item they value the most.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Once each agent has at least one item, distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations that have not yet been allocated, while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (highest value for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (highest value for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (highest value for agent 2)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 3):

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 1 can be assigned item 2, as it is one of the higher remaining values for them.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
