Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  55  94  39  74  50
1   8  31  47  42  71  76
2  38  78  10  83  39  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 31 47 42 71 76]
 [38 78 10 83 39 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuation table for guidance:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  55  94  39  74  50
1   8  31  47  42  71  76
2  38  78  10  83  39  74
```

One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item among the agents. We will go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 62.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 78.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 83.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 76.

Now, ensuring a fair distribution might require a slight adjustment to make sure each agent has an integer number of items and the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's refine the allocation to ensure fairness:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 5]
- Agent 2 receives items [1, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items (2), and the total number of items allocated is 6. The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
