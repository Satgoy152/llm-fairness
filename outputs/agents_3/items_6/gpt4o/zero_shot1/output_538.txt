Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  76  95  48  39   6
1  62  99  37  95  16  91
2  82  56  94  60  45  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 4 76 95 48 39  6]
 [62 99 37 95 16 91]
 [82 56 94 60 45 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuation based on the given table. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (95), Item 1 (76), Item 3 (48)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 3 (95), Item 5 (91)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 0 (82), Item 3 (60)

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 1 highly values Item 1 (99), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (95), so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 also highly values Item 5 (91), so assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values Item 0 (82), so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 values Item 3 (48) next, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values Item 4 (45) next, so assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has received items based on their highest values, and all items have been allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
