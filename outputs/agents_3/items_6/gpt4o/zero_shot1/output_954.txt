Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  69  88  57  77  35
1  38  76  60  26  45  97
2  72  17  96  45  74  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 69 88 57 77 35]
 [38 76 60 26 45 97]
 [72 17 96 45 74 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0  58  69  88  57  77  35
Agent 1  38  76  60  26  45  97
Agent 2  72  17  96  45  74  51
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method where we attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One way to approach this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, then checks for fairness and adjusts if necessary.

Here's an allocation that considers each agent's valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 72, the highest among all agents.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 76, the highest among all agents.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 96, the highest among all agents.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 57, the highest among all agents.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, the highest among all agents.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 97, the highest among all agents.

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent getting at least one item, and it respects the highest valuations each agent has for the items they receive.
