Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  32  73  64  76   5
1   1  44  90  40   8  83
2  84  27  78   6  66   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 44 90 40  8 83]
 [84 27 78  6 66  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation of the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [19, 32, 73, 64, 76, 5]
- Agent 1 values: [1, 44, 90, 40, 8, 83]
- Agent 2 values: [84, 27, 78, 6, 66, 7]

We want to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0: 19
   - Agent 1: 1
   - Agent 2: 84 (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 32
   - Agent 1: 44 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 27

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 73
   - Agent 1: 90 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 78

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 64 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1: 40
   - Agent 2: 6

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 76 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 1: 8
   - Agent 2: 66

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0: 5
   - Agent 1: 83 (highest valuation)
   - Agent 2: 7

Now, let's allocate the items based on the analysis:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is six.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```
