Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  78  54   0  79  59
1  62  46  78  46  41  30
2  39  87  73  61  21  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 87 73 61 21 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes fairness, such as the "max-min" approach, which aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [54, 78, 54, 0, 79, 59]
- Agent 1: [62, 46, 78, 46, 41, 30]
- Agent 2: [39, 87, 73, 61, 21, 24]

To allocate fairly, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first if it does not conflict with another agent's high valued item.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Allocate remaining items by considering the highest value left for each agent.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 2 (87) and Agent 0 (78). However, it's the highest for Agent 2, so assign **Item 1** to Agent 2.
2. **Item 4** is the highest for Agent 0 (79), assign **Item 4** to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2** is the highest for Agent 1 (78), assign **Item 2** to Agent 1.
4. Now, allocate remaining items considering the next highest values, trying to balance fairness and maximize satisfaction:
   - **Item 0** is valued at 54 by Agent 0 and 62 by Agent 1. Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1.
   - **Item 3** is valued at 61 by Agent 2. Assign **Item 3** to Agent 2.
   - **Item 5** is left. Assign **Item 5** to Agent 0 (59).

Now, let's present the final allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair allocation based on their highest preferences, and all six items are allocated.
