Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  92  55  59  68  36
1  82  45  49   6  48  61
2  33  33  30  39  19  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 45 49  6 48 61]
 [33 33 30 39 19 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items to the 3 agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively low valuations for most items, but can consider items that are less valued by the others.

Let's assign the items based on maximizing the total valuations each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0** receives items:
   - Item 1 (valuation 92)
   - Item 3 (valuation 59)

2. **Agent 1** receives items:
   - Item 0 (valuation 82)
   - Item 5 (valuation 61)

3. **Agent 2** receives items:
   - Item 2 (valuation 30)
   - Item 4 (valuation 19)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
