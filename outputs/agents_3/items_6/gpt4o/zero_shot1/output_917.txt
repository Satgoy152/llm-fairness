Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  87  28  57  35  32
1  91   1  62   8  96  77
2  97   9  88  57   3  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91  1 62  8 96 77]
 [97  9 88 57  3 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the breakdown of the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 58
  - Agent 1 values it at 91
  - Agent 2 values it at 97

- Item 1: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 87
  - Agent 1 values it at 1
  - Agent 2 values it at 9

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 28
  - Agent 1 values it at 62
  - Agent 2 values it at 88

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 57
  - Agent 1 values it at 8
  - Agent 2 values it at 57

- Item 4: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 35
  - Agent 1 values it at 96
  - Agent 2 values it at 3

- Item 5: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 32
  - Agent 1 values it at 77
  - Agent 2 values it at 14

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (97).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (87).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (88).
4. **Item 3**: Both Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it equally (57). Let's assign it to Agent 0 for balance.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (96).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (77).

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above decisions, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
