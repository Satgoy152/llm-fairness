Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  95  49   0   7  57
1  93  20  22  34  39  23
2  69  91  96  80  49  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 20 22 34 39 23]
 [69 91 96 80 49 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 2 (49)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 4 (39)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 5 (98), Item 1 (91)

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 1 (value 95)
- **Agent 1:** Item 0 (value 93), Item 4 (value 39)
- **Agent 2:** Item 2 (value 96), Item 5 (value 98), Item 3 (value 80)

Now, let's format this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes their individual valuations based on the given data.
