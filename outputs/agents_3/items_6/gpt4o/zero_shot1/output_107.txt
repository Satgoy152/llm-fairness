Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  72  80  55  24  24
1  59  77  24  76  76  80
2  93  94   3  31   3  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 94  3 31  3 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider their valuations and aim to achieve a balance in the overall value each agent receives. We'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share of value based on their preferences.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt to balance the value each agent receives:

Agent 0:
- Values of items: [9, 72, 80, 55, 24, 24]

Agent 1:
- Values of items: [59, 77, 24, 76, 76, 80]

Agent 2:
- Values of items: [93, 94, 3, 31, 3, 70]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the following strategy:

1. Give each agent a high-value item they value the most.
2. Distribute remaining items to equalize the total value as much as possible.

Let's create an allocation based on this:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 80).
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 80).
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 94).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the total value:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 55).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 76).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 93).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable share of value based on their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
