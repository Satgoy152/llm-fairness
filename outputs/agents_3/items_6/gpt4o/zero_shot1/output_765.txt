Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  29  82  64  94   8
1  99  48  26  86  20  71
2   8  94  73   0  98  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 48 26 86 20 71]
 [ 8 94 73  0 98 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's break down the allocation step-by-step:

- For item 0, the valuations are [73, 99, 8]. Agent 1 values it the most.
- For item 1, the valuations are [29, 48, 94]. Agent 2 values it the most.
- For item 2, the valuations are [82, 26, 73]. Agent 0 values it the most.
- For item 3, the valuations are [64, 86, 0]. Agent 1 values it the most.
- For item 4, the valuations are [94, 20, 98]. Agent 2 values it the most.
- For item 5, the valuations are [8, 71, 73]. Agent 2 values it the most.

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0: Item 2
2. Agent 1: Items 0, 3
3. Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 5

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
