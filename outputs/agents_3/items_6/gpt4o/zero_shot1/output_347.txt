Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  48  22  39  48   3
1  31  43  53  55  82  66
2  59  24  10   4  94  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 43 53 55 82 66]
 [59 24 10  4 94 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values items: 
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 4: 48
  - Item 5: 3

- **Agent 1** values items: 
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 43
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 55
  - Item 4: 82
  - Item 5: 66

- **Agent 2** values items: 
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 4
  - Item 4: 94
  - Item 5: 41

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Prioritize assigning high-value items to agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (48)
  - Item 3 (39)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 2 (53)
  - Item 5 (66)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 0 (59)
  - Item 4 (94)

This allocation ensures each agent receives some items, and the overall satisfaction is maximized for each agent's high-value items.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
