Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  58  90   0  10  64
1  81   0  43  72  77  80
2  97   4  93  51  84  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[64 58 90  0 10 64]
 [81  0 43 72 77 80]
 [97  4 93 51 84 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to get a sense of their preferences:
   - Agent 0: 64 + 58 + 90 + 0 + 10 + 64 = 286
   - Agent 1: 81 + 0 + 43 + 72 + 77 + 80 = 353
   - Agent 2: 97 + 4 + 93 + 51 + 84 + 31 = 360

2. Consider the highest value items for each agent and allocate them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

3. A potential allocation respecting fairness and preferences could be:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 90, highest for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 97, highest for Agent 2).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 84, second highest for Agent 2).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 80, highest for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 72, second highest for Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 58, second highest for Agent 0 after item 2).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and each item is assigned to the agent who values it significantly, leading to overall fairness.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
