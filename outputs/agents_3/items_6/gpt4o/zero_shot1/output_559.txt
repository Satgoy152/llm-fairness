Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  84  11  62  14  95
1  42  99  35  90  76  52
2  34  10   4  93  10  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 99 35 90 76 52]
 [34 10  4 93 10 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and try to balance the allocations to ensure fairness.

2. Consider the valuations provided:

   - Agent 0: [45, 84, 11, 62, 14, 95]
   - Agent 1: [42, 99, 35, 90, 76, 52]
   - Agent 2: [34, 10,  4, 93, 10, 69]

3. Prioritize items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

   - Item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (99).
   - Item 5 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (95).
   - Item 3 has high valuations for both Agent 1 (90) and Agent 2 (93).
   - Distribute remaining items based on maximizing the total valuation.

4. Allocate items to maximize fairness:

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items [2, 4]

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and attempts to maximize the overall fairness based on the provided valuations.
