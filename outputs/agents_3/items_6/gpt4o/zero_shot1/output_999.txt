Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  67  75  16  20  96
1  77  96  39  15  55  38
2  84  27  20  70  20  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent given their preferences for the items. We will follow a simple approach to ensure each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is six. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (96), Item 2 (75), Item 1 (67)
   - Allocate: Item 5

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 0 (77), Item 4 (55)
   - Allocate: Item 1, Item 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 3 (70), Item 5 (37)
   - Allocate: Item 3, Item 2, Item 4

Allocating based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and reflects the agentsâ€™ preferences as closely as possible within the constraints.
