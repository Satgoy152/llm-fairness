Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65   1  37  50  40  23
1  46  84  94  62  90  65
2  90  88  60  42  11  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**  
   We want to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items:**  
   Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Ensure Fairness:**  
   If allocations result in one agent receiving no items, redistribute to ensure fairness while trying to respect the highest valuations.

**Allocation Process:**

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 90).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 88).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 94).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 62).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 90).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 65).

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: No items.
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4, 5].
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1].

**Redistribution for Fairness:**
To ensure each agent has at least one item and the distribution is more balanced:
- Reassign item 3 from agent 1 to agent 0 (since agent 0 has a second-highest value for item 3).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items [3].
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 5].
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1].

This ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is reasonably fair based on the highest valuation principle.

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
