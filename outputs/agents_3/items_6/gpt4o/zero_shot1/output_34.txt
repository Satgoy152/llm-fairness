Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  41  75  58  45   1
1  74   8  61   8  87  25
2  20  10  83  45  83  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated equals 6. We will aim to maximize the fairness by considering the valuations provided by each agent for each item.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 2 (75), moderate valuations for items 0 (37) and 1 (41), and lower valuations for the rest.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 (74) and 4 (87), and a moderate valuation for item 2 (61).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 (83), 4 (83), and 5 (95).

An allocation strategy could involve assigning each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring fairness in the total number of items allocated. 

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items they value moderately to highly: [0, 1]
- **Agent 1** gets items they value highly: [4]
- **Agent 2** gets items they value highly: [2, 3, 5]

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 two items that they moderately value.
- Agent 1 one item that they highly value.
- Agent 2 three items they highly value.

This results in each agent receiving a different number of items, reflecting their valuations and maximizing each agent's satisfaction given they receive an integer number of items.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation adheres to the constraints and fairly distributes the items based on the given valuations.
