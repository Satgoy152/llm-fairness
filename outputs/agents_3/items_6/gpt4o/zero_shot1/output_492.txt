Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  76  86  78  11  74
1  72  68  22  46  27  93
2  70  91  74  78  29  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [70 91 74 78 29 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated. Let's go through the valuation table and find a fair distribution:

### Valuation Table:
- Agent 0: [54, 76, 86, 78, 11, 74]
- Agent 1: [72, 68, 22, 46, 27, 93]
- Agent 2: [70, 91, 74, 78, 29, 77]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (86), 3 (78)
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (93), 0 (72)
   - Allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (91), 4 (29)
   - Allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 2

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 items, all items are allocated, and the total valuations are reasonably distributed among the agents.
