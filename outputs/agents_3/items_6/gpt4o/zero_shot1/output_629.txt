Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  16  10  68  80  76
1  30   9  45  48  28  85
2  46  45   1   2  37  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a method that ensures each agent gets high-value items according to their individual preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 3, 4, and 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest and has moderate value for item 3.
3. Agent 2 has moderate values for items 0 and 1.

After analyzing the values, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

This allocation aims to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent based on their given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
