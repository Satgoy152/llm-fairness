Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28   3  31  50  41  12
1  55  11  60   1  17  87
2  66  25  40  44  96   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 11 60  1 17 87]
 [66 25 40 44 96  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. We aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 0, valued at 50.
   - Item 2 is also valuable for Agent 0, valued at 31.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 1, valued at 87.
   - Item 0 is also valuable for Agent 1, valued at 55.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 2, valued at 96.
   - Item 1 is valuable for Agent 2, valued at 25.

Given this strategy, we ensure each agent gets two items and the allocation is balanced. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items based on their valuations, maximizing the perceived value for each agent.
