Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  39  53  99  33  48
1  50  81  88  64  91  11
2  61  70  12  22  56  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total happiness of the agents. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, which assigns each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s how we can apply this:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 50, and Agent 2 at 61. 
   - Assign to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 81, and Agent 2 at 70.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 88, and Agent 2 at 12.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 64, and Agent 2 at 22.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 91, and Agent 2 at 56.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 at 11, and Agent 2 at 19.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
