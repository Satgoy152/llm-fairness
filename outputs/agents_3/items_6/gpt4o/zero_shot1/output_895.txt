Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3  4   5
0  11   5  41  22  2  81
1  80  69   0  90  2   7
2  29  99  85  79  7  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 69  0 90  2  7]
 [29 99 85 79  7 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 81. Allocating item 5 to agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
   - Next, item 2 is valued at 41, which is the second-highest for this agent. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 90. Allocating item 3 to agent 1 satisfies their highest preference.
   - The next highest valued item is item 0 at 80. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 99. Allocating item 1 to agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.
   - The next highest valued item for agent 2 is item 4 at 7. Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize their individual satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
