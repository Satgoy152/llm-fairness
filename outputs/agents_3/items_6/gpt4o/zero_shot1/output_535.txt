Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82   2  77  98  34   7
1  16  55  16  49   8  23
2  17  36  92  11  24  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82  2 77 98 34  7]
 [16 55 16 49  8 23]
 [17 36 92 11 24 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 82, 2, 77, 98, 34, 7
- Agent 1 values: 16, 55, 16, 49, 8, 23
- Agent 2 values: 17, 36, 92, 11, 24, 70

A potential allocation strategy is to assign each agent the items for which they have the highest relative valuation compared to other agents. Here's a breakdown of which agent values each item the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (82)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (55)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (92)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (98)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (24)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (70)

Using this analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation based on the given preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
