Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23   3   5  28   1  57
1  67  63  13  85  23  72
2  20  48  50  70  90  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the valuations provided for each agent, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [23, 3, 5, 28, 1, 57]
   - Highest valued item: 5 (value = 57)
   - Next highest: 3 (value = 28)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [67, 63, 13, 85, 23, 72]
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value = 85)
   - Next highest: 0 (value = 67)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [20, 48, 50, 70, 90, 39]
   - Highest valued item: 4 (value = 90)
   - Next highest: 3 (value = 70)

Considering the highest values, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 2]
- Agent 2 gets items [3, 4]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and the total valuation is maximized for each agent as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

Note: This allocation seeks to fairly distribute items based on the highest valuations, balancing the total value each agent receives. Adjustments might be necessary if the context or fairness criteria change.
