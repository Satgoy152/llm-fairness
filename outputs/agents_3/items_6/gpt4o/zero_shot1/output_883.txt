Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  83  47  55  80  80
1  86  66  37  36  64  58
2  71  58  31  42  28   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 66 37 36 64 58]
 [71 58 31 42 28  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 6.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [12, 83, 47, 55, 80, 80]
- Agent 1: [86, 66, 37, 36, 64, 58]
- Agent 2: [71, 58, 31, 42, 28, 1]

We can follow a strategy that seeks to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items with the highest valuations for Agent 0. The items with the highest values for Agent 0 are 1 (83) and 4 (80).

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items with the highest valuations for Agent 1. The items with the highest values for Agent 1 are 0 (86) and 5 (58).

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with the highest valuations for Agent 2. The items with the highest values for Agent 2 are 2 (31) and 3 (42).

Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 2, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and the total number of allocated items is 6.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
