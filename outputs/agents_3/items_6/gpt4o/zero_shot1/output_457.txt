Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  67  15  80  82  15
1  13  77  23  69  99  69
2  65  57  72  21  61  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 77 23 69 99 69]
 [65 57 72 21 61 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their total valuations, we can employ a strategy where each agent gets items that they value most. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 4. However, item 0 is valued highest by them.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly and it is the highest value for this item across all agents.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 and item 5 highly, and these values are highest compared to other agents.

Let's allocate items step-by-step:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 4).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 5).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (high valuation for item 1, second in line for allocation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation for Agent 1).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total value across all agents is maximized.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
