Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  76  65  25  95  10
1  66  12  40  75  70  17
2  58  23  50  63  39  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, given there are 6 items and 3 agents.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Check valuations to find a fair allocation. We aim for each agent to get a proportionate share of their highest-valued items.

2. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (95), Item 0 (83), Item 1 (76).
   - Assign Item 4 (highest value).

3. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (75), Item 0 (66), Item 4 (70).
   - Assign Item 3 (highest value not yet assigned).

4. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (63), Item 5 (51), Item 2 (50).
   - Assign Item 5 (highest value not yet assigned).

5. **Remaining Items**: Items 0, 1, 2.
   - Assign remaining items aiming to balance the total value received by each agent.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Already has Item 4. Add Item 0 (next highest value for Agent 0) and Item 2 (next highest available).
   - Agent 1: Already has Item 3. Add Item 1 (next highest available).
   - Agent 2: Already has Item 5. Assign no additional items as they have a balanced distribution.

Based on this analysis, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5]
}
```

Each agent has received items in a way that aims to maximize their total valuations while keeping the allocation fair.
