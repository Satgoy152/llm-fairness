Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  25  63  63  67  68
1  73  13  64  89  74   3
2  60  98  27  66  89  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 13 64 89 74  3]
 [60 98 27 66 89 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated. Let's analyze and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:** [14, 25, 63, 63, 67, 68]
2. **Agent 1 Valuations:** [73, 13, 64, 89, 74, 3]
3. **Agent 2 Valuations:** [60, 98, 27, 66, 89, 14]

To maximize fairness, we will try to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 and item 0.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 and item 4.
- Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuations for items 2 and 5.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [2, 5]
- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 2:** Items [1, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation based on their preferences.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This distribution assigns all 6 items, maintains fairness by considering the preferences, and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.
