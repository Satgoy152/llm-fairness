Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  73  47  61  58  87
1   1  34  83  57  84  58
2  38  19  26  59  62  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[56 73 47 61 58 87]
 [ 1 34 83 57 84 58]
 [38 19 26 59 62 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the six items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [56, 73, 47, 61, 58, 87]
- Agent 1: [1, 34, 83, 57, 84, 58]
- Agent 2: [38, 19, 26, 59, 62, 74]

A reasonable approach would be to allocate items to maximize the individual agent's satisfaction, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Letâ€™s allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with high values: 5 (87), 1 (73)
2. **Agent 1**: Items with high values: 4 (84), 2 (83)
3. **Agent 2**: Items with high values: 3 (59), 0 (38)

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 0]

These allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
