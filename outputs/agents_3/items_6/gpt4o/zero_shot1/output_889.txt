Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  85  54  21  28  32
1  86  88  61  29  95  96
2  62  11   3  85  41  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 88 61 29 95 96]
 [62 11  3 85 41 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's evaluate a potential allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0 (value 59), 2 (value 54)
   - Total value for Agent 0: 59 + 54 = 113

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1 (value 88), 4 (value 95), 5 (value 96)
   - Total value for Agent 1: 88 + 95 + 96 = 279

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 3 (value 85)
   - Total value for Agent 2: 85

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed, and it attempts to maximize the value for each agent. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
