Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  70  36  30  61  68
1  60  49  27  31   6  74
2  51  28  49  16  61  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [51 28 49 16 61 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integral number of items.

Let's examine each agent's highest-valued items:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 5: 68

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 5: 74
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 3: 31

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 4: 61
  - Item 5: 61

Now, let's allocate the items such that each agent gets their most valued items while ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate Item 0 (value 84)
   - Allocate Item 1 (value 70)
   - Allocate Item 5 (value 68)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate Item 3 (value 31)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate Item 2 (value 49)
   - Allocate Item 4 (value 61)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their individual item valuations, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
