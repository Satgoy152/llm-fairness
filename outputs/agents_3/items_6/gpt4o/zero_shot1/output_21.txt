Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  91  19  87  23  10
1  17  22  96  63  37  11
2  53  86   8  15  76  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 86  8 15 76 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring every agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 13
- Item 1: 91
- Item 2: 19
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 23
- Item 5: 10

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 96
- Item 3: 63
- Item 4: 37
- Item 5: 11

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 53
- Item 1: 86
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 15
- Item 4: 76
- Item 5: 63

Now, let's identify the optimal allocation by selecting items with the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

1. Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 0 and 4.

Let's assign items based on these priorities:
- Agent 0: Items 1 (91), 3 (87)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (96)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (53), 4 (76), 5 (63)

This allocation provides each agent with an integer number of items while maximizing their total valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
