Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   9  62  50  90  33
1  50  56  25  83  28  11
2  71  48  13  69  23   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [20, 9, 62, 50, 90, 33]
- Agent 1: [50, 56, 25, 83, 28, 11]
- Agent 2: [71, 48, 13, 69, 23, 4]

One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate items based on the highest individual valuations first. However, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share, which typically means one or two items each in this case, given that there are three agents and six items in total.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 0 (90). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3** is highly valued by Agent 1 (83). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 2 (71). Allocate to Agent 2.
4. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 0 (62). Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 1 (56). Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5** is left for Agent 2, though it has low valuation for them (4). Allocate to Agent 2.

After this allocation strategy, each agent receives two items in total:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]

The allocations minimize dissatisfaction by distributing items in a way that respects the strongest preferences under the constraint that each agent receives a fair share.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable number of items and attempts to maximize their total perceived value based on their individual valuations.
