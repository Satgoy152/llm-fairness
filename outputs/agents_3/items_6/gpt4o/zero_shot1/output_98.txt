Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  52   3  88  73  58
1  26  62  29  67  73  53
2  27  28  98   7  29  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent, considering their valuations. One straightforward way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm. We can assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Analyze the Valuations:**

   | Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
   |-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | 0     | 52     | 52     | 3      | 88     | 73     | 58     |
   | 1     | 26     | 62     | 29     | 67     | 73     | 53     |
   | 2     | 27     | 28     | 98     | 7      | 29     | 96     |

2. **Determine Optimal Allocation:**

   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the highest (52).
   - **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the highest (62).
   - **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the highest (98).
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it the highest (88).
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it equally (73). To balance the allocation, we give it to Agent 1.
   - **Item 5:** Agent 2 values it the highest (96).

3. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 2 gets items 2 and 5.

4. **JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value while distributing the items evenly.
