Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  94  12  29  19  95
1  89   2  51  45  43  50
2  48  30  51  91  59  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's analyze the values:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 88
- Item 1: 94
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 19
- Item 5: 95

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 2
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 45
- Item 4: 43
- Item 5: 50

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 51
- Item 3: 91
- Item 4: 59
- Item 5: 68

Given these values, we aim to allocate the items to maximize the fairness of the distribution. One approach is to allocate the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring that every agent gets at least one item.

A possible fair allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5 (values 94 and 95)
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2 (values 89 and 51)
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4 (values 91 and 59)

This ensures each agent gets two items, and the allocations are as balanced as possible given their valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
