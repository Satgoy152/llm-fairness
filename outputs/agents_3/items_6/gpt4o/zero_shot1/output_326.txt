Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  26  53  19   8  20
1  86  54  44  65  16  32
2  76  87  43  18  42  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 54 44 65 16 32]
 [76 87 43 18 42 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given that the number of items (6) equals the number of agents (3).

### Step 1: Analyze Valuations
Let's first list the valuations for each agent and item:

- Agent 0: [56, 26, 53, 19, 8, 20]
- Agent 1: [86, 54, 44, 65, 16, 32]
- Agent 2: [76, 87, 43, 18, 42, 49]

### Step 2: Allocate Items
To ensure each agent receives items fairly and maximize their total valuations, we can aim for the highest possible valuation for each agent. 

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 0 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 1 and 5.

### Step 3: Assign Items
We need to ensure no conflicts in assigning high-value items to multiple agents. Let's make a fair allocation based on individual maximums while ensuring each agent has at least one item.

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

This ensures each agent has at least one item, and we distribute items to maximize the overall satisfaction based on given valuations.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.
