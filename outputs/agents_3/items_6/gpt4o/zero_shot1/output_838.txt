Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  68  90   1  44  30
1  39  19  27   9  18   1
2  15   5  90  10  12  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15  5 90 10 12 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has relatively low valuations across all items. Assign the lowest valued items from Agent 0's perspective to Agent 1, which are items 3 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 2 (although it's already assigned to Agent 0), so assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it has the next highest valuation for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we consider the overall efficiency based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
