Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  23  92  94  44  82
1  99  99  52  67  91  45
2  85  81  52  58  39  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 99 52 67 91 45]
 [85 81 52 58 39 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (94).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 0 (99) and 4 (91).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 5 (93) and 2 (92).

Let's distribute the remaining items by comparing valuations and ensuring fairness:

- Item 1: Agent 1 has a valuation of 99, which is the highest.

With this allocation, each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is six.
