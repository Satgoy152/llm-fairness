Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  57  68  96   6  27
1  54  88  36  68  62  59
2  48  48  68   0   4  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the value each agent places on the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 96.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 88.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 62.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it at 68, which is the same as agent 0's valuation, but agent 0 already has two items.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 62, which is the highest among the remaining unallocated items.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it at 26, which is the highest among the remaining unallocated items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
