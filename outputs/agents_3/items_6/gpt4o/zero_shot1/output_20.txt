Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  15  45  51  51  47
1  23  66  98  67  87  49
2  79  94  57  63  32  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 66 98 67 87 49]
 [79 94 57 63 32 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [35, 15, 45, 51, 51, 47]
   - Highest value items: 3, 4, 5 (51, 51, 47)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [23, 66, 98, 67, 87, 49]
   - Highest value items: 2, 4, 3 (98, 87, 67)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [79, 94, 57, 63, 32, 22]
   - Highest value items: 1, 0, 3 (94, 79, 63)

**Proposed allocation:**

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (one of the highest values for Agent 0)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their overall valuations.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
