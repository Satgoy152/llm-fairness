Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  69   4  89  17  44
1  97  67  54  33  40  12
2  35  64  49   1   4  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 64 49  1  4 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share.

Let's analyze the table:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 4
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 17
- Item 5: 44

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 97
- Item 1: 67
- Item 2: 54
- Item 3: 33
- Item 4: 40
- Item 5: 12

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 35
- Item 1: 64
- Item 2: 49
- Item 3: 1
- Item 4: 4
- Item 5: 14

Considering these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (97), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (89), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 0 also values Item 1 highly (69), and no other agent values it more, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (49), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
5. Agent 1 values Item 4 the most (40), so we allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 0 values Item 5 the most (44), so we allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest valuations as much as possible.
