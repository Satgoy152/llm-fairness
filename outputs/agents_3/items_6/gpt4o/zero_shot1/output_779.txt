Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  84  44   1  48  93
1  54  88   6  97  51  68
2  55  50  39  22   5  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 88  6 97 51 68]
 [55 50 39 22  5 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least some value from the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: It seems reasonable to allocate item 5 to agent 0 since they value it highly (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 seems optimal for agent 1 as they value it at 97.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 0 is a good choice for agent 2 since they value it at 55.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**: Item 1 is highly valued by agent 0 (84), so it can be allocated to them.
5. **Agent 1**: Item 4 can be given to agent 1 because they value it at 51.
6. **Agent 2**: Finally, item 2 can be allocated to agent 2 since they value it at 39.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
