Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  84   7  14  45  79
1  89  80   2  58  55  99
2  53  82  84  72  89  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 82 84 72 89 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Consider the highest valuations and allocate accordingly, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. Ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's analyze the valuations to allocate items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (84) and item 5 (79).
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5 (99) and item 0 (89).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4 (89) and item 2 (84).

Given these observations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3 (valuations: 84, 14) for a total of 98.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5 (valuations: 89, 99) for a total of 188.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 4 (valuations: 84, 89) for a total of 173.

This allocation ensures a balance of total valuations and assigns all items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
