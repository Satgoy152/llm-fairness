Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32   6  73  22  70  86
1  65  89  64  23  52  34
2  55  36  46  19  74  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. There are multiple ways to achieve a fair allocation, but one common approach is to use the method of maximizing the sum of values for each agent while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 22
  - Item 4: 70
  - Item 5: 86

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 52
  - Item 5: 34

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 19
  - Item 4: 74
  - Item 5: 16

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. For Item 0, Agent 1 has the highest valuation (65).
2. For Item 1, Agent 1 also has the highest valuation (89).
3. For Item 2, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (73).
4. For Item 3, Agent 1 has the highest valuation (23).
5. For Item 4, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (74).
6. For Item 5, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (86).

Based on these valuations, the allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
