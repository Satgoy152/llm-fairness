Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  64  79  76  85  82
1  82  34   9  71  88   4
2  13  38  78   8  45   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 64 79 76 85 82]
 [82 34  9 71 88  4]
 [13 38 78  8 45  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items based on maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We'll use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on who values them the most.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [29, 64, 79, 76, 85, 82]
Agent 1: [82, 34,  9, 71, 88,  4]
Agent 2: [13, 38, 78,  8, 45,  7]
```

Let's assign the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 82 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 64 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 79 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 76 by Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 88 by Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 82 by Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items [1, 2, 3, 5].
- Agent 1 has items [0, 4].
- Agent 2 has no items. 

To adjust, we will reallocate one item from Agent 0 to Agent 2, choosing an item that Agent 2 values relatively high while minimizing the impact on Agent 0. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest among unallocated items, but item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0. Instead, allocating item 5 to Agent 2, which has a relatively lower value for Agent 0.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [5]

Final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
