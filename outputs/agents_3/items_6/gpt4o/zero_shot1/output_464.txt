Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64   9   9  59  34  70
1  60  21  67   4  61  55
2  77  48  73  44  24  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that all agents are satisfied with their allocations based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step reasoning to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly (70).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly (67).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 highly (73) and item 0 highly (77).

2. **Determine Initial Allocations:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valuation.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is one of their highest valuations and Agent 2 already has a high valuation item.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valuation.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1, 3, and 4 remain.
   - Item 4 can go to Agent 1 (valued at 61) because Agent 1 values it significantly and it's not highly valued by the others.
   - Item 3 can go to Agent 0, who values it at 59, which is higher than the valuation by Agent 1 or Agent 2.
   - Item 1 can go to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it higher than Agent 0.

4. **Check Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 4
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 1

The above allocation ensures each agent receives items that they value relatively higher compared to the other agents, aiming for fairness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
