Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  88  26  58  64  99
1  26  17  79  33  32  83
2   3  68  25  53  82  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 68 25 53 82 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agentâ€™s valuations and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items and try to distribute items such that each agent gets approximately equal value.

Let's see a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [79, 88, 26, 58, 64, 99]
- Agent 1 values: [26, 17, 79, 33, 32, 83]
- Agent 2 values: [3, 68, 25, 53, 82, 52]

Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.

Proposed allocation:
- Assign item 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for this item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation for this item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation and balances Agent 0's total value.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, balancing the total allocation more evenly.

Here's the json format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
