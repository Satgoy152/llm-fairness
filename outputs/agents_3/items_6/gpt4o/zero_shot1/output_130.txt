Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  43  73  29  59  93
1  89  13  71  71  17  19
2  43  14  28  64  77  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 13 71 71 17 19]
 [43 14 28 64 77 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a distribution where each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's calculate potential allocations based on the given valuations to ensure a fair distribution while maximizing individual agent satisfaction.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values for Agent 0 are items 5 (value 93) and 0 (value 81).
   - Assign items 5 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - After Agent 0's allocation, remaining highest values for Agent 1 are items 3 (value 71) and 2 (value 71).
   - Assign items 3 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Remaining items are 1 and 4. Agent 2's highest available values are item 4 (value 77) and item 1 (value 14).
   - Assign items 4 and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and all items are allocated. Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
