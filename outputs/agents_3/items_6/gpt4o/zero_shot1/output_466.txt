Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  82  56  86  68   0
1  65  15  72  45  68  82
2  65  89  25  65  56  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach: each agent should receive items that maximize their individual value while ensuring every item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Let's consider the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  82  56  86  68   0
1  65  15  72  45  68  82
2  65  89  25  65  56  20
```

We want to make sure that each agent gets the best possible allocation under the constraint that all items must be assigned. 

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 38, 82, 56, 86, 68, 0
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** 65, 15, 72, 45, 68, 82
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** 65, 89, 25, 65, 56, 20

To maximize fairness, we can allocate items by checking which items have the highest value to each agent, then ensuring each item is only assigned once.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Gets item 3 (value 86, highest for Agent 0)
  - Gets item 1 (value 82, second highest for Agent 0, after item 3)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Gets item 5 (value 82, highest for Agent 1)
  - Gets item 2 (value 72, second highest for Agent 1, after item 5)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Gets item 0 (value 65, highest available for Agent 2)
  - Gets item 4 (value 56, second highest available for Agent 2)

Thus, the final allocation ensuring each item is allocated once, and maximizing individual agent valuations, is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's valuation priorities and ensures the distribution is completed fairly with all six items assigned.
