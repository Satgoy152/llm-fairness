Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  10  97  71  53  36
1  44  28  48  64  10  44
2  63  10  48  74  16  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One way to do this is by considering each agent's highest valued items and attempting to assign those items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 3:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value of 97).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value of 71).

2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 3, but since it's already taken, we look for the next best:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value of 44).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value of 44).

3. **Agent 2** remains, and we allocate the remaining items to them:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value of 10).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value of 16).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
