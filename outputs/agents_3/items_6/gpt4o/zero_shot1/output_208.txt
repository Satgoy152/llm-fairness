Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  73  96  49  93  77
1  33  23  89  72   6  70
2  60  46   2   9   6  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 23 89 72  6 70]
 [60 46  2  9  6 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we will proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - The highest valuations are for items 2 (96), 4 (93), and 5 (77).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - The highest valuations are for items 2 (89), 3 (72), and 5 (70).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The highest valuations are for items 5 (68), 0 (60), and 1 (46).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

At this point, each agent has at least one item, and we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 4.

4. Consider the remaining items:
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it highest at 75.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it highest at 73.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it highest at 93.

Assign the remaining items to maximize total valuations:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an item while maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
