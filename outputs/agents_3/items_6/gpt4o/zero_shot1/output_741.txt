Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  57  22   2  36  10
1   5  22  95  83  32  50
2  86  53  18  82  40  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction or value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [83, 57, 22, 2, 36, 10]
   - Highest values are for items 0 and 1.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [5, 22, 95, 83, 32, 50]
   - Highest values are for items 2 and 3.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [86, 53, 18, 82, 40, 73]
   - Highest values are for items 0 and 5, but item 0 has already been fairly allocated to Agent 0, so items 5 and 4 can be considered.

Based on this evaluation, we can assign items to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 5.

This allocation attempts to give each agent the items they value the most, given the constraints.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
