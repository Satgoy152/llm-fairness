Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  60  74  38  65  40
1  63  33  61  77  35  76
2  67  54  13   0  37  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's go through the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0 are item 2 (value of 74), item 4 (value of 65), and item 1 (value of 60). 
   - Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1 are item 3 (value of 77), item 5 (value of 76), and item 0 (value of 63).
   - Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2 are item 0 (value of 67), item 1 (value of 54), and item 4 (value of 37).
   - Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while considering the preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate item 1 (value 60 for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 4 (value 65 for Agent 0).

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 5 (value 76 for Agent 1).

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.
