Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  24  38  94  23   7
1  44  46  20   3  31  56
2  59  79  13  49  41  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 46 20  3 31 56]
 [59 79 13 49 41 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (94), so they get item 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (56), so they get item 5.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (79), so they get item 1.

Now we have items 0, 2, and 4 remaining:

4. Agent 0 values item 0 the second highest (58), so they get item 0.
5. Agent 2 values item 4 more than agent 1 (41 vs 31), so they get item 4.
6. Finally, item 2 is left, and agent 0 values it more than agent 2 (38 vs 13), so agent 0 gets item 2.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
