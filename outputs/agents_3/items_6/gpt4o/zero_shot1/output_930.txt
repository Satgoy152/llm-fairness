Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7   3  66  36  12  54
1  73  70  25  34  65  88
2   9  11  47  66   2   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 70 25 34 65 88]
 [ 9 11 47 66  2  6]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items. One common approach is to use a method called "Max-Min Fairness," where we try to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives. Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: 7, 3, 66, 36, 12, 54
- Agent 1: 73, 70, 25, 34, 65, 88
- Agent 2: 9, 11, 47, 66, 2, 6

### Total Items:
6 items to allocate.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. First, sort each agent's valuations and identify the highest value items for each agent.
2. Assign items in a way that tries to balance the overall value received by each agent.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest at 88. We assign item 5 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest at 66. We assign item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest at 66. We assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** values item 0 the second highest at 73. We assign item 0 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** values item 4 the next highest at 12. We assign item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values item 1 at 70. This is still higher than Agent 2's highest remaining valuation. We assign item 1 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3

This allocation tries to balance the highest values for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
