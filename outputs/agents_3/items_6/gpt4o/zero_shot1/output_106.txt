Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  93  29  32  73  81
1  60  95  54   6  96  36
2  49   8  89  46  36  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49  8 89 46 36 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple greedy approach. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least some items. We'll allocate items to agents one by one based on the highest value they assign to the remaining available items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 96, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
2. Next, agent 1 values item 1 at 95, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 5 at 81, so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
4. Agent 2 values item 2 at 89, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
5. Agent 0 values item 0 at 21, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
6. Agent 2 values item 3 at 46, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with a reasonable attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
