Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  53   3  24  44  95
1   2  82  61  12   4  46
2  16  60  81  71  44   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [16 60 81 71 44  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent gets. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get if they were assigned each item.
2. Try to allocate items to agents in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  53   3  24  44  95
1   2  82  61  12   4  46
2  16  60  81  71  44   6
```

Let's go through a potential allocation:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for this agent (95).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it has the highest value for this agent (82).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it has the highest value for this agent (81).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has the second-highest value for this agent (71).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2, as it provides some value and helps balance the total values (16).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0, as it is more beneficial than giving it to the others (44).

Based on this approach, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation is fairly balanced given the valuations and ensures all items are allocated.
