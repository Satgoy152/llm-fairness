Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  23  63  47  95  46
1  31  20   2   2  64  87
2  30  56  86   8  82  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 20  2  2 64 87]
 [30 56 86  8 82 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items are 4 (95) and 2 (63).
   - Allocate items 4 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining highest value items for Agent 1 are 5 (87) and 4 (64), but item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items are 2 (86) and 4 (82), but item 2 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Review Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0, 1, and 3 are left unallocated.
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (51).
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (56).
   - Agent 0 has a reasonable value for item 3 (47).

5. **Finalize Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, the allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1

Here is the JSON format for these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
