Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  25  91  99  30  92
1  11  70  37  53  55  37
2  98  65  86  67  43  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 25 91 99 30 92]
 [11 70 37 53 55 37]
 [98 65 86 67 43 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. We ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all six items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [83, 25, 91, 99, 30, 92]  
Agent 1's valuations: [11, 70, 37, 53, 55, 37]  
Agent 2's valuations: [98, 65, 86, 67, 43, 42]  

By considering the highest valuations for each agent, we can attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 5. Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them a total valuation of 99 + 92 = 191.
2. Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 1. Allocating this item to Agent 1 gives them a total valuation of 70.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 2. Allocating these items to Agent 2 gives them a total valuation of 98 + 86 = 184.
4. Item 4 is left, and Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for it at 55.

Let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5] with valuations [99, 92] = 191
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4] with valuations [70, 55] = 125
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2] with valuations [98, 86] = 184

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The JSON representation of the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
