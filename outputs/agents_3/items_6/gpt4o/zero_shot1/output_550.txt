Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  71  70   8  86  96
1  79  49  32  66   1   2
2  23  50  70  81   2  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79 49 32 66  1  2]
 [23 50 70 81  2 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [12, 71, 70, 8, 86, 96]
   - Best items by value: Item 5 (96), Item 4 (86)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [79, 49, 32, 66, 1, 2]
   - Best items by value: Item 0 (79), Item 3 (66)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [23, 50, 70, 81, 2, 99]
   - Best items by value: Item 5 (99), Item 3 (81)

Considering that each agent should get at least one item, let's allocate the items as follows:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 since it has the highest value for them (99).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 with the highest value (79).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 with the highest feasible value (86).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 since the next highest value (71).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 as it is their second-highest (81).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since they still need an item, and it's their next highest value (32).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
