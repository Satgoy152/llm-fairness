Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  86  49  55  67  74
1  23  85  78  33  37  52
2  30  79  44  48  27  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 79 44 48 27 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for all agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items to agents based on who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (30).
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (86).
- Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (78).
- Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (55).
- Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (67).
- Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (84).

Allocations based on the highest value:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6. 

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
