Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  64   4  92  21  19
1   1  33  20  40  85  81
2  81  79  61  15  36  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 79 61 15 36 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2), we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize their total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate items considering the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest with a value of 92. We will allocate item 3 to agent 0.
   - The next highest valued item for agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 64. We will allocate item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest with a value of 85. We will allocate item 4 to agent 1.
   - The next highest valued item for agent 1 is item 5 with a value of 81. We will allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest with a value of 81. We will allocate item 0 to agent 2.
   - The next highest valued item for agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 61. We will allocate item 2 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total number of allocated items is six.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
