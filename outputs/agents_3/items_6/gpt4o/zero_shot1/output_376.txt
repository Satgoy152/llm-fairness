Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  78  32   2  74  61
1  98  71  19  13  92  92
2  81  39  57  46  46  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction while ensuring an equitable distribution. This can be tackled using a balanced approach to ensure all agents get approximately equal value from their assigned items. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Start by evaluating the highest value each agent has for the items and assign those high-value items first if possible.
2. Check for remaining items and distribute them to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5.

Now, let's allocate these items first:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2.

Remaining items are 2, 3, and 4. Now, let's allocate remaining items:

- Agent 0: Consider items 2, 3, and 4. Assign item 4 (value 74, highest remaining for agent 0).
- Agent 1: Consider items 2, 3. Assign item 3 (value 13, not high but it balances the allocation).
- Agent 2: Assign item 2 (value 57, best choice remaining for agent 2).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their values, and all items are allocated.
