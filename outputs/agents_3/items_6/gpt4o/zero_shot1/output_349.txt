Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  20  98  24  24   6
1  89  44  73  78  64  26
2  75  16  86  16  73  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their preferences as indicated by their valuation scores. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 6 items being allocated.

Here is one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a score of 98, higher than any allocation value for other agents on this item.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a score of 89, which is the highest score for item 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the second most after agent 0, but since item 2 is already allocated to agent 0, we look at agent 2's next highest valuation which is item 4 with a score of 73.
4. For the remaining items, we can consider secondary preferences and distribute them to balance the overall allocations.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2. 
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 4, 1, and 5.

This way, each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences and the total of 6 items is allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
