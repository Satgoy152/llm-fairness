Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  96  93  17  89  82
1  16  46  62  31  33  53
2  94  32   7  90  75  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 32  7 90 75 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can look to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. One possible way to allocate items is by evaluating which agent values each item the most and assigning that item to that agent.

Here's a step-by-step process to make the allocations:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 69.
   - Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Agent 2 values it at 94. 
   - **Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.**

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Agent 1 values it at 46.
   - Agent 2 values it at 32.
   - **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.**

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 93.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Agent 2 values it at 7.
   - **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.**

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 17.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Agent 2 values it at 90.
   - **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.**

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 89.
   - Agent 1 values it at 33.
   - Agent 2 values it at 75.
   - **Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.**

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 82.
   - Agent 1 values it at 53.
   - Agent 2 values it at 53.
   - **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.**

Given these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 3.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
