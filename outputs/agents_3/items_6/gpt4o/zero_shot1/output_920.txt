Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  86  29  19  97  81
1  22  97  83   3  13  74
2  28  96  23  32  38  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 86 29 19 97 81]
 [22 97 83  3 13 74]
 [28 96 23 32 38 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's analyze the table first:

- Agent 0's valuations: [92, 86, 29, 19, 97, 81]
- Agent 1's valuations: [22, 97, 83, 3, 13, 74]
- Agent 2's valuations: [28, 96, 23, 32, 38, 60]

We want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. One common approach is to use a method that maximizes the sum of the valuations each agent receives. Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0 (Valuation of 92)
  - Item 4 (Valuation of 97)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 1 (Valuation of 97)
  - Item 2 (Valuation of 83)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 3 (Valuation of 32)
  - Item 5 (Valuation of 60)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations and maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
