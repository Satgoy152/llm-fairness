Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  96   5   0  23  69
1  65  79  85  89  69  23
2  27  45  73  79  36   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations given and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

One approach is to use a method that ensures no agent envies another agent's allocation by too much, often referred to as an envy-free allocation. In this case, given the relatively small number of agents and items, we can manually allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so we can give them item 1.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so they can have item 3.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so we can give them item 2.
- To further balance, we can give agent 0 item 0.
- Agent 1 can also receive item 4.
- Agent 2 can receive item 5.

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute based on the values given:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1 (value: 76 + 96 = 172).
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4 (value: 89 + 69 = 158).
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 5 (value: 73 + 3 = 76).

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
