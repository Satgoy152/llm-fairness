Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60   5  61  43  51   7
1   2  81  86  87  94  40
2  24  60  58  61  85  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60  5 61 43 51  7]
 [ 2 81 86 87 94 40]
 [24 60 58 61 85 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. This problem is a variant of the assignment problem, where we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations of the items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [60, 5, 61, 43, 51, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 81, 86, 87, 94, 40]
- Agent 2: [24, 60, 58, 61, 85, 41]

Let's attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent and ensures each agent has at least one item:

1. **Agent 1** has high values for items 3 and 4, so we allocate these items to Agent 1: [3, 4].
2. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0: [2]. Additionally, Agent 0 has a relatively high value for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0: [0, 2].
3. **Agent 2** has a relatively high value for item 5 and item 1, so we allocate items 5 and 1 to Agent 2: [1, 5].

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items while maximizing their total value based on their preferences.
