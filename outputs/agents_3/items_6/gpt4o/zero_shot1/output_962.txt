Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  57  36  58  56  87
1  83  93  56  38  10  56
2  36  61  24  53  38  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We can try to maximize the total valuation of items for each agent while keeping the allocation balanced.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations for items: 5 (87), 3 (58), 1 (57)
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations for items: 1 (93), 0 (83), 2 (56)
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations for items: 5 (83), 1 (61), 3 (53)

To balance the distribution fairly, let's assign:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and all items are distributed. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
