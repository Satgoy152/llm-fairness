Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  65  60  29  27  37
1  49  70  48   2  21  61
2  67  45  41   0  79  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. We can allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly, but it's already allocated. The next best items for agent 1 are 5 and 2. We allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 4. We allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated four items, and two are left. We need to allocate two more items, ensuring each agent gets items based on maximizing their valuations:

4. **Remaining Items**: Items 2 and 3 are left.

   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 60, which is higher than any other agent's value for item 2. We allocate item 2 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 2, but it's the least valued item. Agent 0 and 2 have better options, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2, since agent 2 values item 3 at 0, and agent 0 values it at 29, but agent 0 already has items.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring a fair distribution of items among the agents.
