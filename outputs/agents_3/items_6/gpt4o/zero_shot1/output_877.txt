Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  19  56  48   1  81
1   2  82  22  14  19  91
2  79  90  78  99  73   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. The goal is to distribute the items such that the sum of each agent's valuations of their allocated items is as high as possible while ensuring fairness in the allocation.

Given the valuations, we can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, then proceed to allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 81).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 82).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 99).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Already received item 5. The next highest value item for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 78).
- Agent 1: Already received item 1. The next highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5, but it is already taken by Agent 0. The next highest available item is item 2 (value 22).
- Agent 2: Already received item 3. The next highest value item for Agent 2 is item 1, but it is already taken by Agent 1. The next highest available item is item 4 (value 73).

This leaves us with item 2 and item 4. Since item 2 is higher valued for Agent 1 than for Agent 0, Agent 1 receives item 2. Thus, Agent 0 receives item 4.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
