Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  78  66  71  29  59
1  97  87   6  13  93  65
2  18  84  13  63  47  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 78 66 71 29 59]
 [97 87  6 13 93 65]
 [18 84 13 63 47 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation each agent has for their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [13, 78, 66, 71, 29, 59]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [97, 87, 6, 13, 93, 65]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [18, 84, 13, 63, 47, 34]

We want to allocate a total of 6 items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they have a high valuation of 87 for it.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because they have a high valuation of 63 for it.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because they have a high valuation of 93 for it.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because they have a high valuation of 97 for it.
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because they have a high valuation of 66 for it.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 because they have a high valuation of 59 for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 6.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
