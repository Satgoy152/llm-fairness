Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  14  55  65  49  52
1  98  19  90  39  43  30
2  85  60  61  27  73  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 60 61 27 73 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, let's consider the valuations and aim to maximize overall satisfaction. We can use a simple greedy approach: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 

Here is how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27
   - Agent 1 values it at 98
   - Agent 2 values it at 85
   - Assign to Agent 1 (value 98)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 19
   - Agent 2 values it at 60
   - Assign to Agent 2 (value 60)

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 90
   - Agent 2 values it at 61
   - Assign to Agent 1 (value 90)

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - Agent 2 values it at 27
   - Assign to Agent 0 (value 65)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 43
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Assign to Agent 2 (value 73)

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 87
   - Assign to Agent 2 (value 87)

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations for the items.
