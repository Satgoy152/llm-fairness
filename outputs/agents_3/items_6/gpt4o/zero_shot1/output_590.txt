Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  89  56  58  12  87
1  55   8  95  29  47  79
2  85  80  35  20   4  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55  8 95 29 47 79]
 [85 80 35 20  4 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is roughly balanced. Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High value on items: 0 (85), 1 (89), 5 (87)
   - Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to maximize their value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High value on items: 2 (95), 5 (79)
   - Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1 to maximize their value.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High value on items: 0 (85), 5 (84)
   - Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2 to maximize their value.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

4. **Remaining Items (3, 4, 5):**
   - Agent 0 has already received item 1.
   - Agent 1 has already received item 2.
   - Agent 2 has already received item 0.

5. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 29, Agent 2 at 20.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

6. **Allocate Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 47, Agent 2 at 4.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

7. **Allocate Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 79, Agent 2 at 84.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above reasoning, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and aims to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.
