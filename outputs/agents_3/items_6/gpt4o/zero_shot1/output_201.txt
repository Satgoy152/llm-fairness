Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  64  93  20  24  38
1  17  76  72  42  52  46
2  64  49  42  22  75  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 49 42 22 75 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2 has the highest value for agent 0 at 93.
   - Item 0 is the next highest for agent 0 at 83.
   - Item 1 is also valuable for agent 0 at 64.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 has a high value for agent 1 at 76 but has been allocated to agent 0.
   - Item 2 has a high value for agent 1 at 72 but has been allocated to agent 0.
   - Item 4 is next highest for agent 1 at 52.
   - Item 5 is also valuable for agent 1 at 46.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 has the highest value for agent 2 at 75 but has been allocated to agent 1.
   - Item 0 has a good value for agent 2 at 64 but has been allocated to agent 0.
   - Item 1 has a value for agent 2 at 49 but has been allocated to agent 0.
   - Item 5 is next highest for agent 2 at 29.

Considering the above valuations and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 1 to agent 0.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed with a focus on maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
