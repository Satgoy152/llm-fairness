Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  20  94  18  15  22
1  32  61  58   7  52   8
2  48  97  20  78  86  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to distribute items in a way that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.

To ensure fairness, each agent will receive at least one item with relatively high valuation from their perspective. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 4) to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0 still needs items. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 since they value it the highest among the remaining items.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4 compared to agent 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 can be given item 3 to balance the allocation.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 3]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
