Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  22  90  72  27  41
1  50  44  83  60  65  24
2  76   9  48  92  50  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Item 2 (90), Item 3 (72).
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 (excluding already allocated items): Item 0 (50), Item 4 (65).
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 (excluding already allocated items): Item 3 was the highest but is already allocated, so next are Item 0 (76) and Item 5 (27). However, Item 0 is allocated to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2. Item 1 is the next highest available value for Agent 2 (9).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and tries to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
