Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  38  38  69   7  74
1  57  33  70  68  24   1
2  13  63   4  76  51  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value = 74).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value = 70).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value = 76).

2. **Allocate the highest value items to each agent**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items by considering remaining high-value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Remaining high-value items are 3 (69) and 0 (63).
   - Agent 1: Remaining high-value items are 3 (68) and 0 (57).
   - Agent 2: Remaining high-value items are 5 (69) and 1 (63).

4. **Assign remaining items based on the highest available value for the agents**:
   - Item 0 is valued at 63 by Agent 0 and 57 by Agent 1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is valued at 63 by Agent 2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Item 4 is valued at 51 by Agent 2. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated all 6 items. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total value for each agent is maximized based on their preferences.
