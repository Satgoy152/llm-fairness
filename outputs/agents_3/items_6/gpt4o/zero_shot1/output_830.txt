Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  71   4  26  68  76
1  49  24  95  86   1  40
2  78  26  26  67  74  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 71  4 26 68 76]
 [49 24 95 86  1 40]
 [78 26 26 67 74 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. We will use the given valuations to make these decisions:

Agent 0's valuations: [32, 71, 4, 26, 68, 76]
Agent 1's valuations: [49, 24, 95, 86, 1, 40]
Agent 2's valuations: [78, 26, 26, 67, 74, 26]

One approach is to assign items such that the total value is maximized for all agents. We will assign items based on which agent values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 2 has the highest value (95) for Agent 1.
2. Item 0 has the highest value (78) for Agent 2.
3. Item 5 has the highest value (76) for Agent 0.
4. Item 1 has the highest value (71) for Agent 0.
5. Item 3 has the highest value (86) for Agent 1.
6. Item 4 has the highest value (74) for Agent 2.

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 items, which is as balanced as possible with 6 items and 3 agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
