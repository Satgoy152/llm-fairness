Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  58  33  73  94  96
1  87  53  88  89  76  52
2  10  52  23  60  64  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 53 88 89 76 52]
 [10 52 23 60 64 44]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's evaluate the best allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (96), Item 4 (94), Item 3 (73)
   - Let's allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (89), Item 2 (88), Item 0 (87)
   - Let's allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (64), Item 3 (60), Item 1 (52)
   - Let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (Items 0, 1, and 2):

- **Agent 0:** Already has Item 5.
- **Agent 1:** Already has Item 3.
- **Agent 2:** Already has Item 4.

Let's continue allocating:

4. **Remaining Items: 0, 1, 2**

   - Agent 0: Allocate Item 0 (37)
   - Agent 1: Allocate Item 2 (88)
   - Agent 2: Allocate Item 1 (52)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
