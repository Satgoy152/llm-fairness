Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  10  36  24   3  47
1  62  60  19  96  73  92
2  29  63  33  95  79  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 64 + 10 + 36 + 24 + 3 + 47 = 184
   - Agent 1: 62 + 60 + 19 + 96 + 73 + 92 = 402
   - Agent 2: 29 + 63 + 33 + 95 + 79 + 55 = 354

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Valuation:**
   - Start with the highest valuation for each agent and assign items accordingly, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of high-value items.

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (64), Item 5 (47)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (96), Item 5 (92) - already taken, so next highest is Item 4 (73)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (95) - already taken, so next highest is Item 4 (79), Item 1 (63)

4. **Adjust to Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent and each agent gets a fair distribution.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 0, Item 2
   - Agent 1: Item 3, Item 5
   - Agent 2: Item 1, Item 4

6. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Double-check that each item is allocated once and all items are used.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
