Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  83  91  59  10  74
1  94  88  28  49  46  78
2  87   6  52   8  45  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations for Agent 0 are: Item 2 (91), Item 1 (83), and Item 5 (74).
   - We'll assign Item 2 (91) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations for Agent 1 are: Item 0 (94), Item 1 (88), and Item 5 (78).
   - We'll assign Item 0 (94) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations for Agent 2 are: Item 0 (87), Item 2 (52), and Item 5 (39).
   - We'll assign Item 5 (39) to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 1, 3, and 4 are still unallocated. We will assign these to balance the allocations, considering remaining valuations.

5. **Balancing Allocation**:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 88) since Agent 1 had a high valuation for it.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 59) as it is valuable to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value 45) for better distribution among agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items fairly among the agents based on their highest valuations for the remaining items.
