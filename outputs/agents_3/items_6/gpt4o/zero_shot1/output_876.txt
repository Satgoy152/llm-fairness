Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  50  64  12  30  49
1  12  48  63  80   7   7
2  84  80  59  80  78  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 48 63 80  7  7]
 [84 80 59 80 78 36]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [12, 50, 64, 12, 30, 49]
- Agent 1 values: [12, 48, 63, 80, 7, 7]
- Agent 2 values: [84, 80, 59, 80, 78, 36]

We want to allocate items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One way to approach this is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with that strategy:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Agent 2 values it at 84 (highest value)
   - Assign to Agent 2

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 50
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 80 (highest value)
   - Assign to Agent 2

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 80
   - Assign to Agent 1 (tie resolved by assigning to Agent 1)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Agent 2 values it at 78 (highest value)
   - Assign to Agent 2

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Agent 2 values it at 36
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value)

After this allocation, we have the following distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 3
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 1, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
