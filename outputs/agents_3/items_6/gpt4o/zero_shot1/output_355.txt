Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  62  56  27  19  49
1  93  14  46  17  38  64
2  10  52  16   3  67  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step process to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [35, 62, 56, 27, 19, 49]
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most, followed by item 2.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [93, 14, 46, 17, 38, 64]
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most, followed by item 5.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [10, 52, 16, 3, 67, 80]
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most, followed by item 4.

To maximize fairness and total valuation, we can use a greedy approach, ensuring that each agent gets the item(s) they value highly:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Agent 1 after their highest has been taken).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
