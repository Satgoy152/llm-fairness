Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  49  92  14   7  40
1  89  34  73  48  65  66
2  70  97  14  85  53  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 49 92 14  7 40]
 [89 34 73 48 65 66]
 [70 97 14 85 53 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the total number of items allocated is six.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [50, 49, 92, 14, 7, 40]
   - Highest values are for items 2 (92) and 0 (50).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [89, 34, 73, 48, 65, 66]
   - Highest values are for items 0 (89) and 2 (73).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [70, 97, 14, 85, 53, 12]
   - Highest values are for items 1 (97) and 3 (85).

A potential allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0** has a high value for item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Now, allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 5) by considering the next highest values:
  - For item 3, Agent 2 has a high value (85). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
  - For item 4, Agent 1 has a relatively high value (65). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
  - For item 5, Agent 1 has the highest remaining value (66). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while considering their preferences as much as possible.
