Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  33  17  77  93  44
1  40  12  63  71  27  52
2  55   1  59  50  70  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55  1 59 50 70 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One possible approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly six.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [1, 33, 17, 77, 93, 44]
- Agent 1 values: [40, 12, 63, 71, 27, 52]
- Agent 2 values: [55, 1, 59, 50, 70, 18]

Now, let's allocate items based on maximizing the value for each agent, while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0 (93).
2. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (77).
3. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 1 (52).
4. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (63).
5. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (55).
6. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (33).

By allocating these items, we ensure that:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 5]
- Agent 2 gets item [0]

This allocation also respects that each agent gets at least one item and exactly six items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```
