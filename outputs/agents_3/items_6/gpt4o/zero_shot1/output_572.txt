Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38   4  20  63  48  60
1  87  27  89  62  70  53
2   9  44  67  10  30  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocations does not exceed the number of items. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 63, followed by item 5 at 60.

2. **Agent 1**: For Agent 1, the highest valuations are items 2 at 89 and item 0 at 87.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 67 and item 5 at 51. However, item 2 is already highly valued by Agent 1, so we aim to balance the distribution.

After analyzing the values, a possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0** receives items [3, 5].
- **Agent 1** receives items [0, 2].
- **Agent 2** receives items [1, 4].

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
