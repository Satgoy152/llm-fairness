Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  67   5   0  67  66
1  74  90  71  75  29  99
2  88  38  27  35  38  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 90 71 75 29 99]
 [88 38 27 35 38 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the steps:

- For Agent 0, the highest value is for item 0 (value 79).
- For Agent 1, the highest value is for item 5 (value 99).
- For Agent 2, the highest value is for item 0 (value 88), but since item 0 is already taken, we assign item 3 (value 35).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to maximize total value:

- Agent 0 has item 0, let's assign item 1 (value 67) which is the next highest available.
- Agent 1 has item 5, let's assign item 2 (value 71) which is the next highest available.
- Agent 2 has item 3, let's assign item 4 (value 38) which is the next highest available.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, while attempting to maximize the value for each agent.
