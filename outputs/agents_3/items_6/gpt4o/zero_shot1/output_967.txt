Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  82  13  45  63  43
1  61  41  20  60   0   6
2  41  46  92  93   4  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 82.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 61.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 93.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining 3 items (2, 4, 5) while considering the valuations and ensuring a fair distribution:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Second highest remaining item for Agent 0 is item 4 with a value of 63.

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Second highest remaining item for Agent 1 is item 3, but it’s already taken. The next available is item 2 with a value of 20.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Second highest remaining item for Agent 2 is item 2, but it’s already taken. The next available is item 5 with a value of 26.

Finally, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items [1, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 2]
- Agent 2 gets items [3, 5]

Here’s the JSON output for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
