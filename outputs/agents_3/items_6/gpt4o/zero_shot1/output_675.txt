Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  49  66  18  71  31
1   9  83  84  84  30  69
2  42  97  95  16  22  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will consider each agent's valuations in a way that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to give each agent two items, as there are six items and three agents.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [31, 49, 66, 18, 71, 31]
- Agent 1: [9, 83, 84, 84, 30, 69]
- Agent 2: [42, 97, 95, 16, 22, 45]

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets two items, and the allocation is fair with respect to their valuations. Here's one way to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for item 4 and item 2. Thus, we assign items 4 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   Agent 1 has high valuations for item 1 and item 3. Thus, we assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   Agent 2 has high valuations for item 0 and item 5. Thus, we assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent two items and considers their valuations to maximize satisfaction:

- Agent 0 gets items [4, 2]
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 5]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
