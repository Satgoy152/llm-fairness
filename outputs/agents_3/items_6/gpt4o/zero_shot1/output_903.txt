Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  38  10  14   4  55
1  34  27  50  74   0  65
2  68  11  41  40  30  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 38 10 14  4 55]
 [34 27 50 74  0 65]
 [68 11 41 40 30 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction.

One possible allocation is:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value = 55)
2. Assign items 3 and 2 to agent 1 (values = 74 and 50)
3. Assign items 0, 1, and 4 to agent 2 (values = 68, 11, and 30)

This allocation tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
