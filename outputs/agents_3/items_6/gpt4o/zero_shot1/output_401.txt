Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  91  51  84  17   8
1  63  15  12  42  31  97
2  36  38  87  83  71  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This is a type of "fair division" problem, which can be approached by considering the valuations each agent has for the items and finding a feasible distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest preference for item 1 (91) and item 3 (84).
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (97) and item 0 (63).
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for item 2 (87) and item 4 (71).

Given these observations, we can attempt the following allocation:

1. Assign item 1 and item 3 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
2. Assign item 0 and item 5 to Agent 1, as they have high valuations for these items.
3. Assign item 2 and item 4 to Agent 2, as these items have their highest valuations.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, maximizing their satisfaction based on their highest valued items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' preferences.
