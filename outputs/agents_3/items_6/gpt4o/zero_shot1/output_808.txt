Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  22  81  36  40  83
1   8  88   5  72   8  92
2  53  46  44  78  47  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 88  5 72  8 92]
 [53 46 44 78 47 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuation for the items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [58, 22, 81, 36, 40, 83]
- Agent 1: [8, 88, 5, 72, 8, 92]
- Agent 2: [53, 46, 44, 78, 47, 17]

We can prioritize by looking at which agent values each item the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (58).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (88).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (81).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (78).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (47).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (92).

Based on the above analysis, let's distribute the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and favors the highest valuations.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
