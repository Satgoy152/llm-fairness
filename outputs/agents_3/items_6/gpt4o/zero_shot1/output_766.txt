Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  75  25  94  68  73
1  87  39  76  55  25  88
2  26  31  51  44  97  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations:

Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and may take one more item with a relatively lower value.

Using this information, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations and all items are distributed.
