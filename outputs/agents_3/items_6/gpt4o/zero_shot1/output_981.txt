Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  41  90   5  87  29
1  28  63  79  95  26  79
2  18  93  83  14  99  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 63 79 95 26 79]
 [18 93 83 14 99 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring that every agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 2 and item 4. We will assign these to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 3. We will assign this item to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 1 and item 5. We will assign these to them.
4. **Remaining Item (0)**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most compared to the other agents. We will assign this item to them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while all items are distributed.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
