Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  99  92  73  32   4
1  38  34  65  76  29  37
2  40  36  80  93  66  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents while maximizing their total valuations, we can use a method that considers each agent's preferences. One way to achieve this is by assigning items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (99), 2 (92)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (76)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (93), 2 (80), 4 (66)

To ensure fairness, we will consider each agent's top choices and allocate based on mutual exclusivity or compromise:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated item 1 (99)
- **Agent 1**: Allocated item 3 (76)
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 2 (80)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 4, 5.

Continuing with this approach:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated item 0 (15)
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 4 (66)
- **Agent 1**: Allocated item 5 (37)

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and tries to maximize their total valuations based on preferences.
