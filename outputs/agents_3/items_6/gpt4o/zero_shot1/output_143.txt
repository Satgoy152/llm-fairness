Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  89  32  27  40  95
1  63  98  82  40  18  72
2  66  23  43  67  45  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 89 32 27 40 95]
 [63 98 82 40 18 72]
 [66 23 43 67 45 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuation: [98, 89, 32, 27, 40, 95]
   - Highest value items: 0 (98), 5 (95)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuation: [63, 98, 82, 40, 18, 72]
   - Highest value items: 1 (98), 2 (82)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuation: [66, 23, 43, 67, 45, 80]
   - Highest value items: 5 (80), 3 (67)

Let's proceed with an allocation that balances the overall valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 98).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 98).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 80).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 82) to maximize agent 1's valuation.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 67) to ensure agent 2 gets a fair value.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 40), as agent 0 has already received a high-value item and can take a lower-valued item here.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
