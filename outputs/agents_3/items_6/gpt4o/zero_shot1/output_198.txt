Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  23  40  82  80  29
1  69  91  88  29  37  90
2  86  40  78  80  67  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observation:** Since there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure fairness in the number of items each agent receives.

2. **Sort Items by Valuation:** For each agent, sort the items based on their valuation in descending order.

3. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.
   - Continue assigning the next highest valued item to each agent, maintaining the constraint that each item is only assigned once.

4. **Adjustments for Fairness:** If any agent receives more than 2 items, redistribute to ensure each agent has 2 items.

Using this approach, here is the allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 3 and 4 (82 and 80).
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 1 and 5 (91 and 90).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 0 and 2 (86 and 78).

Given these allocations, each agent receives two items, and the total number of items allocated remains 6.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
