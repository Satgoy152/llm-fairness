Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  77  87  94  30  84
1  90  79  63  63  75  29
2   2  28  19  66   3  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 79 63 63 75 29]
 [ 2 28 19 66  3 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their respective valuations. We can use a simple greedy approach for this allocation. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are [42, 77, 87, 94, 30, 84]. The highest value is for item 3 (94), followed by item 2 (87), and item 5 (84).

2. **Agent 1**: Values are [90, 79, 63, 63, 75, 29]. The highest value is for item 0 (90), followed by item 1 (79), and item 4 (75).

3. **Agent 2**: Values are [2, 28, 19, 66, 3, 17]. The highest value is for item 3 (66), but since item 3 is already taken, we need to look at other items.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest available values:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (94), Item 2 (87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (90), Item 1 (79)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (17), Item 4 (3)

This allocation ensures each agent gets the maximum possible value from the items that have not been allocated to others.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
