Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36   3  87  16  74  13
1  17  61  42  58  75  81
2  22  61  74  88  84   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 61 42 58 75 81]
 [22 61 74 88 84  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, as there are 6 items and 3 agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly at 87.
   - Item 0 is the second highest for Agent 0 at 36.
   - Allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 81, which is the highest for Agent 1.
   - Item 4 is the second highest for Agent 1 at 75.
   - Allocate items 5 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly at 88.
   - Item 1 is the second highest for Agent 2 at 61.
   - Allocate items 3 and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and maximizes their individual valuations for these items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
