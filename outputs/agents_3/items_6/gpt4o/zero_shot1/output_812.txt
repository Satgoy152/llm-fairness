Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  17  46  68  41  66
1  64  11  22  64  71  88
2  33  15  16  92  41  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 17 46 68 41 66]
 [64 11 22 64 71 88]
 [33 15 16 92 41 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We will attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (68).
   - Next highest is item 5 (66).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 5 (88).
   - Next highest is item 4 (71).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (92).
   - Next highest is item 0 (33).

Based on the above, let's allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 will get item 3 (68).
- Agent 1 will get item 5 (88).
- Agent 2 will get item 4 (41).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 2:
- Agent 0 can take item 2 (46).
- Agent 1 can take item 0 (64).
- Agent 2 can take item 1 (15).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 6.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
