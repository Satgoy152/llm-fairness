Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  46  61  78  79  20
1   8  37  51  78  47  25
2  53   4   7  26  53  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a number of items that reflects their preferences as much as possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Items 4 (79), 3 (78), 0 (62), 2 (61).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Items 3 (78), 2 (51), 4 (47), 1 (37).

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (70), 0 (53), 4 (53).

Given this, let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Assign high-value items: 4 (79), 3 (78), 0 (62).

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Assign high-value items: 2 (51), 1 (37).

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Assign high-value item: 5 (70).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, while keeping the number of items distributed evenly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5]
}
```
