Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  48  22  91  80  98
1  27  22  54  59  59   6
2  65  27  79  27  72  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuation:**
   - Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - If an agent has too many items compared to others, consider swapping items to balance the allocation while trying to maintain high valuations.

Let's look at the valuations and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 at 27, Agent 2 at 65. 
  - Tie between Agent 0 and Agent 2, but initially assign to Agent 0 for balance.
  
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 at 22, Agent 2 at 27.
  - Assign to Agent 0.

- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 54, Agent 2 at 79.
  - Assign to Agent 2.

- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 59, Agent 2 at 27.
  - Assign to Agent 0.

- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 59, Agent 2 at 72.
  - Assign to Agent 0, but consider reallocating for balance.

- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 6, Agent 2 at 42.
  - Assign to Agent 0, but consider reallocating for balance.

At this point, Agent 0 has 5 items, while Agents 1 and 2 have fewer. To balance, reassign some items:

- Reassign Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.
- Reassign Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 2.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
