Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  97   8  44  72  65
1  77  21  50   4  14  26
2   2  62  40  95  56  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by matching high valuation items with the respective agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which agent has the highest valuation for each item and try to allocate that item to them.

2. **Balance Allocations**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and try to distribute the items as evenly as possible.

Let's start with the highest valuations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 0 (85).
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 0 (97).
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 1 (50).
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 2 (95).
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 0 (72).
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 0 (65).

Next, we distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 4, 5 (they have the highest values for these items).
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (highest value for this item).
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (highest value for this item).

This allocation respects the valuations and ensures each agent receives at least one item. 

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3]
}
```
