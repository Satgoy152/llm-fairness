Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  89  90  47  58  60
1  36   4  86  73  31  14
2  60  70  15  23  10  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [36  4 86 73 31 14]
 [60 70 15 23 10 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items 1 and 2 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly, but since item 2 is already considered for agent 0, we'll look for other items.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly, but this is already considered for agent 0, so we'll consider other items.

After considering their preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 5.

This allocation ensures that:
- All items are allocated (6 items in total).
- Each agent receives a portion of the total value considering their preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
