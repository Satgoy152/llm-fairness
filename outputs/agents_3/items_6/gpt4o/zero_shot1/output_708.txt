Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  20  70  88  51  58
1  85  50  46  53  11  58
2   7  87  42   6  87   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 87 42  6 87  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the three agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item given that there are 6 items and 3 agents. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have 3 agents and 6 items. Each agent can have up to 2 items to ensure a fair distribution.

2. **Valuation Overview**: 
   - Agent 0 values: [60, 20, 70, 88, 51, 58]
   - Agent 1 values: [85, 50, 46, 53, 11, 58]
   - Agent 2 values: [7, 87, 42, 6, 87, 0]

3. **Assign the Highest Valued Items**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (88).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (85).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 1 and 4 (87).

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - After assigning the highest valued items, we have:
     - Agent 0: item 3
     - Agent 1: item 0
     - Agent 2: items 1 and 4
   - Remaining items are: 2 and 5.

5. **Assign Remaining Items**:
   - For item 2:
     - Agent 0 has a valuation of 70.
     - Agent 1 has a valuation of 46.
     - Agent 2 has a valuation of 42.
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it values it the most.
   - For item 5:
     - Agent 0 has a valuation of 58.
     - Agent 1 has a valuation of 58.
     - Agent 2 has a valuation of 0.
     - To balance allocations, assign item 5 to Agent 1.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: items 3 and 2
   - Agent 1: items 0 and 5
   - Agent 2: items 1 and 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
