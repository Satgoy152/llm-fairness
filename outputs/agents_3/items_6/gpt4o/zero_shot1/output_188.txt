Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99   0  91   3  38  94
1  14  31  24  92  26  52
2  24  33  52  25  95   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 31 24 92 26 52]
 [24 33 52 25 95  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations, while also making sure each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a high valuation for it (99).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it's the highest interest for Agent 1 among the available items.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 has a high valuation for it (91).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (92).
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (95).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it (94).

After this allocation, all items have been distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
