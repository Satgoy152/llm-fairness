Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3   9  46  38  76  59
1   0   1   2  74  65  52
2  22  81  25  46  44  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent, considering each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, to distribute fairly, we need to balance the allocation.
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 3, which is 74. This is significantly higher than their valuation for other items.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 1 and 5.

Let's allocate the items in a manner that balances the total valuation:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value for this item.
2. Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 2 as it has high values for these items.
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for it among the remaining unallocated items.
4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 for a reasonable valuation.
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 for a decent value, balancing the distribution.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations for each agent and satisfy the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items allocated.
