Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  49  92  88  50  46
1   9  50  75  73  11  31
2  76  87  27  73  72  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. There are many possible fair allocations, but one approach is to try to give each agent items that they value highly relative to others.

Let's look at a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (92), which is also the highest among all agents for this item.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (50) and item 3 (73) fairly high.
   - Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 (76) and item 4 (72) highly.
   - Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.

This leaves us with item 5. We need to assign it to one of the agents:

- Item 5 is valued at 46 by Agent 0, 31 by Agent 1, and 72 by Agent 2. 
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.

Now, checking the allocation:
- Agent 0 has items [2]
- Agent 1 has items [1, 3]
- Agent 2 has items [0, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
