Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  27   6  13  40  20
1  33  58  76  62  16  37
2  51  78  41  86  70  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this scenario, we have 3 agents and 6 items to allocate.

Let's examine the valuations and determine an optimal allocation:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 44
- Item 1: 27
- Item 2: 6
- Item 3: 13
- Item 4: 40
- Item 5: 20

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 33
- Item 1: 58
- Item 2: 76
- Item 3: 62
- Item 4: 16
- Item 5: 37

Agent 2 values:
- Item 0: 51
- Item 1: 78
- Item 2: 41
- Item 3: 86
- Item 4: 70
- Item 5: 99

A potential approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (51).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 2 (78).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (76).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 2 (86).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (70).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (99).

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for most items, but to ensure fairness, let's adjust the allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 1 item (Item 4).
- Agent 1: 2 items (Items 2 and 5).
- Agent 2: 3 items (Items 0, 1, and 3).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
