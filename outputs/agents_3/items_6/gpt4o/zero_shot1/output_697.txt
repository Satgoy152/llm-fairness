Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  97   5  86  57  61
1  53  26  98  99  82  53
2  58  49  11  49  86  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [58 49 11 49 86 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while making sure each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (97).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (99).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (86).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 2 (98).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 5 (61).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 0 (58).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the agents receive items they value relatively highly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
