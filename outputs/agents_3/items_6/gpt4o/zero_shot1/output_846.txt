Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  63   8  85  49  28
1  72  61  49  50  39  77
2  15  39  67  33  18   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 63  8 85 49 28]
 [72 61 49 50 39 77]
 [15 39 67 33 18  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we will consider the valuations each agent places on the items and attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [27, 63, 8, 85, 49, 28]
Agent 1: [72, 61, 49, 50, 39, 77]
Agent 2: [15, 39, 67, 33, 18, 5]
```

We will aim to distribute the items to maximize the value each agent receives:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 85), as it is the highest valued single item for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 72), as it is the highest valued single item for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 67), as it is the highest valued single item for Agent 2.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 77), as it is the next highest value item for Agent 1.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 39), as it is the next highest value item for Agent 2 and has higher value than Agent 0's value for item 1.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 49), as it is the next highest value item for Agent 0 among remaining items.

Thus, each agent is allocated 2 items, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
