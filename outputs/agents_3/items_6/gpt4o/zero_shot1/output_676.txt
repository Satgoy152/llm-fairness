Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  14  68  73  66  90
1  69  37  58  58  49  53
2  33  17  54  74  94  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 17 54 74 94 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the given valuations and try to find an allocation that is as fair as possible.

### Valuations
- Agent 0: [87, 14, 68, 73, 66, 90]
- Agent 1: [69, 37, 58, 58, 49, 53]
- Agent 2: [33, 17, 54, 74, 94, 77]

### Allocation Strategy
To achieve fairness, we'll consider both maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensuring a roughly equal number of items for each agent. Since we have 3 agents and 6 items, ideally each agent should get 2 items.

### Initial Allocation Attempt
1. **Agent 0**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 0.
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 5: 90

2. **Agent 1**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 1.
   - Item 2: 58
   - Item 3: 58

3. **Agent 2**: Choose items with the highest values for Agent 2.
   - Item 4: 94
   - Item 1: 17

### Fair Allocation
This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items and attempts to maximize their total value:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent the following total values:
- Agent 0: 87 + 90 = 177
- Agent 1: 58 + 58 = 116
- Agent 2: 94 + 17 = 111

This allocation aims to balance fairness by ensuring each agent receives approximately equal value in proportion to their preferences.
