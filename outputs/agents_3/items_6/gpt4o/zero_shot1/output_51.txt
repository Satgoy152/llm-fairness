Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  50  86  99  94  31
1  72  31   9  77  97  22
2  58   4  87  91  73  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider different methods, such as maximizing total value or giving each agent a fair share based on their valuations. Here, I'll aim for a balanced allocation, considering both fairness and the values of the items to each agent.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 2, 3, and 0.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 72 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 50 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 87 for Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 99 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 97 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 56 for Agent 2).

This allocation attempts to give a fair share to each agent while also considering their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
