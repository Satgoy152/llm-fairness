Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  28  99  60  73  69
1   0  33   4  70  68  80
2   9   5  75  61  91  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 33  4 70 68 80]
 [ 9  5 75 61 91 78]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value that each agent receives. A common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but we must ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible and only six items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the table and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring fairness:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (69).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (28).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (70).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (80).

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the overall value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4]
}
```
