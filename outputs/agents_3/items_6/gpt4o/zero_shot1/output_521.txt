Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  78  64  99  92  34
1  68  99   4  58  97  54
2  37  95  14  34  97  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of the items. Let's start by evaluating which items each agent values the most and then distribute them accordingly.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values for items: [89, 78, 64, 99, 92, 34]
   - Highest values: Item 3 (99), Item 4 (92)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values for items: [68, 99, 4, 58, 97, 54]
   - Highest values: Item 1 (99), Item 4 (97)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values for items: [37, 95, 14, 34, 97, 10]
   - Highest values: Item 1 (95), Item 4 (97)

Given these valuations, we can allocate items as follows, trying to ensure each agent gets items they value highly:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0, as it is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 0 to agent 0, as it is their second-highest remaining valuation.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it is their second-highest remaining valuation.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 has fewer items and values it more than others.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2, as it is the only remaining item and agent 2 has no items yet.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the items among the agents while considering their valuations.
