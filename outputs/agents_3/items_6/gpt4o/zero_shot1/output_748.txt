Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  37  52  50  57  47
1  65  60  28  61  39  45
2  60  49  16  15  50  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each one receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
3. Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 5.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
