Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  19  22  50  11   2
1  10  67  84  25  69  58
2  21   0  67  28  96  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 67 84 25 69 58]
 [21  0 67 28 96 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all agents receive a fair share of items, given there are 6 items and 3 agents. Here’s one way to do this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and consider how to balance the allocations.

2. Assign items one by one, aiming to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while balancing the distribution of items.

Let’s analyze the given values:

- Agent 0 values: [73, 19, 22, 50, 11, 2]
- Agent 1 values: [10, 67, 84, 25, 69, 58]
- Agent 2 values: [21, 0, 67, 28, 96, 95]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest single value for item 2 (value 84). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (value 96) and item 5 (value 95). Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 0 (value 73). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1 (value 67). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** has a reasonable valuation for item 3 (value 50). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and considers high-value preferences.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation is balanced based on the valuations, ensuring each agent receives two items and maximizing their satisfaction based on the given values.
