Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  65  19  10  96  81
1  41   2  19   2  68  60
2  27  36  35  57  99  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 36 35 57 99 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is six.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 65, 19, 10, 96, 81]
- Agent 1: [41, 2, 19, 2, 68, 60]
- Agent 2: [27, 36, 35, 57, 99, 80]

We'll start by assigning each agent their highest valued item, which should ensure a fair distribution of value, and then allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 96)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 41)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 is already taken, so assign Item 2 (value 35)

2. Allocate remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent and ensuring no item is assigned more than once:
   - Agent 0: Remaining highest items are 1 (65) and 5 (81). Assign Item 5.
   - Agent 1: Remaining highest item is 5 (60), but it's assigned. Next is Item 4 (68). Assign Item 4.
   - Agent 2: Remaining highest item is 5 (80), but it's assigned. Next is Item 3 (57). Assign Item 3.

3. Check the number of items allocated:
   - Total items allocated: 6 (Item 0, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Finally, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has received a fair number of items with consideration given to their individual valuations.
