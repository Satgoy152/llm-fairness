Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  38  64  15  64  91
1  59  28  97  81  58   5
2  18  95  57  55  66  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 28 97 81 58  5]
 [18 95 57 55 66 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a simple algorithm that attempts to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We'll aim for a balanced allocation based on the given valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 5 (91), Item 2 (64), Item 4 (64).
   - Allocate Items 5 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 2 (97), Item 3 (81).
   - Allocate Items 3 and 1 to Agent 1. (Item 2 was already allocated to Agent 0).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 1 (95), Item 4 (66).
   - Allocate Items 0 and 4 to Agent 2. (Item 1 was already allocated to Agent 1).

Now, each agent has received an allocation and all items have been distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
