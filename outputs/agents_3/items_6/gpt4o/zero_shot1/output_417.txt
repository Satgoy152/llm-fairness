Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  59  90  85  34  40
1  78  24  74  53  22  18
2  30  71   4  84  34  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 24 74 53 22 18]
 [30 71  4 84 34 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring every agent gets at least one item, given there are three agents and six items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 85
  - Item 4: 34
  - Item 5: 40

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 53
  - Item 4: 22
  - Item 5: 18

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 84
  - Item 4: 34
  - Item 5: 48

We can allocate the items by considering which agent values each item the most:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 78.
2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 71.
3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it and agent 2 both at 34, but agent 0 already has 2 items. To balance, give it to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 48.

With this allocation, each agent gets two items:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 4, and 5.

Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
