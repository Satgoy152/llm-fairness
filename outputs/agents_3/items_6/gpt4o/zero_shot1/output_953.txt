Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  67  40  43  43  35
1  62  39  10  40  66  11
2   2   0  34  83   8  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 39 10 40 66 11]
 [ 2  0 34 83  8 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method called the "maximum sum allocation," which tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here are the valuations of each agent for every item:
- Agent 0: [31, 67, 40, 43, 43, 35]
- Agent 1: [62, 39, 10, 40, 66, 11]
- Agent 2: [2, 0, 34, 83, 8, 18]

To maximize fairness, we should try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 1 has the highest valuation by Agent 0 (67), thus allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 0 has the highest valuation by Agent 1 (62), thus allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 3 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (83), thus allocate to Agent 2.
4. Item 4 has the highest valuation by Agent 1 (66), thus allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 2 has the highest valuation by Agent 0 (40), thus allocate to Agent 0.
6. Lastly, item 5 has remaining, so we look for the best remaining option. Agent 0 values it at 35, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item among the agents.

Using this method, the allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
