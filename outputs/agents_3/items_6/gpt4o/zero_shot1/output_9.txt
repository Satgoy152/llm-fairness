Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  71   5   0  39  64
1  33  15  30  37  99  75
2  24  84  86  36  42  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a satisfactory allocation based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 1 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 2 and 1.

A possible fair allocation could be:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, and 3

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are distributed.
