Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  17  38  72  51  27
1  59  82  41  56  66  41
2  69  11  23  32  58  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 82 41 56 66 41]
 [69 11 23 32 58 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item since there are exactly 3 agents and 6 items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: item 3 (72), item 0 (55)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: item 1 (82), item 4 (66)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: item 5 (52), item 2 (23)

Based on these observations, one possible allocation that ensures each agent gets a fair share of the total value is:

- Assign item 3 and item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 and item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 and item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation should provide each agent with a reasonable total value while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
