Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  50  48  69  34   2
1  51  25  29   9  92  29
2  95  54  40  78   4  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 25 29  9 92 29]
 [95 54 40 78  4 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's consider the values each agent assigns to each item to determine a fair distribution.

### Valuations Table

- Agent 0: [79, 50, 48, 69, 34, 2]
- Agent 1: [51, 25, 29, 9, 92, 29]
- Agent 2: [95, 54, 40, 78, 4, 75]

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High Valuation Items**: Allocate items based on high valuations to maximize satisfaction.
2. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Each item must be assigned to exactly one agent.

### Allocation Process

- **Agent 0**: The highest valuation item for Agent 0 is item 0 (79) and item 3 (69). Consider giving these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: The highest valuation item for Agent 1 is item 4 (92). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: The highest valuation item for Agent 2 is item 2 (40) and item 5 (75). Assign these to Agent 2.

### Remaining Items

- **Items Allocated**: 0, 3, 4, 2, and 5.
- **Unallocated Item**: 1.

- Consider Agent 2 for item 1, since they have a relatively high value (54) for it.

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, 5

### JSON Representation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, and all items are allocated.
