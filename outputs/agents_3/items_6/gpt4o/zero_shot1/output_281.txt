Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  65  48  20  26  17
1  58  49  93  99  57  95
2  95  32   6  98  82  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 49 93 99 57 95]
 [95 32  6 98 82 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has valuations: [63, 65, 48, 20, 26, 17]
2. **Agent 1** has valuations: [58, 49, 93, 99, 57, 95]
3. **Agent 2** has valuations: [95, 32, 6, 98, 82, 85]

We need to allocate the 6 items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

- **Item 3** (highest valuation by Agent 1 with value 99) can be allocated to Agent 1.
- **Item 0** (highest valuation by Agent 2 with value 95) can be allocated to Agent 2.
- **Item 5** (high valuation by Agent 1 with value 95) can be allocated to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** (high valuation by Agent 0 with value 65) can be allocated to Agent 0.
- **Item 4** (high valuation by Agent 2 with value 82) can be allocated to Agent 2.
- **Item 2** (moderate valuation by Agent 1 with value 93) can be allocated to Agent 1.

This allocation considers the highest valuations and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
