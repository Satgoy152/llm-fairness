Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  49  78  12  83  90
1  68  62  55  42  37  64
2  44  80  68   6  90   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (90), 4 (83), 2 (78)
   - Allocate items: 0, 4

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (68), 1 (62), 5 (64)
   - Allocate items: 1, 3

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (90), 1 (80), 2 (68)
   - Allocate items: 2, 5

Let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 4]
- **Agent 1** gets items [1, 3]
- **Agent 2** gets items [2, 5]

Now, let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are distributed among the agents based on their highest values and each agent receives an integer number of items.
