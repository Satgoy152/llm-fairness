Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  47  44  57  20  54
1  38   5  50  19  91  14
2  77  20  78  69  42   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 20 78 69 42  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by looking at the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate those items to them.
2. Continue allocating the remaining items based on the next highest valuations that haven't been assigned yet.

Let's go step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Highest Valuation
- Agent 0: Highest value is item 0 with a value of 68.
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 4 with a value of 91.
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 2 with a value of 78.

Assign these items first.

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
After the first step, items 0, 2, and 4 are allocated. The remaining items are 1, 3, and 5.

- Agent 0 has a high value for item 3 with a value of 57.
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 0 with a value of 38 (already allocated, so next is item 2, which is also allocated, then item 5 with a value of 14).
- Agent 2 has a high value for item 3 with a value of 69 (already allocated to Agent 0, so next is item 0, which is already allocated, then item 1 with a value of 20).

Allocate items as follows:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation
This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation based on the initial high-value preferences.
