Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51   7   3  49  79   1
1  97  58  37   8  36  91
2  70   2  46  86  81  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 58 37  8 36 91]
 [70  2 46 86 81 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents.**
2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.**
3. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items (in this case, since there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should receive 2 items).**

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 58.
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the most at 46.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it the most at 91.

Initial assignment based on highest valuation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

Since Agent 1 has 3 items and Agent 0 has only 1, we need to reallocate to ensure fairness.

- Reallocate Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has no other items and Agent 1 has multiple high-value items).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
