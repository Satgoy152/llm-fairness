Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  37  97  15  15   7
1  81  62  30  22  44  82
2  47   9  13  30  14  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 62 30 22 44 82]
 [47  9 13 30 14 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a relatively balanced total valuation of their assigned items. We'll take into consideration the preferences of each agent based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value: Item 2 (97)
   - Next best option: Item 0 (38)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value: Item 0 (81)
   - Next best option: Item 5 (82)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value: Item 5 (86)
   - Next best option: Item 3 (30)

By following this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 1 (valuations 97 and 37).
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5 (valuations 81 and 82).
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4 (valuations 30 and 14).

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution is fairly balanced according to their valuations.
