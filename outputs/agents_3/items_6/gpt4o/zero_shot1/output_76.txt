Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  36  45  26  12   4
1  50  49  70  92  89   9
2  56  18  61  22  50  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has relatively lower valuations compared to other agents, so we can allocate items that are either less valuable or not critical to maximizing the total value.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 7).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for several items, so we prioritize allocating high-value items to this agent.
   - Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1 (values: 49, 92, 89).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - After allocating key items to Agent 1, allocate the remaining items based on Agent 2's valuations.
   - Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 2 (values: 61, 44).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
