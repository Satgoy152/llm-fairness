Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  18  51  56  89  74
1   5   7  50  67  91  97
2  66  75  86  70  99  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: 75 + 18 + 51 + 56 + 89 + 74 = 363
- Agent 1: 5 + 7 + 50 + 67 + 91 + 97 = 317
- Agent 2: 66 + 75 + 86 + 70 + 99 + 68 = 464

Now, let's allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent places on each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 5, and Agent 2 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 7, and Agent 2 values it at 75. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 50, and Agent 2 values it at 86. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 67, and Agent 2 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 91, and Agent 2 values it at 99. Allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 97, and Agent 2 values it at 68. Allocate to Agent 1.

Let's ensure each agent has at least one item. In this allocation, Agent 0 has only one item, Agent 1 has one, and Agent 2 has four items. This allocation is reasonable given the values.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
