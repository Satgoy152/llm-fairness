Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  51  83  80  80  13
1  46  45  41  52   3  28
2  49  11  72  82  32  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 11 72 82 32 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use an algorithm that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

Given the valuations:
```
Agent 0: [2, 51, 83, 80, 80, 13]
Agent 1: [46, 45, 41, 52, 3, 28]
Agent 2: [49, 11, 72, 82, 32, 53]
```

We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 2 values it at 49 (highest).
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51 (highest).
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 83 (highest).
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 2 values it at 82 (highest).
5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 80 (highest).
6. Item 5:
   - Agent 2 values it at 53 (highest).

However, this allocation gives all items to Agent 0 and Agent 2, which is not fair since Agent 1 receives nothing. We need to adjust the allocation to ensure that each agent ideally gets at least one item if possible.

Let's adjust as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least some high-value items according to their personal valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items fairly and ensures each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.
