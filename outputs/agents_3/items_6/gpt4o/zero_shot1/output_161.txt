Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  85  29  44  63   9
1  19  45  47  46   7  78
2  40  87  76  95  37  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 45 47 46  7 78]
 [40 87 76 95 37 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for a distribution where each agent gets at least one item, given there are 3 agents and 6 items. We will consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [30, 85, 29, 44, 63, 9]
- Agent 1: [19, 45, 47, 46, 7, 78]
- Agent 2: [40, 87, 76, 95, 37, 51]

A straightforward approach is to allocate the highest valued item to each agent, then allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (95), so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (85), so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (78), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.

This leaves items 0, 2, and 4 to be assigned.

4. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2 (76), so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 4 (63), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
6. Finally, **Agent 1** gets item 0, which has the highest remaining value (19).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 2]

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
