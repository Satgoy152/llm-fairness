Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  25   6   3  48   1
1  66  82  44  74  79  67
2  18  56  66  72  65  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total value, while ensuring that all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this:

1. List all possible allocations of items to agents along with their valuations.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Ensure all items are assigned to one of the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (50).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (82).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (72).

These allocations maximize the initial high-value item distribution among different agents. Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 1 values item 4 the second highest (79).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the second highest (66).
- Agent 0 values item 5 the second highest (1).

After these allocations, each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the value for each agent.
