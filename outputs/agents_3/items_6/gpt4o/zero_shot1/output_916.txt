Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  99  46  86  42  36
1  90  96  65  43  19  72
2  25   9  52  90  14  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 99 46 86 42 36]
 [90 96 65 43 19 72]
 [25  9 52 90 14 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction by assigning items where they are valued most. We will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while maximizing the total value.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (99) and 3 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (90) and 1 (96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (90) and 2 (52).

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it highly and item 1 is already taken).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 has the highest valuation for it).

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 4, and 5.

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (65), as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (46) and Agent 2 (52).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (42), as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (19) and Agent 2 (14).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (72), as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (36) and Agent 2 (19).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3

These allocations ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total value allocated is maximized according to their preferences.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
