Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  85  88   6  69  68
1  61  50  24  47  58   0
2  29   9  46  96  88   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 50 24 47 58  0]
 [29  9 46 96 88  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. This involves maximizing the total value each agent gets based on their preferences.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0: 94, 85, 88, 6, 69, 68
- Agent 1: 61, 50, 24, 47, 58, 0
- Agent 2: 29, 9, 46, 96, 88, 5

A possible fair allocation could be done by assigning the highest valued items to each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that each item is allocated only once.
2. If there are ties or if an agent already has an item with a higher value, move to the next best available option.

Following the above method, one possible fair allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 2 (valuations: 94, 85, 88)
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 3 (valuations: 58, 47)
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (valuation: 5)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation uses all six items and ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
