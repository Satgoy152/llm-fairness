Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  95  94  63  84  34
1  65  29  99  33  99  75
2  74  56  68  39  50  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of each item, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 63
  - Item 4: 84
  - Item 5: 34

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 33
  - Item 4: 99
  - Item 5: 75

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 4: 50
  - Item 5: 97

Based on these valuations, we can attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

1. Agent 1 values Item 2 and Item 4 the highest at 99. Allocating these items to Agent 1 seems optimal.
2. Agent 2 values Item 5 the highest at 97. Allocating this item to Agent 2 is suitable.
3. Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 95. Allocating this item to Agent 0 is optimal.
4. Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 3:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 63 (highest among agents for this item), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 at 74 (highest among agents for this item), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items aligned with their preferences wherever possible.
