Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  86  48  94  86  85
1  68  45  68  90   8  72
2  23  66  89  50  59   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this. Hereâ€™s one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 1 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 0 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 2 and 4.

A balanced allocation could be:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for that item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for that item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for that item.
- Now we allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 5) to balance the total values each agent receives.

After considering these values, the following allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is fairly balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This distribution considers the highest value preferences while ensuring fairness.
