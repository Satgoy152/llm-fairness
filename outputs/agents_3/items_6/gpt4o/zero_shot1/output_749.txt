Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  14  75  36   5  71
1  72  97  48  82  83  14
2  71  34  54  68  48  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 97 48 82 83 14]
 [71 34 54 68 48 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [17, 14, 75, 36, 5, 71]
- Agent 1: [72, 97, 48, 82, 83, 14]
- Agent 2: [71, 34, 54, 68, 48, 32]

A fair allocation might prioritize giving each agent one of their highest-valued items while trying to balance the overall distribution. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 is assigned item 2, as it is the highest valuation for them.
2. Agent 1 is assigned item 1, as it is the highest valuation for them.
3. Agent 2 is assigned item 0, as it is one of the highest valuations and not yet allocated.

Now, we have three items left (items 3, 4, 5), and we need to distribute them considering the remaining preferences and ensuring all items are assigned:

4. Agent 1 gets item 3, as it is their next highest valuation from the remaining items.
5. Agent 2 gets item 4, as it is their next highest valuation from the remaining items.
6. Agent 0 gets item 5, as it is the next highest available for them.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
