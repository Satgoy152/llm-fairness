Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  83  74  91  66  84
1  52  31  67  65  83  28
2  12  25  56  75  23  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive all items.

   - Agent 0: 50 + 83 + 74 + 91 + 66 + 84 = 448
   - Agent 1: 52 + 31 + 67 + 65 + 83 + 28 = 326
   - Agent 2: 12 + 25 + 56 + 75 + 23 + 23 = 214

2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing individual values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and that the distribution is fair.

3. Start with the item that provides the highest individual value to each agent:

   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most with 91.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most with 83.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 with 75, but since item 3 is already allocated to agent 0, the next highest is item 2 with 56.

4. After the initial allocation of high-value items:

   - Agent 0: 3
   - Agent 1: 4
   - Agent 2: 2

5. Distribute the remaining items to balance the load:

   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 5

6. Consider the next highest value for each remaining item:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (50), Agent 1 (52), Agent 2 (12)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (83), Agent 1 (31), Agent 2 (25)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (84), Agent 1 (28), Agent 2 (23)

7. Allocate remaining items:

   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (52) for balance.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (83) for balance.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (84) for balance.

8. Final allocation:

   - Agent 0: [3, 1, 5]
   - Agent 1: [4, 0]
   - Agent 2: [2]

Now, present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
