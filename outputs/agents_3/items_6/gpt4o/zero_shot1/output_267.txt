Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8   8  38  11  59  31
1   3  34  59  53  18  15
2  57  72  33  73  88  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 72 33 73 88 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items to maximize each agent's valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [8, 8, 38, 11, 59, 31]
   - Choose the highest valued item for Agent 0: Item 4 (value 59).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [3, 34, 59, 53, 18, 15]
   - Choose the highest valued item for Agent 1: Item 2 (value 59).
   - Choose another high valued item for Agent 1: Item 3 (value 53).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [57, 72, 33, 73, 88, 11]
   - Choose the highest valued item for Agent 2: Item 4 is already taken, so choose Item 1 (value 72).
   - Choose another high valued item for Agent 2: Item 0 (value 57).
   - Choose one more item for Agent 2: Item 5 (value 11).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the highest possible value from the available items while allocating all 6 items. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 0, 5]
}
```
