Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  91  31  71  93   1
1  68  27  66  84  13  69
2  51   0  52  64  12  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [51  0 52 64 12 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives a collection of items such that the total value of the items is as balanced as possible. Here is a simple approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Start by allocating the items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than two items (since there are 6 items and 3 agents).

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [29, 91, 31, 71, 93, 1]
- Agent 1: [68, 27, 66, 84, 13, 69]
- Agent 2: [51, 0, 52, 64, 12, 27]

Now, we'll allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 4 (value 93) to agent 0.
2. Allocate item 3 (value 84) to agent 1.
3. Allocate item 0 (value 51) to agent 2.
4. Allocate item 1 (value 91) to agent 0.
5. Allocate item 2 (value 66) to agent 1.
6. Allocate item 5 (value 27) to agent 2.

This way, each agent gets two items, and the distribution is balanced based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
