Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  71  12  54  13  46
1  71  13  89  87  18  78
2  85  29  20  71  38  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [85 29 20 71 38 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items with high personal valuations.
- Agent 1 also gets items that they value highly.
- Agent 2 receives items based on their best available valuations.

Let's consider the valuations to determine a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 1 (71)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 3 (87)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (85), other considerations for remaining items

Based on the highest valuations, one possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0, Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 2, Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 4, Item 5

Thus, the JSON allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assumes that we prioritize each agent's highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed fairly.
