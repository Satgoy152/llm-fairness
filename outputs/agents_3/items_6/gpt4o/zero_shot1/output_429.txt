Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  15  52  18  56  89
1  60  58  28  36  20  50
2  39  51  29  20  48   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 58 28 36 20 50]
 [39 51 29 20 48  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 75.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 51.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 52.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with 36.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 56.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 89.

Now, letâ€™s allocate the items to maximize fairness while considering these preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Item 4 is left to be allocated, and since Agent 0 already has the most items, we consider the remaining agents. Agent 1 values it at 20 and Agent 2 at 48, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations.
