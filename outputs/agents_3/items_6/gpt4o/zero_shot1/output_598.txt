Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  86  89  77  78  27
1  90  25  25   6  52   0
2  16  59  26  78   9  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 25 25  6 52  0]
 [16 59 26 78  9 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible given the total number of items). We will consider each item's highest value to the agents while trying to distribute evenly.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 34     | 86     | 89     | 77     | 78     | 27     |
| 1     | 90     | 25     | 25     | 6      | 52     | 0      |
| 2     | 16     | 59     | 26     | 78     | 9      | 87     |

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 1 (90).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 0 (86).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value for Agent 0 (89).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 2 (78).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value for Agent 0 (78).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value for Agent 2 (87).

After assigning items based on the highest values, let's ensure fair distribution with each agent getting at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5

This allocation ensures that all agents are considered and each item is allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
