Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  70  18  56  89  84
1  24  32  35  60  33  17
2  56  76  61  10  35  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent ends up with approximately the same number of items, considering there are only 6 items and 3 agents.

Let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to balance the allocation based on these valuations.

- Agent 0's total valuation is 334.
- Agent 1's total valuation is 201.
- Agent 2's total valuation is 259.

We will try to allocate items such that the sum of the valuations for items received by each agent is as balanced as possible. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Allocate the highest valued items for each agent based on their individual preferences:

   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 and item 5.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1.

2. Allocate remaining items to balance and maximize each agentâ€™s total valuation:

   - Agent 0: already has items 4 and 5.
   - Agent 1: add item 2 to their allocation.
   - Agent 2: add item 0 and item 3 to their allocation.

This gives us the following allocation:

- Agent 0: items 4, 5
- Agent 1: items 2
- Agent 2: items 0, 1, 3

The total valuations for each agent with this allocation are:

- Agent 0: 89 + 84 = 173
- Agent 1: 35
- Agent 2: 56 + 76 + 10 = 142

This allocation considers both the number of items and attempts to balance the total valuation fairly among the agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
