Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  39  92  17  43  26
1  51  19  44  55  90   4
2  46  19  30   8  18  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 39 92 17 43 26]
 [51 19 44 55 90  4]
 [46 19 30  8 18 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 2 has the highest valuation (92).
   - Item 0 also has a high valuation (81).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 has the highest valuation (90).
   - Item 3 has a moderate valuation (55).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5 has a decent valuation (49).
   - Item 1 has a low valuation (19), but is the only unallocated item left.

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and the total number of items allocated is 6. Each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
