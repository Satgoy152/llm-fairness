Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  37  38  19  80  63
1  16   4  24  62  90   0
2  22  16  53  13  71  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. List each agent's valuations for the items.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet received their fair share.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 16 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 22 (highest)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 16
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 24
   - Agent 2 values it at 53 (highest)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 62 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 80 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 90 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 71
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 0
   - Agent 2 values it at 18
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.
