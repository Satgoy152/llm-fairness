Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  77  35  77   5  70
1  63  31  18  77   5  11
2  46  31  26  82  15  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations and distributing items so that each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share, considering their valuations.

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll try to balance the total value of items each agent receives by considering their valuations:

- Agent 0: High valuation for item 0 (99), 1 (77), and 3 (77).
- Agent 1: High valuation for item 3 (77).
- Agent 2: High valuation for item 3 (82).

Here is one possible allocation that distributes the items fairly based on the given valuations:

- Assign item 0 and item 1 to agent 0, as they highly value these items.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they value it relatively high and it helps balance the allocation.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2, even though it's not highly valued, it's necessary to allocate all items fairly.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 to give them a fair distribution of value.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 to provide them with the remaining item.

Given these considerations, the final allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the items among the agents while respecting their individual valuations as much as possible.
