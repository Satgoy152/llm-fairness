Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  17  89  83   8  87
1  46  29  41  17  40  89
2  62  26  83  87  52  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 17 89 83  8 87]
 [46 29 41 17 40 89]
 [62 26 83 87 52 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent gets an approximately equal number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**'s valuations are: [26, 17, 89, 83, 8, 87]
2. **Agent 1**'s valuations are: [46, 29, 41, 17, 40, 89]
3. **Agent 2**'s valuations are: [62, 26, 83, 87, 52, 90]

Now, we will allocate the items step by step:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 62, the highest, so it goes to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 29, the highest among those not already assigned an item, so it goes to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 89, the highest, so it goes to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 87, the highest, so it goes to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 40, the highest, so it goes to Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 90, the highest, so it goes to Agent 2.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 5

Now, we can present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
