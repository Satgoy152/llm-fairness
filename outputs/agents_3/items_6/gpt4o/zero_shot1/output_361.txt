Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  90  34  98  82  22
1  15  79  49  59  41  89
2  48  15  87  80  62  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 79 49 59 41 89]
 [48 15 87 80 62 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [7, 90, 34, 98, 82, 22]
- Agent 1 values: [15, 79, 49, 59, 41, 89]
- Agent 2 values: [48, 15, 87, 80, 62, 38]

A potential allocation strategy is to maximize the sum of the allocated items' values for each agent:

1. Assign the highest value item from the remaining unallocated items to the agent who values it the most.
2. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Following this strategy:

- Item 3 (value 98 for agent 0) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 0 (value 48 for agent 2) goes to Agent 2.
- Item 1 (value 90 for agent 0) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 2 (value 87 for agent 2) goes to Agent 2.
- Item 5 (value 89 for agent 1) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 4 (value 82 for agent 0) goes to Agent 0.

Here's how the allocation looks:

Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 4
Agent 1: Item 5
Agent 2: Items 0, 2

Let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
