Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  65  69  55  15  60
1  99  64  53  49  45  60
2  26  20  71  29  55  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items. We will use a methodical approach to match agents with items based on their valuations, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's review the table and evaluate potential allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.

Given agents 0 and 1 both value items 0, 1, and 2 highly, and agent 2 values item 5 highly, we can attempt to distribute the items by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring a relatively fair distribution.

A potential allocation could be:
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 97).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 69).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 64).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 49).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 55).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 86).

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5

Each agent receives two items, and this allocation attempts to respect the relative valuations and distribute the items fairly.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
