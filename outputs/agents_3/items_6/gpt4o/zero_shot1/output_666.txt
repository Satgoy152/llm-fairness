Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78   7  74  36  33  58
1   4  31  64  19  11  94
2  62  79  70  82   8  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 79 70 82  8 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. We aim for an allocation that balances the distribution based on the given valuations. Let's go through the valuations step by step to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.

Using these observations, we can try the following allocation strategy:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the high-value items according to their preferences, and all items are distributed.

The final allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
