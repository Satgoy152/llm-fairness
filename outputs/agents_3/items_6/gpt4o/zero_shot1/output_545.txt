Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  96  60  21  61   7
1   0  65  96  37  46  59
2   2  52  65  62  23  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 65 96 37 46 59]
 [ 2 52 65 62 23 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A simple approach is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Analyze the matrix to understand the highest valuations for each item.
2. Allocate items to agents according to their highest valuations, ensuring each item is given to only one agent.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure fairness in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (16).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (96).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (62).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (61).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (97).

Now, let's allocate the items keeping a balance in the number of items each agent gets:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1: Total items = 2
- Agent 1 gets item 2: Total items = 1
- Agent 2 gets items 3, 4, and 5: Total items = 3

This allocation respects the valuations and ensures each agent gets at least one item. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
