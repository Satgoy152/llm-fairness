Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54   3  50  54  17  54
1  19  72  78   1  75  26
2  15  74  10  21  30  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54  3 50 54 17 54]
 [19 72 78  1 75 26]
 [15 74 10 21 30 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent gets, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0: [54, 3, 50, 54, 17, 54]
- Agent 1: [19, 72, 78, 1, 75, 26]
- Agent 2: [15, 74, 10, 21, 30, 19]

We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, as there are 6 items and 3 agents. We'll distribute these items in a way that maximizes each agent's value.

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (54), Item 3 (54), Item 5 (54)
   - Assign Item 0 and Item 3 to Agent 0

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (78), Item 4 (75), Item 1 (72)
   - Assign Item 2 and Item 4 to Agent 1

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (74), Item 4 (30), Item 3 (21)
   - Items 1 and 4 are already assigned, so assign Item 5 to Agent 2

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]

The allocations in the required JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
