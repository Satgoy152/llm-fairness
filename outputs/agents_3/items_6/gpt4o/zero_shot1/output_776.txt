Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  97  87   6  97  59
1  50  11  32  53  86  42
2  69  59  53  51  35   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 11 32 53 86 42]
 [69 59 53 51 35  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [7, 97, 87, 6, 97, 59]
   - Highest valued items: 1 (97), 4 (97)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [50, 11, 32, 53, 86, 42]
   - Highest valued items: 4 (86), 3 (53)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [69, 59, 53, 51, 35, 4]
   - Highest valued items: 0 (69), 1 (59)

Considering the above, we aim to assign the highest valued items to each agent while ensuring that each gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 1 (97) and item 2 (87)
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 4 (86) and item 3 (53)
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 0 (69) and item 5 (4)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high values according to their preferences, and all items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
