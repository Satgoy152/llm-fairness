Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  29  32  16  98  80
1  67  71  59  60  47  29
2  35  28  55  18  50  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [6, 29, 32, 16, 98, 80]
   - Agent 1: [67, 71, 59, 60, 47, 29]
   - Agent 2: [35, 28, 55, 18, 50, 34]

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (71).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (55).

3. **Allocate remaining items considering the second-highest valuations and ensuring fairness:**
   - After the initial allocation:
     - Agent 0 has item 4.
     - Agent 1 has item 1.
     - Agent 2 has item 2.

4. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the second most (80).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the second most (60).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the second most (35).

5. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [4, 5].
   - Agent 1 gets items [1, 3].
   - Agent 2 gets items [2, 0].

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated based on the highest possible valuations while maintaining fairness.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
