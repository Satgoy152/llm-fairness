Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80   5  16  93  69  88
1  83  13  66  64  83  11
2  48  74  71  15   8  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 74 71 15  8 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution is as equitable as possible based on their valuations.

Let's use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (93), 5 (88), 0 (80)
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (83), 4 (83), 2 (66)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (74), 2 (71), 5 (59)
   - Allocate items 1, 2, and 5 to agent 2.

Now, let's review the allocations:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 2, and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 6 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
