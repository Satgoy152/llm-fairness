Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  31  86  41  76  93
1  27   2   4  67   9  32
2  28  44  82  32  82  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which agent values each item the most.
2. **Assign Items**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 at 27, Agent 2 at 28. Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 at 2, Agent 2 at 44. Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 4, Agent 2 at 82. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 67, Agent 2 at 32. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 9, Agent 2 at 82. Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 at 32, Agent 2 at 49. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
