Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  36  64  23  16  24
1  36   9  31  94  75  75
2  94  91  96  85  64  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 91 96 85 64 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s one way we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 0, 2, and 1 highly, with valuations of 60, 64, and 36 respectively. Among these, item 2 has the highest valuation, so it should be allocated to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 94; hence, item 3 should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuations for items 0, 1, and 2, but since item 2 is already allocated, item 0, with a valuation of 94, should be allocated to Agent 2.

Continuing in this manner, we can allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the second-highest valuation for item 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as they have the second-highest valuation for item 4.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as they also have a high valuation for this item.

Final allocations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents in a way that reflects their valuations as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent should receive a whole number of items.
