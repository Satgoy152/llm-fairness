Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  21  15  73  59  60
1  16  58  52  54  68  44
2  61  34   6  84  10  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 58 52 54 68 44]
 [61 34  6 84 10 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while considering fairness. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [24, 21, 15, 73, 59, 60]
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (73), followed by item 5 (60).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [16, 58, 52, 54, 68, 44]
   - Highest valuation is for item 4 (68), followed by item 1 (58).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuations: [61, 34, 6, 84, 10, 59]
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (84), followed by item 0 (61).

Let's allocate the items considering the highest valuations and avoiding conflicts:

- **Item 3**: Highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 2. Since Agent 2 values it the highest, allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Only Agent 1 has a high valuation for this, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Second highest for Agent 1, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Second highest for Agent 2, allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Second highest for Agent 0, allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Only item left, allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the highest preferences of each agent and ensures an integer number of items per agent.
