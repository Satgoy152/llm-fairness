Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  72  48  37  52  45
1  31  20  99  49  16  87
2  30  16  24  85  85  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One way to approach this is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum of allocations" method, which tries to maximize the total value of the allocated items for all agents.

Let's attempt to allocate the items considering the valuations:

1. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to ensure fairness.
3. Maximize the total value allocated to each agent while respecting the constraint of 6 total items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 0: They have relatively high valuations for items 1 (72) and 4 (52).
- Agent 1: Their highest valuation is for item 2 (99), followed by item 5 (87).
- Agent 2: Their highest valuations are for items 3 (85) and 5 (87).

Based on this, an allocation that respects the constraints and tries to maximize fairness and values could be:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 2 to agent 1, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0, balancing the allocation since 0 has only one item.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1, as 1 has a high value for it and 2 can still receive value from item 3.

This results in:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2: Item 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute items while maximizing the total value for each agent.
