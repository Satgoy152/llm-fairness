Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  10  85  81   9  10
1  40  39  60  57  99   7
2  96  47  86  86  60  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 39 60 57 99  7]
 [96 47 86 86 60 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations of the items. We will assign the items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Values: [27, 10, 85, 81, 9, 10]

- Agent 1:
  - Values: [40, 39, 60, 57, 99, 7]

- Agent 2:
  - Values: [96, 47, 86, 86, 60, 71]

Let's make the allocations considering a fair distribution:

1. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (96), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (85), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 2 values item 3 the next highest (86), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
5. Agent 2 values item 5 the next highest (71), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 1 values item 1 the next highest (39), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: [2]
- Agent 1 gets items: [4, 1]
- Agent 2 gets items: [0, 3, 5]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
