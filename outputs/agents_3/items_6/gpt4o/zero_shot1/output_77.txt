Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  45  42  23  75  14
1  25  68  26  57  84   3
2  80  39  44  28  30   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [80 39 44 28 30  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are distributed. Let's consider a greedy approach to distribute the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [55, 45, 42, 23, 75, 14]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [25, 68, 26, 57, 84, 3]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** [80, 39, 44, 28, 30, 5]

**Step 1:** Assign the highest valued item for each agent:
- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (75).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (84), but it's already taken. So, their next highest is item 1 (68).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (80).

**Step 2:** Assign remaining items based on the next highest valuations that are not yet assigned:
- Agent 0's next highest is item 0 (55), but it's taken. So, item 1 (45) is already taken by Agent 1, next is item 2 (42).
- Agent 1 has item 4 (84) as their highest, but it's taken. So, next highest remaining is item 3 (57).
- Agent 2 has item 0 (80) as their highest, which they already have. Next is item 2 (44), but it's taken. So, item 4 (30) is available.

**Step 3:** Assign the remaining items to balance allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 3 (23) is available.
- Agent 1: Item 5 (3) is available.
- Agent 2: All their preferred items are taken.

Final allocations are:
- Agent 0: Items [4, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
