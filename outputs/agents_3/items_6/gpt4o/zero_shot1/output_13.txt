Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  55  47  22  82  77
1  68   2  64  15  84  72
2  44  56  75  49  75  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their valuations for the items. We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- For the remaining items, we consider the next highest valuations and distribute them to balance the total value each agent receives.

By following these steps, we can distribute the items as follows:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (82).
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (68).
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (80).

Now, we have items 1, 2, and 3 left to allocate:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2 have high values for Agent 2, but Agent 0 has a decent valuation for item 1 (55), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (64), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (49).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
