Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  37  10  32  65  60
1  94  15  91  25  79   8
2  52  20  66  47  73   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [52 20 66 47 73  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Allocate based on the highest value each agent has for the items, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item (if possible), and the allocation sums up to 6 items in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest values: Item 4 (65), Item 5 (60)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest values: Item 0 (94), Item 2 (91)
  
- Agent 2:
  - Highest values: Item 3 (47), Item 1 (20)

Now let's allocate these items fairly:

- Agent 0: Assign items [4, 5]
- Agent 1: Assign items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Assign items [3, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
