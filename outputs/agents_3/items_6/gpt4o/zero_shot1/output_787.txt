Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  52  43  26  17   7
1  81   2  15  13   8  30
2  74  44   5  47  86  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 52 43 26 17  7]
 [81  2 15 13  8 30]
 [74 44  5 47 86 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we consider maximizing the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [39, 52, 43, 26, 17, 7]
- Agent 1 values: [81, 2, 15, 13, 8, 30]
- Agent 2 values: [74, 44, 5, 47, 86, 19]

We will allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

1. **Agent 1 (highest single valuation):** Item 0, with a valuation of 81.
2. **Agent 2 (highest available single valuation):** Item 4, with a valuation of 86.
3. **Agent 0 (next highest available single valuation):** Item 1, with a valuation of 52.

Having assigned one item to each agent, we now need to allocate the remaining three items:

4. **Agent 0:** Item 2, with a valuation of 43.
5. **Agent 2:** Item 3, with a valuation of 47.
6. **Agent 1:** Item 5, with a valuation of 30.

Now, each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all six items have been distributed.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
