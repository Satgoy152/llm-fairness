Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  36  14  96  70  99
1  61  36  39  30  63  99
2  25  79  43  98  96  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 36 14 96 70 99]
 [61 36 39 30 63 99]
 [25 79 43 98 96 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values: [27, 36, 14, 96, 70, 99]
- Agent 1 values: [61, 36, 39, 30, 63, 99]
- Agent 2 values: [25, 79, 43, 98, 96, 74]

The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, because Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (98).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, because Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (99).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, because Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (96).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, because Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (79).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, because Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (61).
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, because Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (39).

This allocation gives the following:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.

The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
