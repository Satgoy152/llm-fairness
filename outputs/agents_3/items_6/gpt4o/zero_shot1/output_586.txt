Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22   4   3   1   3  82
1  69  48  42  80  27  34
2  17  47  25  98   8  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum of valuations" where each item is given to the agent that values it the most. Let's go through each item, check which agent values it the highest, and assign accordingly:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 22
  - Agent 1 values it at 69 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 17
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 4
  - Agent 1 values it at 48 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 47
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 3
  - Agent 1 values it at 42 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 25
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 1
  - Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values it at 98
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 3
  - Agent 1 values it at 27
  - Agent 2 values it at 8
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 82 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values it at 34
  - Agent 2 values it at 33
  - Assign to Agent 0

Now, we need to ensure a fair distribution where each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's reassign to balance better:

1. From Agent 1, we reassign Item 1 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it second highest and currently has fewer items).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]

Now, representing this in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
