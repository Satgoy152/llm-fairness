Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  45  96  28   4  85
1  88  86   6  97  31   4
2  19  70  57   5  75  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The items with the highest valuations for Agent 0 are items 2 (96), 0 (94), and 5 (85).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The items with the highest valuations for Agent 1 are items 3 (97), 0 (88), and 1 (86).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The items with the highest valuations for Agent 2 are items 5 (83), 4 (75), and 1 (70).

Using a fair distribution approach, we'll start by giving each agent the item with their highest valuation, and then distribute the remaining items to balance the total value received by each agent.

- **Item 3** (highest value for Agent 1) is allocated to Agent 1.
- **Item 2** (highest value for Agent 0) is allocated to Agent 0.
- **Item 5** (highest value for Agent 2) is allocated to Agent 2.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 0** has high value for both Agent 0 and Agent 1. To balance, allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** is valuable to both Agent 1 and Agent 2. To balance, allocate it to Agent 1.
- **Item 4** is valuable to Agent 2, so allocate it to Agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their total valuation while fairly distributing all 6 items.
