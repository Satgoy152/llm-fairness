Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  56  12  49  29  69
1  96  84  87  57   5  90
2  61  71  31  21   8  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation of the items by the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's use the following heuristic approach:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign each agent their highest valued item, if possible, to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

2. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Allocate the remaining items to the agent who values them the most, but try to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Following this approach, here's a step-by-step allocation:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (98).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (87).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (89).

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]

Items remaining: 1, 3, 4

### Step 2: Remaining Allocation
- Item 1: 
  - Agent 1 values it at 84, highest among agents.
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
  
- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 49, highest among agents.
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
  
- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 29, highest among agents.
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 1]
- Agent 2: [5]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their items while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
