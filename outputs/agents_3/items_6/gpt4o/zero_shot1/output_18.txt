Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  60  37  24  98  16
1  78  94  41  47  59  64
2   3   2  86  96   2  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 94 41 47 59 64]
 [ 3  2 86 96  2 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents so that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to maximize the total value assigned while ensuring each agent's allocation is fair based on their preferences.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  60  37  24  98  16
1  78  94  41  47  59  64
2   3   2  86  96   2  58
```

We need to allocate each item to one of the agents. A simple way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 78 (highest), so assign to agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 94 (highest), so assign to agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 86 (highest), so assign to agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 96 (highest), so assign to agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 98 (highest), so assign to agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 64 (highest), but let's balance the allocation:
  - Agent 2 has 2 items, Agent 1 has 2, and Agent 0 has 1, so let's assign it to Agent 0 to balance.

After this consideration, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations for some of them, and the distribution is fair in the sense of the number of items each agent receives.
