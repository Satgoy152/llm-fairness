Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  73  25  84  22  15
1  13  38  56   5  56  69
2  80  91  40   3  80  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 38 56  5 56 69]
 [80 91 40  3 80 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (84), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values Item 5 the highest (69), so we allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest (91), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Next, we consider the remaining items: 0, 2, and 4.

For Item 0:
- Agent 2 values it the highest (80), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

For Item 2:
- Agent 1 values it the highest (56), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

For Item 4:
- Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value it equally (56 and 80, respectively), but Agent 2 has already received two high-value items. Therefore, we allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 for balance.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
