Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  32  32  43  66  35
1  31  42  14  97  73  30
2  88  25  37   0  17  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 42 14 97 73 30]
 [88 25 37  0 17 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations accordingly:

Agent 0 valuations:
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 32
- Item 2: 32
- Item 3: 43
- Item 4: 66
- Item 5: 35

Agent 1 valuations:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 42
- Item 2: 14
- Item 3: 97
- Item 4: 73
- Item 5: 30

Agent 2 valuations:
- Item 0: 88
- Item 1: 25
- Item 2: 37
- Item 3: 0
- Item 4: 17
- Item 5: 10

We can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (88).

2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97).

3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1: Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4 (73), which is the second-highest among all agents for this item.

4. Assign item 5 to Agent 0: Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 5 (35).

5. Assign item 1 to Agent 0: Agent 0 has a comparable valuation for item 1 (32), which is higher than Agent 2's valuation.

6. Assign item 2 to Agent 2: Agent 2 has a valuation of 37 for item 2, which is higher than both other agents.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total valuation is maximized for each agent. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
