Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  90  22   9  52  31
1  18  96  96   2  40  72
2  41  17  12  26  60  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 1 (90), 0 (32), and 4 (52).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 1 (96), 2 (96), and 5 (72).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 4 (60), 0 (41), and 3 (26).

Based on these valuations and to ensure a fair distribution, we could allocate as follows:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (90) instead of Agent 1 (96) to balance the allocation, since Agent 1 has other high-value items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (96) and item 5 to Agent 1 (72).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (60).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (32).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (26).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a roughly fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
