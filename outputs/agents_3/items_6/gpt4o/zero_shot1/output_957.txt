Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  82  18  52  15  51
1  66  43  64  75   5  24
2   8  47  72  97  28  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives items. A balanced and straightforward approach is to assign items based on their highest value to any particular agent, ensuring each agent gets a chance to have items allocated to them.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 0: 78
   - Item 1: 82
   - Item 2: 18
   - Item 3: 52
   - Item 4: 15
   - Item 5: 51

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 0: 66
   - Item 1: 43
   - Item 2: 64
   - Item 3: 75
   - Item 4: 5
   - Item 5: 24

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Item 0: 8
   - Item 1: 47
   - Item 2: 72
   - Item 3: 97
   - Item 4: 28
   - Item 5: 31

Let's allocate based on maximizing the individual agent's value for each item:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (value 82) is highest for Agent 0.
  - Item 0 (value 78) is also high, but since Agent 1 also values it highly, we need to find balance.

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 3 (value 75) is highest for Agent 1.
  - Item 0 (value 66) can also be allocated here if it provides better balance.

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 3 (value 97) is highest for Agent 2, but since Agent 1 values it significantly too, let's focus on other items.
  - Item 2 (value 72) is the next highest value for Agent 2.

Given these considerations, here's a balanced allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4]
  - Item 1 (value 82)
  - Item 4 (value 15)

- **Agent 1**: [3, 0]
  - Item 3 (value 75)
  - Item 0 (value 66)

- **Agent 2**: [2, 5]
  - Item 2 (value 72)
  - Item 5 (value 31)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their valuations, attempting to maximize the total value for each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
