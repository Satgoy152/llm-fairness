Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  20  33  87  18  13
1  89  92  51  80  95   1
2  15  33  17  18  18  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives approximately an equal number of items, given that there are 3 agents and 6 items to distribute.

Let's evaluate the best allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 3 (87)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (92), Item 4 (95)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Moderate valuation: Item 5 (53)

Based on the highest valuations, we can allocate as follows to maximize satisfaction:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items and maximizes their happiness based on the valuations provided.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
