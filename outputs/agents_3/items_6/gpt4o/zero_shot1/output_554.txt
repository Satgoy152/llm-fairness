Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  57  76  62   4  42
1  59   4  29  38  85  99
2  61  43  17  14   3  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59  4 29 38 85 99]
 [61 43 17 14  3 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction or utility. One approach is to use a method like the "greedy allocation," where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the situation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Values: [5, 57, 76, 62, 4, 42]
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Values: [59, 4, 29, 38, 85, 99]
  
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Values: [61, 43, 17, 14, 3, 22]

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (61)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (57)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (76)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (62)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (85)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (99)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, while all items are allocated.
