Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  52  67  91  66  72
1  50  66  53  50  14  89
2  28  43   3   1  78  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 52 67 91 66 72]
 [50 66 53 50 14 89]
 [28 43  3  1 78 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the value each agent places on each item. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's evaluate the best allocation based on the given values:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [61, 52, 67, 91, 66, 72]
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (91), Item 5 (72)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [50, 66, 53, 50, 14, 89]
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (89), Item 1 (66)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [28, 43, 3, 1, 78, 72]
   - Highest value items: Item 4 (78), Item 5 (72)

**Allocation Plan:**

- **Agent 0** could get Item 3 (91) and Item 0 (61) which are high value for them.
- **Agent 1** could get Item 1 (66) and Item 5 (89), which are their highest values.
- **Agent 2** could get Item 4 (78) and Item 2 (3), balancing their preferences and ensuring all items are distributed.

This allocation maximizes the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

**Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
