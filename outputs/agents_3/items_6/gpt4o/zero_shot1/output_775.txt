Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  24  72  63  39  96
1  67  19   8  46  47   2
2  21  91  13  76  57  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 19  8 46 47  2]
 [21 91 13 76 57 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while keeping the distribution fair. Here is one possible allocation that considers the value each agent places on the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest after item 5, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 4 the second highest, so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 3 the second highest, so allocate item 3 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the distribution is balanced in terms of maximizing each agent's total value.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
