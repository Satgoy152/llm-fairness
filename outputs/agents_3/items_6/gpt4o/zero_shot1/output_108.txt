Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  52  52  84  43  32
1  69  74  81  54  66   0
2  57  84  29  86  22  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 52 52 84 43 32]
 [69 74 81 54 66  0]
 [57 84 29 86 22 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning the items based on the valuations provided in the table. 

Let's analyze the table:

```
Agent 0: [59, 52, 52, 84, 43, 32]
Agent 1: [69, 74, 81, 54, 66, 0]
Agent 2: [57, 84, 29, 86, 22, 67]
```

One strategy is to assign items to agents based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Item 3:** Highest value is Agent 2 with 86.
2. **Item 2:** Highest value is Agent 1 with 81.
3. **Item 1:** Highest value is Agent 2 with 84.
4. **Item 0:** Highest value is Agent 1 with 69.
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is Agent 1 with 66.
6. **Item 5:** Highest value is Agent 2 with 67.

Now, let's allocate these items ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

1. Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 2**.
2. Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 1**.
3. Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 2**.
4. Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 1**.
5. Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 1**.
6. Assign **Item 5** to **Agent 0**.

Now, we check the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [5]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [3, 1]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 0, 4],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
