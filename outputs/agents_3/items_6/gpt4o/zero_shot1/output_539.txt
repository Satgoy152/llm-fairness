Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   1  16  97   6   4
1  28  99  16  63  77  57
2  77  51  77   4  66  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. One common approach to achieve fairness is to use the "max-min fairness" principle, which aims to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents.

Let's examine the valuations given:
```
Agent 0: [20, 1, 16, 97, 6, 4]
Agent 1: [28, 99, 16, 63, 77, 57]
Agent 2: [77, 51, 77, 4, 66, 32]
```

A possible allocation considering fairness and maximizing each agent's preference might look like this:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since it has the highest valuation for them and is the highest among all items for any agent.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it has the highest valuation for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since it has the highest valuation for them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 as it has a high valuation for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since it is equally valued by Agent 0 but it balances Agent 2's allocations.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 as it has a reasonable valuation for them.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with consideration given to the agents' preferences as indicated by their valuations.
