Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  33  82  38  46  81
1  24  19  34  33  27  38
2  79  51  87  58  39  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [24 19 34 33 27 38]
 [79 51 87 58 39 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method to balance the total value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied as much as possible according to their valuations.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:** Sum up the values each agent has for each item. This helps in understanding which items have the highest combined value and might be more contentious.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Individual Value:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This will maximize satisfaction.

Let's go through the allocations:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the highest with a valuation of 96.
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it the highest with a valuation of 51.
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the highest with a valuation of 87.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the highest with a valuation of 58.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the highest with a valuation of 46.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the highest with a valuation of 81.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value most, and all items are distributed fairly across the agents.
