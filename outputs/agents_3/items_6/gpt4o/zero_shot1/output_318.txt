Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  84  77  90  62  12
1  45  72   7  69  89  52
2  64  91  37  45  86   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 72  7 69 89 52]
 [64 91 37 45 86  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet.
- Make sure each agent gets at least one item.
- Ensure that all six items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for item 3 (90), item 1 (84), and item 2 (77).
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for item 4 (89), item 1 (72), and item 3 (69).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for item 1 (91), item 4 (86), and item 0 (64).

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 since they value it the most (90).
2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 since they value it the most (89).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 since they value it the most (91).

Now, allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 5) while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (64).
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (77).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (52).

Now, each agent has at least one item, all items are allocated, and this distribution is relatively fair. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
```
