Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67   9  94  30  99  35
1  37  81  29  38  90  42
2  34  41  22   3  52  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 81 29 38 90 42]
 [34 41 22  3 52 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a balanced approach that aims to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 1.

Based on this, we can try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation across all agents.

The allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
