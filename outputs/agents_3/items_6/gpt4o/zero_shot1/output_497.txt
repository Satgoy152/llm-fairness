Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  40  74  49  22  42
1  49  12  61  13  91  16
2  50  41  56  76  60  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 12 61 13 91 16]
 [50 41 56 76 60 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign the item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 89)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 40)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 74)
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 76)
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 91)
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 49)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
