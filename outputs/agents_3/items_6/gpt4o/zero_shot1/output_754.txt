Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  10  73  86  32  72
1  82  42  76  23  44  54
2  66  56  67  56   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41 10 73 86 32 72]
 [82 42 76 23 44 54]
 [66 56 67 56  0 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We should ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [41, 10, 73, 86, 32, 72]
Agent 1: [82, 42, 76, 23, 44, 54]
Agent 2: [66, 56, 67, 56, 0, 91]
```

We'll proceed by assigning items based on each agent's highest preference that has not already been assigned. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value 86)
   - Second highest: 2 (value 73)
   - Third highest: 5 (value 72)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: 0 (value 82)
   - Second highest: 2 (value 76) [already allocated]
   - Third highest: 5 (value 54) [already allocated]
   - Next available highest: 1 (value 42)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: 5 (value 91) [already allocated]
   - Second highest: 2 (value 67) [already allocated]
   - Third highest: 0 (value 66) [already allocated]
   - Next available highest: 4 (value 0) [only remaining item]

Given this, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 4

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
