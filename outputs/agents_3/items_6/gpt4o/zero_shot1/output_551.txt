Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  59  18  85  74  68
1  96   2  17  88  26  12
2  72  99  91  59  87  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the table and distribute the items:

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 85
  - Item 4: 74
  - Item 5: 68

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 88
  - Item 4: 26
  - Item 5: 12

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 59
  - Item 4: 87
  - Item 5: 48

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (85)
   - Second highest value: Item 4 (74)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (96)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (99)
   - Second highest value: Item 2 (91)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest available values for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Items 3 and 4
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Assign Items 1 and 2

This leaves Item 5 unallocated. Let's assign it to the agent who values it the most among the remaining options:

- Agent 0: 68
- Agent 1: 12
- Agent 2: 48

Agent 0 values Item 5 the most, so assign it to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives the items they value most highly within the constraints.
