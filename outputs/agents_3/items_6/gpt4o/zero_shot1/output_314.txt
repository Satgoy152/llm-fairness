Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  16  23  61  29  96   7
1  54  73  43  43  24  86
2  94  19  95  31  70  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize fairness by trying to balance the total value of items each agent receives. One way to do this is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and try to distribute the remaining items to balance their total values.

Let's evaluate each agent's total value for possible allocations and attempt to distribute items such that the total valuations are as balanced as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (96), 2 (61), 3 (29)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (73), 5 (86), 0 (54)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (95), 0 (94), 4 (70)

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign each agent at least one item with a focus on maximizing their individual total value.
- A fair distribution aims to balance the total value rather than the number of items.

### Proposed Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign item 4 (96)
   - Assign item 3 (29)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign item 1 (73)
   - Assign item 5 (86)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign item 2 (95)
   - Assign item 0 (94)

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
