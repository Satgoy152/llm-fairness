Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  76  97  65   6  67
1  93  31  69  45  88  80
2  52  22  41  74   6  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 22 41 74  6 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets at least one item. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 2 (97), 1 (76), and 5 (67). Let's assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items for Agent 1 are items 0 (93), 5 (80), and 4 (88). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value items for Agent 2 are items 5 (93), 3 (74), and 0 (52). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 3, and 4) while trying to maximize each agent's valuation.

4. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest value item for them (76).

5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it has the highest remaining value for them (88).

6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest remaining value item (74).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
