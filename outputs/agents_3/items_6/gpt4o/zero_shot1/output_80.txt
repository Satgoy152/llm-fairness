Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  83  85  23  50  39
1  26  75  21  65  72  12
2  26  82  79  82  39  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 75 21 65 72 12]
 [26 82 79 82 39 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of items. Let's analyze the given valuations and make an allocation:

Valuations:
- Agent 0: [94, 83, 85, 23, 50, 39]
- Agent 1: [26, 75, 21, 65, 72, 12]
- Agent 2: [26, 82, 79, 82, 39, 59]

We want to distribute the items such that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first, ensuring no overlap:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (94).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (72).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (82).

2. Continue assigning the remaining items:
   - Agent 0's second highest valued item not already allocated is item 2 (85).
   - Agent 1's second highest valued item not already allocated is item 1 (75).
   - Agent 2's second highest valued item not already allocated is item 5 (59).

After the above allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, and all 6 items are allocated.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
