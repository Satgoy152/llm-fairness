Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  78  89  80  88  82
1  84  87  86  95  64  59
2  29   9  91  21  83  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In a simple approach, we can assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s the process:

1. For each item, identify the agent with the highest valuation.
2. Assign that item to the respective agent.
3. Ensure that each item is allocated only once.

Let's evaluate the items:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 57
  - Agent 1: 84 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 29
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 1: 
  - Agent 0: 78 (highest)
  - Agent 1: 87 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 9
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0: 89 (highest)
  - Agent 1: 86
  - Agent 2: 91 (highest)
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0: 80
  - Agent 1: 95 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 21
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 4: 
  - Agent 0: 88 (highest)
  - Agent 1: 64
  - Agent 2: 83
  - Assign to Agent 0

- Item 5: 
  - Agent 0: 82 (highest)
  - Agent 1: 59
  - Agent 2: 18
  - Assign to Agent 0

So the allocation of items based on the above valuation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in line with their highest valuations, and all six items are allocated.
