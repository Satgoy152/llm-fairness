Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  87  23  42  14  68
1  87  44  25  37  90  94
2  47   7   7  30  97  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 87 23 42 14 68]
 [87 44 25 37 90 94]
 [47  7  7 30 97 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's consider the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [51, 87, 23, 42, 14, 68]
Agent 1: [87, 44, 25, 37, 90, 94]
Agent 2: [47, 7, 7, 30, 97, 59]
```

We will assign items to agents based on the highest valuations for each item, taking care to ensure an even distribution:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is 87 (Agent 1)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is 87 (Agent 0)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is 25 (Agent 1)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is 42 (Agent 0)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is 97 (Agent 2)
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is 94 (Agent 1)

Looking at the above, Agent 1 is getting more items, so we need to adjust to ensure fairness:

- Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1
- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 0
- Assign **Item 2** to Agent 0 (since Agent 1 already has two items with high valuation)
- Assign **Item 3** to Agent 2 (to balance distribution)
- Assign **Item 4** to Agent 2
- Assign **Item 5** to Agent 1

Now the allocation is more balanced with each agent getting two items, and we ensure all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
