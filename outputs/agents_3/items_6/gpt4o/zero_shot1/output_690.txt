Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  77  63  47  18  98
1  50   8  60  30  13  75
2  89  24  64  76  56  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 24 64 76 56 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the highest valuation for each item:** 
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest (89).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest (77).
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest (64).
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest (76).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest (56).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (98).

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 2 gets items 0, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets no items as they have the lowest valuations for all items.

This allocation tries to maximize the total value assigned to each agent based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
