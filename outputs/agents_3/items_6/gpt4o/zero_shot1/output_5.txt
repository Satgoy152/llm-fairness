Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  39  40  58  26  72
1   0  36  13  74  59  54
2  15  40  69  85  11  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring fairness. A balanced approach is to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 39, 40, 58, 26, 72]
- Agent 1: [0, 36, 13, 74, 59, 54]
- Agent 2: [15, 40, 69, 85, 11, 11]

Steps to fairly allocate the items:

1. Determine which items are most valued by each agent and attempt to allocate those to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance total value among agents.

Allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (72).
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (74).
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (85), but since Agent 1 values it highly as well, we can give item 3 to Agent 1 and item 2 to Agent 2 (69).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (15) as it is relatively low valued by others and item 1 to Agent 0 (39).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (59) and item 3 to Agent 0 (58) to balance values.

After considering the valuations and fairly distributing the items, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items valued by them and attempts to balance the total value as evenly as possible among the agents.
