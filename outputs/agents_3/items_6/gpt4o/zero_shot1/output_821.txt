Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  99  61  22  79   3
1  24  73   3  20  13  47
2  96  55  50  36  43   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. There are multiple ways to define "fairness," but a common approach is to maximize the total value assigned to each agent based on their preferences.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 0: 47
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 2: 61
   - Item 3: 22
   - Item 4: 79
   - Item 5: 3

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 0: 24
   - Item 1: 73
   - Item 2: 3
   - Item 3: 20
   - Item 4: 13
   - Item 5: 47

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Item 0: 96
   - Item 1: 55
   - Item 2: 50
   - Item 3: 36
   - Item 4: 43
   - Item 5: 5

To allocate the items, let's consider the highest values each agent places on the items and attempt to maximize their satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: prefers item 1 (99) and item 4 (79)
- **Agent 1**: prefers item 5 (47) and item 1 (73)
- **Agent 2**: prefers item 0 (96) and item 2 (50)

### Allocation Decision

Based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each item is allocated only once, a potential allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 5, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's verify:

- **Agent 0** receives items 1 (value 99) and 4 (value 79)
- **Agent 1** receives items 5 (value 47) and 3 (value 20)
- **Agent 2** receives items 0 (value 96) and 2 (value 50)

The allocation is balanced in terms of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items in a way that tries to maximize their total valuation.
