Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  47  99   5  62  91
1  58  45  67  49  90  31
2  50  82  53  99  63  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents in a way that maximizes their valuations, we can follow a strategy that allocates items to the agent who values them the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Determine the highest value for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 58, Agent 2 at 50. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 at 45, Agent 2 at 82. Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 67, Agent 2 at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 49, Agent 2 at 99. Allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 90, Agent 2 at 63. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 31, Agent 2 at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate items based on the above allocations:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 5.
   - Agent 1 gets item 4.
   - Agent 2 gets items 1 and 3.

3. **Present the allocations in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most, and all 6 items are fairly distributed among the agents.
