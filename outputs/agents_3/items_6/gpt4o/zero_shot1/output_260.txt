Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40   6  36  20  13  95
1  41  90  90  36  75  13
2  83  62  58  50  61  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We need to consider the valuations and the constraints of having six items and three agents.

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly at 95.
   - Agent 1 values items 1 and 2 equally at 90, and item 4 at 75.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly at 83 and item 5 at 80.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign the highest valued items to agents where they have the highest relative valuation compared to other agents.
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
   - Distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

**Step-by-Step Allocation**:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them compared to other items.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them compared to other items.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them.

With these initial allocations:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]

**Remaining Items**: 2, 3, 4

- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 can receive item 2 since it provides a good value and balances the allocation.
- Finally, assign item 3 to Agent 0 to ensure all items are distributed.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [5, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]

**Json Format Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
