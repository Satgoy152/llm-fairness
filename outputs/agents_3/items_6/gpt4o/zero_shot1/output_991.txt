Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55   0  45  85  32  95
1  26  91  55  39  35  12
2  23  86  49  28  93   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 91 55 39 35 12]
 [23 86 49 28 93  6]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's total valuations**: [55, 0, 45, 85, 32, 95]
2. **Agent 1's total valuations**: [26, 91, 55, 39, 35, 12]
3. **Agent 2's total valuations**: [23, 86, 49, 28, 93, 6]

We'll try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives.

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (95) and 3 (85).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (91) and 2 (55).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (93) and 1 (86).

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 95).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 85).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 91).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 55).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 93).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 23).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their strongest preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives items with their highest valuations.
