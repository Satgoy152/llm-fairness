Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  12  80  23  34  53
1   3  78  14  30  78  47
2  63  51  55   3  53  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 51 55  3 53 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation for item 2, assigning item 2 to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction. Agent 0 also values item 5 relatively highly.
2. **Agent 1**: They have high valuations for items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 3.

Based on these observations, the allocation can be structured as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences and maximizes the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
