Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  84  40  85  81  24
1  13  44  67  32   6   5
2  61  72  59  16  61  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 84 40 85 81 24]
 [13 44 67 32  6  5]
 [61 72 59 16 61 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent as evenly as possible. We need to consider that each agent should receive items such that the overall distribution is fair.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [14, 84, 40, 85, 81, 24]
Agent 1: [13, 44, 67, 32, 6, 5]
Agent 2: [61, 72, 59, 16, 61, 12]
```

Let's try to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring a fair distribution.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (85), Item 1 (84)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (67), Item 1 (44)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (72), Item 0 (61)

From the above, we can see that item 1 is highly valued by all agents, so we'll need to balance this carefully. Let's try the following allocation strategy:

- Assign items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring fairness.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4 (85 + 81 = 166)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5 (67 + 5 = 72)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1 (61 + 72 = 133)

This allocation gives each agent a fair chance at high-value items and maximizes their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
