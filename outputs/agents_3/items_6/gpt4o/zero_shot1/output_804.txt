Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  26  49  58  86  47
1  34  56  84  59  30  78
2  41  83   7  66  42  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [41 83  7 66 42 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Let's examine the valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that ensures each agent receives items they value highly while considering a fair distribution.

Here are the valuations:

Agent 0: [17, 26, 49, 58, 86, 47]  
Agent 1: [34, 56, 84, 59, 30, 78]  
Agent 2: [41, 83,  7, 66, 42, 53]  

A strategy for fair allocation is to assign the items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that we have a fair distribution of items. Here's one way to do it:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (41)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (83)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (84)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (66)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (86)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (78)

Now, let's distribute these items as evenly as possible among the agents:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 3

This distribution considers the highest valuation for each item and tries to allocate the items evenly.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
