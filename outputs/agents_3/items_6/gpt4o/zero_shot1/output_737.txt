Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  81  45  76  51  46
1  45  90  17  96  63  87
2  97  76  86   6  86  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 76 86  6 86 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's review the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 86
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 45
- Item 3: 76
- Item 4: 51
- Item 5: 46

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 45
- Item 1: 90
- Item 2: 17
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 63
- Item 5: 87

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 97
- Item 1: 76
- Item 2: 86
- Item 3: 6
- Item 4: 86
- Item 5: 98

One possible allocation that maximizes satisfaction for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed fairly is:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3 (values 86 and 76)
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 5 (values 90 and 87)
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4 (values 86 and 86)

This allocation gives each agent two items, maximizing their total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
