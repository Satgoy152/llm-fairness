Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  27  92  22  23  48
1  61   1  99  45  95  99
2  56  12   4  26  84  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We can aim to maximize the total value for each agent by considering their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 0 and 2. We'll allocate these items to Agent 0.
   - Allocated items: [0, 2]
   
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 2, 4, and 5, but item 2 is already taken. We'll allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.
   - Allocated items: [4, 5]
   
3. **Agent 2** will receive the remaining items, which are 1 and 3.
   - Allocated items: [1, 3]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on the given valuations.
