Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  60  72  64  75   0
1  89  26  70  68  86  67
2  45  18   3  92  19  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 26 70 68 86 67]
 [45 18  3 92 19 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items to the 3 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share. We attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to one of the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 0: 49
  - 1: 60
  - 2: 72
  - 3: 64
  - 4: 75
  - 5: 0

- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0: 89
  - 1: 26
  - 2: 70
  - 3: 68
  - 4: 86
  - 5: 67

- Agent 2 values items:
  - 0: 45
  - 1: 18
  - 2: 3
  - 3: 92
  - 4: 19
  - 5: 73

Let's allocate items based on maximizing the individual agent's values while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent:

1. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (86). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
2. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (92). We allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 1 (89). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
4. Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 2 (73). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
5. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (72). We allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
6. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (60). We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Based on this allocation, the total value for each agent is maximized given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
