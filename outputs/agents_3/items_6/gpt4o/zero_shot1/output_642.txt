Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  26  64  41  17  98
1  55  87  75   4  81  44
2  82  43  61  44  97  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 43 61 44 97 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have 3 agents and 6 items. One approach is to try to assign items such that each agent's total value is relatively balanced or maximized.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High values: Item 0 (99), Item 5 (98)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High values: Item 1 (87), Item 4 (81)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High values: Item 4 (97), Item 5 (77)

Considering the above observations, we could try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
  - Total value = 99 + 64 = 163
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 4
  - Total value = 87 + 81 = 168
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 5
  - Total value = 44 + 77 = 121

This allocation tries to balance the total values each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
