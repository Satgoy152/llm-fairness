Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2   6  49  26  96  76
1  23  25  43  32   1  89
2  25  71  17  56   1  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 25 43 32  1 89]
 [25 71 17 56  1 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic that considers maximizing the value each agent assigns to the items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 4 with a value of 96.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 with a value of 89.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 71.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Remaining items to allocate: 0, 2, 3

4. **Agent 0** (next highest value):
   - Next highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 (already allocated), then item 2 with a value of 49.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1** (next highest value):
   - Next highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 with a value of 32.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2** (next highest value):
   - Next highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 25.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

All items have now been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
