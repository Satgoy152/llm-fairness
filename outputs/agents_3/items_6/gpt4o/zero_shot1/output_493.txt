Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  92  29  77  41  73
1  16  81  41  59  78   9
2  18  61  58  14  37  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 61 58 14 37 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Check which agent values each item the most and try to allocate accordingly.
2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item**: Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure fairness.
3. **Iterate for optimal allocation**: Continue adjusting to ensure that each agent receives as much value as possible.

Let's analyze:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 92 the highest.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 92 the highest.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 29 the highest.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 77 the highest.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 78 the highest.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 73 the highest.

To ensure each agent gets a fair allocation, we can first distribute the items based on the highest valuations and then adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 initially gets all the items because they have the highest valuation for each item.
- Redistribute items 4 and 5, since Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 and Agent 2 needs at least one item.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Item [4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5]

Now, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
