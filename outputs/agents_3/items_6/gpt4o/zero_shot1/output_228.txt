Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  16  72  89  80  65
1  14  19   3  41  99  32
2  35  32  58  46  67  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this problem by considering the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 4. To maximize their total value, we can assign items 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has the highest valuation for item 4, but since it is already allocated to Agent 0, we assign the next highest valued items that are available. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has decent valuations for items 0, 2, and 4. Since items 0 and 4 are already allocated, we assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 2, which are among the highest remaining valuations.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on the highest available valuations while all items are distributed. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
