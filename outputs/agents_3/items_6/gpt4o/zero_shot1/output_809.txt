Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  24  44  81  22  43
1  40  41  62  72  64  80
2  14  43   6  55  25   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 43  6 55 25  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [75, 24, 44, 81, 22, 43]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [40, 41, 62, 72, 64, 80]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [14, 43, 6, 55, 25, 9]

To distribute the items fairly, we can aim for maximizing the value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 81 - the highest single value).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 80 - the highest remaining value).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 62 - next highest and beneficial for Agent 1).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 75 - second highest for Agent 0).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 64 - beneficial for Agent 1).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 43 - highest value Agent 2 can get).

With this allocation, Agent 0 gets items 3 and 0, Agent 1 gets items 5, 2, and 4, and Agent 2 gets item 1. Each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
```
