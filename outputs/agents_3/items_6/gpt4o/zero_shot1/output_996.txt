Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  54  81  28   6   7
1  88  56   4  55  39  90
2  50  52  46  58  78  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will consider the values each agent assigns to each item and attempt to spread the higher values across agents.

Let's break down a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with highest values: Item 2 (81), Item 1 (54), Item 0 (48)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with highest values: Item 0 (88), Item 5 (90), Item 3 (55)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with highest values: Item 4 (78), Item 3 (58), Item 1 (52)

A fair allocation would be to distribute the items such that each agent is getting a fair share of high-value items according to their preferences.

Considering this, a possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items 0, 1

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items 2, 5

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items 3, 4

Here's how the allocation looks in json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
