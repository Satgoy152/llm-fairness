Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  80  40  14  31   9
1  97  94  16  14  47  27
2  12  45  65  81  62  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 80 40 14 31  9]
 [97 94 16 14 47 27]
 [12 45 65 81 62 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to assign items such that each agent's total value is relatively balanced, considering the relative preferences of each agent for the items.

Let's examine the values:

- Agent 0: 27, 80, 40, 14, 31, 9
- Agent 1: 97, 94, 16, 14, 47, 27
- Agent 2: 12, 45, 65, 81, 62, 62

One possible allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign the highest-priority item to each agent, then balance the rest:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (80), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (81), so assign item 3 to Agent 2.

After assigning the most preferred items, we distribute the remaining ones:

2. Next items:
   - Agent 1’s next highest is item 4 (47), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2’s next highest is item 2 (65), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Only item 5 is left, so assign it to Agent 0 since it is the least preferred among the remaining choices.

Now we check the allocations and their values:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5] (values 80, 9; total value = 89)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4] (values 97, 47; total value = 144)
- Agent 2: Items [3, 2] (values 81, 65; total value = 146)

This allocation is reasonably balanced and respects the individual preferences of each agent.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
