Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39   0  89  87  25  86
1  90  39  99  18  47  68
2  88  37  65  96   2  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Check which items Agent 0 values the most. The highest valuations for Agent 0 are items 2 (89) and 3 (87).

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 0 (90) and 2 (99). However, since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we'll consider the next highest, which are items 0 (90) and 5 (68).

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 3 (96) and 5 (90) the most. However, item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we'll allocate item 5.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 3 (valuations 89 and 87)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 1 (valuations 90 and 39)
- **Agent 2**: Items 4 and 5 (valuations 2 and 90)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations, with a fair distribution among the agents.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
