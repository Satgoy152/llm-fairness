Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3   3  80   2  60  47
1  70  37  10  55  22  69
2   1  45  17  84  94  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 37 10 55 22 69]
 [ 1 45 17 84 94 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly at 80 and item 4 at 60. 
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 70 and item 5 at 69.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 84 and item 4 at 94.

To allocate items fairly, we can prioritize giving the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most. Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it at 80, which is higher than any other agent values item 2.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it at 70, which is the highest valuation for item 0.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it at 94, which is the highest valuation for item 4.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it at 69, which is the highest valuation for item 5.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it at 84, which is the highest valuation for item 3.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 and Agent 2 have equal valuation for item 1, but Agent 0 has fewer items at this point.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
