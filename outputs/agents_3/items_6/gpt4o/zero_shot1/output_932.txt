Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  70  34  80  66  26
1  40  24  48  31  81  36
2  77  15  19  99  50  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 24 48 31 81 36]
 [77 15 19 99 50 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to aim for maximizing the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents in such a way that their individual valuations for those items are relatively high.

Let's evaluate each item's highest valuation and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 with 86.
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 with 70.
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 with 48.
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 with 99.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 with 81.
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 with 43.

Now, let's allocate these items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 should receive items that they value the most compared to others.
- Agent 1 should receive items they value the most compared to others.
- Agent 2 should receive items they value the most compared to others.

Based on the above, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting items they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
