Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  83   8  63   0  62
1  36  25  39  23  25  42
2   5   8  47  70  66  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the situation and assign the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. 
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 2.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.

Based on these observations, we can allocate items in a manner that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 because their valuations are the highest for these items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it the most compared to other agents.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 2 because their valuations are higher for these items.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it would increase their overall satisfaction more than the other agents.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their respective valuations.
