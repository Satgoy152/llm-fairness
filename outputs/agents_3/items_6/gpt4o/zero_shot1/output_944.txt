Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  84  56  30  43  30
1  18  48  41  16  85  83
2   3  72  20  50   2  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 48 41 16 85 83]
 [ 3 72 20 50  2 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocations maximize the total value for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the valuations of all items for each agent.
   - Agent 0: 93 + 84 + 56 + 30 + 43 + 30 = 336
   - Agent 1: 18 + 48 + 41 + 16 + 85 + 83 = 291
   - Agent 2: 3 + 72 + 20 + 50 + 2 + 40 = 187

2. **Assign Each Agent Their Highest Valued Item First**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item by assigning them their highest valued item.
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (Value = 93)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (Value = 85)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (Value = 50)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Assign the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 5

4. **Second Highest Priority Item Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (Value = 84)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (Value = 83)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (Value = 20)

This approach ensures that each agent receives items maximizing their valuation while ensuring fairness. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives their highest possible values based on the given constraints.
