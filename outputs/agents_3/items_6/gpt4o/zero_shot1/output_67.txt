Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74   0  54  20  25  93
1  21  67  58  53   1  71
2  18  68  17  79  68  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74  0 54 20 25 93]
 [21 67 58 53  1 71]
 [18 68 17 79 68 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive for different allocations.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing the total value each agent can receive while ensuring all items are allocated.

Based on the valuations provided, an effective allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 5 (total value = 74 + 93 = 167)
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 2 (total value = 67 + 58 = 125)
- Agent 2 gets items: 3, 4 (total value = 79 + 68 = 147)

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
