Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  83  34  81  76  15
1  70  38  74  92  72  93
2  62   6  98   9  65   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 38 74 92 72 93]
 [62  6 98  9 65  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider several approaches for allocation:

1. **Greedy Allocation:** Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

2. **Maximizing Total Value:** Allocate items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as high as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation by evaluating the valuations:

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 70
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 83
   - Agent 1 values it at 38
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value)

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 34
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 98
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value)

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 2 values it at 9
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 72
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value)

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 15
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 2 values it at 8
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value)

### Final Allocation:

Based on the highest valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
