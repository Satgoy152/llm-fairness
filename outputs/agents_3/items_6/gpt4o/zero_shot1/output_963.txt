Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  17  51  38  12  19
1  61  12  34   7  89  87
2  45  52  47  83  21  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and every item is allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 63.
   - Next highest values for Agent 0 are item 2 at 51 and item 3 at 38.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 89.
   - Next highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 at 87.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 83.
   - Next highest values for Agent 2 are item 5 at 65 and item 1 at 52.

However, we want to ensure a fair distribution, so let's summarize the distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are distributed. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
