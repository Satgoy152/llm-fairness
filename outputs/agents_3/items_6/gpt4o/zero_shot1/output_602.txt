Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  52  70  21  65  76
1  46  29  80  32  87  87
2  97  79  84  20   1  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 29 80 32 87 87]
 [97 79 84 20  1 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 91     | 52     | 70     | 21     | 65     | 76     |
| 1     | 46     | 29     | 80     | 32     | 87     | 87     |
| 2     | 97     | 79     | 84     | 20     | 1      | 11     |

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: To maximize Agent 0's value, we choose items with high valuations for them. Items 0, 5, and 2 are the highest for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: After assigning items to Agent 0, we choose items with high valuations for Agent 1. Item 4 is the highest for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Finally, we allocate remaining items to Agent 2. Items 3 and 1 are the remaining items.

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Item [4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 3]

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution, ensuring each agent receives items according to their highest valuation preferences while all items are allocated.
