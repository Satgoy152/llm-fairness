Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  37  26  77  52  52
1  89  43  24  43  43  80
2   7  86  97  39  89  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations. Each agent should ideally receive items for which they have higher valuations compared to the others. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations: Item 3 (77), Item 0 (68)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (80), Item 0 (89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 1 (86), Item 4 (89)

Let's allocate based on these preferences:

- **Agent 0** will get Item 3 (77) and Item 0 (68), given that these are the highest available items for them compared to what Agent 1 prefers.
  
- **Agent 1** will get Item 5 (80) and Item 4 (43), taking into account the highest available items considering Agent 2's high valuation for Item 2.

- **Agent 2** will get Item 2 (97) and Item 1 (86), as these have the highest value for Agent 2 and are still available.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total value, maximizing their satisfaction based on their preferences. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
