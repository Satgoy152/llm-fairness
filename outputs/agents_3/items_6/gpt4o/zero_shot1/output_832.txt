Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81   6  57  83   7  84
1  42  63  26  53  47  84
2  86  67  81  83  31  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81  6 57 83  7 84]
 [42 63 26 53 47 84]
 [86 67 81 83 31 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [81, 6, 57, 83, 7, 84]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [42, 63, 26, 53, 47, 84]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [86, 67, 81, 83, 31, 82]

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on the highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for item 5 (84), item 3 (83), and item 0 (81).
   - Tentatively allocate item 5 to agent 0 first.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for item 5 (84), item 1 (63), and item 3 (53).
   - Since item 5 is already taken, allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for item 0 (86), item 3 (83), and item 2 (81).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Continue allocating remaining items**:
   - For agent 0, allocate item 3 (second highest after 5 and 0).
   - For agent 1, allocate item 4 (47) as it provides the next highest value.
   - For agent 2, allocate item 2 (81).

After completing this allocation, each agent would have received a fair number of items based on their valuations. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
