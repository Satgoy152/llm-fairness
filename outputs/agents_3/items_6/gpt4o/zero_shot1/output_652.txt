Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  80  32   8  78   5
1  93   2  29  56  84  68
2   2  19  42  14   8  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value obtained by each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the maximum valuation for each item across the agents and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here are the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest (93)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest (80)
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest (42)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest (56)
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest (84)
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest (61)

Based on these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 1
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 3, and 4
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 5

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
