Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  45  21  62  96  56
1  38  80  84  38  96  73
2   4  47  51  42  23   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, one approach is to look at which items provide the maximum value to each agent and assign items accordingly.

Let's consider the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (96), Item 3 (62)
   - Allocate Item 3 and Item 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (96), Item 2 (84), Item 1 (80)
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (51), Item 1 (47)
   - Since Item 2 and Item 1 are already allocated, consider other items
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 5 to Agent 2

After considering these allocations, here is a fair distribution of items:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while all six items are distributed among the agents.
