Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  75  84  27  59  71
1  66  87  93  49  82  40
2  20   7  88  58  31  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. The goal here is to find an allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Item 0 (Value: 59)
   - Item 1 (Value: 75)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Item 2 (Value: 93)
   - Item 4 (Value: 82)

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Item 3 (Value: 58)
   - Item 5 (Value: 30)

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated. The assignment considers relatively high valuation preferences for the respective agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
