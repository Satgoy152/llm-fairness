Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  20  81  81  64  73
1  20  79   4  70  41  19
2   7  84  44   3  34  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 84 44  3 34 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has particularly high valuations for items 2 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 and 5.

A potential fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (high valuation for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (high valuation for Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (high valuation for Agent 2).

Now, let's look at the remaining items 0, 4, and 5:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 1 has a relatively higher valuation compared to others.

- Item 4:
  - Agent 1 has a medium valuation.
  
- Item 5:
  - Agent 2 has a high valuation.

Given these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

The allocations can be summarized in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their higher valuations, while also balancing the total number of items fairly.
