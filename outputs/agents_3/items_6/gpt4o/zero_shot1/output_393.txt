Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  86  86  22   0  87
1  23  86   5  97  20  84
2   3  54  35  91  56  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 54 35 91 56 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Values: [26, 86, 86, 22, 0, 87]

- Agent 1:
  - Values: [23, 86, 5, 97, 20, 84]

- Agent 2:
  - Values: [3, 54, 35, 91, 56, 70]

A fair allocation would consider the highest values each agent places on the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (87), Item 1 (86), Item 2 (86)
   - Let's allocate Item 5 and Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 1 (86), Item 5 (84)
   - Item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, so let's allocate Item 3 and Item 4 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a high-value item and another item.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (91), Item 5 (70), Item 4 (56)
   - Items 3 and 5 are already allocated, so let's allocate Item 2 and Item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuation while distributing all 6 items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
