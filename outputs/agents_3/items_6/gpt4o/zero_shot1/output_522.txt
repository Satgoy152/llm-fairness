Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  95  33  13  29   3
1  11  96  78  72  45   4
2   6   8  71  80   7  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 96 78 72 45  4]
 [ 6  8 71 80  7 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can use a simple greedy strategy to achieve this:

1. Calculate each agent's highest-valued item.
2. Assign each agent their highest-valued item if possible.
3. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [34, 95, 33, 13, 29, 3]
  - Highest value item: 1 (value = 95)

- Agent 1: [11, 96, 78, 72, 45, 4]
  - Highest value item: 1 (value = 96), but item 1 is taken by Agent 0
  - Next highest value item: 2 (value = 78)

- Agent 2: [6, 8, 71, 80, 7, 98]
  - Highest value item: 5 (value = 98)

Now, let's assign the items:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

For the remaining items (0, 3, 4), we need to distribute them to maximize the total valuation:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 34
  - Agent 1: 11
  - Agent 2: 6
  - Best choice: Agent 0 (value = 34)

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 13
  - Agent 1: 72
  - Agent 2: 80
  - Best choice: Agent 2 (value = 80)

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 29
  - Agent 1: 45
  - Agent 2: 7
  - Best choice: Agent 1 (value = 45)

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [1, 0]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [5, 3]

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
