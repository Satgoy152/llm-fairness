Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  31  60   3  63  65
1  93  17  31  63  30  75
2  61  78  85  63  21  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 31 60  3 63 65]
 [93 17 31 63 30 75]
 [61 78 85 63 21 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations assigned to each agent. We will use a simple greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 78
   - Item 5: Value 65

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 3: Value 63
   - Item 1: Value 17

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2: Value 85
   - Item 4: Value 21

### Final Allocation:

We will assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, such that each agent receives a fair share:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

Each agent gets two items, and all 6 items are allocated.
