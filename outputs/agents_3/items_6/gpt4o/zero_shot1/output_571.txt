Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  35  70  56  21  18
1  63  13  24  92  28  38
2  67  51  89   2  55  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value, while considering the total number of items available. One approach is to use a method like the "max-min fair share" or another heuristic that seeks to maximize each agent's minimum satisfaction.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to fairly distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 0.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.

Taking these into account, a fair allocation might be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and it tries to balance the value distribution reasonably based on the given valuations.
