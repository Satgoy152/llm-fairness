Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  80  29  43   1  32
1  23  85  26  89  85  80
2  38  76  98  50  36  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [38 76 98 50 36 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no more than two items, given there are three agents and six items. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent has for any item:**
   - Agent 0: Values item 1 the highest at 80.
   - Agent 1: Values item 3 the highest at 89.
   - Agent 2: Values item 2 the highest at 98.

2. **Assign these highest value items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 1.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 2.

3. **Allocate remaining items considering secondary preferences:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 4, and 5.
   - Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 0 at 52.
   - Agent 1 has the next highest value for item 5 at 80.
   - Agent 2 has the next highest value for item 4 at 36.

4. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 0 (total value = 80 + 52 = 132)
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 5 (total value = 89 + 80 = 169)
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 4 (total value = 98 + 36 = 134)

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
