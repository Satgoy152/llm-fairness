Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  94  61  50  68   6
1  67  27  37  57  16  67
2  78   0  28  32   7  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 4 94 61 50 68  6]
 [67 27 37 57 16 67]
 [78  0 28 32  7 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 3 agents and 6 items to allocate, with each agent ideally getting 2 items (since 6 items divided by 3 agents equals 2 items per agent).

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 94, 61, 50, 68, 6]
- Agent 1: [67, 27, 37, 57, 16, 67]
- Agent 2: [78, 0, 28, 32, 7, 99]

We'll allocate based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets 2 items.

**Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest-valued items: 1 (value 94) and 4 (value 68)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest-valued items: 0 (value 67) and 3 (value 57)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest-valued items: 5 (value 99) and 2 (value 28)

**Verification:**

- Total items allocated: 6
- Each agent receives 2 items.

Allocation is complete, and the JSON representation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```
