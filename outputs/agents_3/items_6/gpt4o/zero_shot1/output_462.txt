Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  96  14  65   3  74
1  74  40  36  70  63  69
2   1  41   0  88   3   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and distribute the items to maximize the overall satisfaction, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, a straightforward fair allocation is to give each agent 2 items.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: 81
   - Item 1: 96
   - Item 2: 14
   - Item 3: 65
   - Item 4: 3
   - Item 5: 74

   Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 1 and 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: 74
   - Item 1: 40
   - Item 2: 36
   - Item 3: 70
   - Item 4: 63
   - Item 5: 69

   Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items 3 and 5.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: 1
   - Item 1: 41
   - Item 2: 0
   - Item 3: 88
   - Item 4: 3
   - Item 5: 8

   Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, the second-highest item is 1.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and the overall satisfaction is balanced.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
