Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  21  20  92  45  46
1   8  77  47  89  83  99
2  67  78  89  48  17  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations. One way to approach this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible).

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 91.
   - Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Agent 2 values it at 67.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 21.
   - Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - Agent 2 values it at 78.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 20.
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Agent 2 values it at 89.
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (highest value).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Agent 1 values it at 89.
   - Agent 2 values it at 48.
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 45.
   - Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - Agent 2 values it at 17.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 46.
   - Agent 1 values it at 99.
   - Agent 2 values it at 48.
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value).

Now we have the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
