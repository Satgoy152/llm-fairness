Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  88  39  90  29  77
1  10  74   0   7  69  70
2  24  92  38  87  39  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 74  0  7 69 70]
 [24 92 38 87 39 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.

2. **Allocate the highest valued items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (90).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (70).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (92).

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0: Consider items with high values that have not been assigned yet. Item 0 has a value of 11 for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Consider items with high values that have not been assigned yet. Item 4 has a value of 69 for Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Consider remaining items, item 2 has a value of 38 for Agent 2.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (90) and Item 0 (11).
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (70) and Item 4 (69).
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (92) and Item 2 (38).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
