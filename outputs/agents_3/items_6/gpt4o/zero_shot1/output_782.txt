Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   7  90  32  58  99
1  78  54  44  76  30  31
2  94  97  55  97  37  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 54 44 76 30 31]
 [94 97 55 97 37 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (99), Item 2 (90)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (78), Item 3 (76)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 3 (97)

Given these valuations, a potential fair allocation could be:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it highly and has already received fewer items.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as they have some valuation for it, balancing the number of items.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize the satisfaction by considering their preferences.
