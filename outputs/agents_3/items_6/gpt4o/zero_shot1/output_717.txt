Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14   8  65  90  71   3
1   6  79  75  51  82  39
2  76  89   5  37  13  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items in a manner that attempts to maximize the total satisfaction or fairness among the agents. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Determine which items have the highest value for each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign the highest valued item to each agent as a starting point. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest value for each agent, ensuring that the total number of items allocated remains 6.

4. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure that all agents receive a fair number of items, considering their highest valued items.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most (90). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most (82). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the most (89). Assign item 1 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items. Let's allocate the remaining 3 items:

- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the next highest (76). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
- **Agent 1**: Next, values item 2 (75). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 0**: Finally, values item 5 (3, but itâ€™s the only item left). Assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, each agent has been allocated items, and all 6 items are assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.
