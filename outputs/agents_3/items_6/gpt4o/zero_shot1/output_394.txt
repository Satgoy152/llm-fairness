Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  18  16   4   4  71
1  99  54   2  77  64  44
2  48  65  82  66  84  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their assigned items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all six items are distributed. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value for item 0).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value for item 1).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Agent 2 values it at 82
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value for item 2).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value for item 3).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 64
   - Agent 2 values it at 84
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value for item 4).

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 71
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Agent 2 values it at 90
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value for item 5).

After assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all six items are distributed. Agent 0 receives no items in this allocation.
