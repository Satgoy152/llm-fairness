Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  13   0  65  86  53
1   8  73  83  72  96  20
2  41  70  72  23  67   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Look for the highest valuation each agent has for any item and try to allocate those items first if possible.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets Items:**
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, depending on their highest valuations.

3. **Maximize Total Valuation:**
   - Try to allocate items in such a way that the sum of the agents' valuations for their allocated items is maximized.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valuations are for item 4 (86) and item 3 (65).
  - Allocate items 3 and 4 to agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valuations are for item 4 (96) and item 2 (83).
  - Since item 4 is already allocated, allocate item 2 to agent 1.
  - Next highest valuation after item 2 is item 1 (73).
  - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valuations are for item 2 (72) and item 1 (70).
  - Since those items are allocated, next highest valuation is item 0 (41).
  - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.
  - Next, allocate item 5 (6) to agent 2, as it is the last remaining item.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, each agent has an integer number of items, and the allocation tries to respect the agents' valuations as much as possible.
