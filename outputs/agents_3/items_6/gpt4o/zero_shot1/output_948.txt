Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  65  75  87  76  61
1  50  26  59  26  19  49
2  87   4  40  86  34  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider their valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but the highest are for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most, but since Agent 0 also values item 2 highly, Agent 1 will get their next best option, item 5.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 and 3 the most, but since these are highly valued by Agent 0 as well, Agent 2 will get item 3.

Let's distribute the items:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0, since they have high valuations for these.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 0, as they are also valued and are not highly valued by other agents.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as this is the best available option.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, to maximize their valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to fairly satisfy the valuations of each agent.
