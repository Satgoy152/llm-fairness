Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  58  69  39  67  96
1   0   2  25  90  64  51
2  45  35  59  42  21  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 35 59 42 21 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring every agent gets at least one item. Here is one potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations for Agent 0.
   - Item 0: Valuation 99
   - Item 5: Valuation 96

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations for Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Valuation 90
   - Item 2: Valuation 25

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations for Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Valuation 21
   - Item 1: Valuation 35

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the agents' valuations based on the given table.
