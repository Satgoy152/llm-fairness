Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  42  79  22  51  55
1  26  98  64  32  74  19
2  85  97  56   8  70  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to maximize the total value for each agent, we can use a heuristic approach. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their total possible valuation.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, ensuring that each agent gets roughly an equal share of their total valuation.

Let's perform the allocation:

Agent 0's total valuation: 18 + 42 + 79 + 22 + 51 + 55 = 267  
Agent 1's total valuation: 26 + 98 + 64 + 32 + 74 + 19 = 313  
Agent 2's total valuation: 85 + 97 + 56 + 8 + 70 + 68 = 384  

We can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2 (79) and 5 (55)
- Agent 1: Items 1 (98) and 4 (74)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (85) and 3 (8)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuation items while ensuring each agent receives two items, aiming for a balanced distribution of total value.
