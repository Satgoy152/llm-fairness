Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  10  94  70  69  81
1  40   0  17  94  63  10
2  28  58  25  21  74  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each agent and try to allocate that item to them.**
2. **Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.**
3. **Distribute the remaining items based on maximizing the total valuation across agents.**

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Their highest valued item is item 2 (valuation 94). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Their highest valued item is item 3 (valuation 94). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Their highest valued item is item 4 (valuation 74). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items: 2, 3, and 4. We need to allocate 3 more items, ensuring fairness and maximizing total valuations.

- **Agent 0:** The next highest valued item available for Agent 0 is item 5 (valuation 81). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** The next highest valued item available for Agent 1 is item 0 (valuation 40). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** The next highest valued item available for Agent 2 is item 1 (valuation 58). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has 2 items, and all 6 items are allocated. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations as much as possible given the constraints.
