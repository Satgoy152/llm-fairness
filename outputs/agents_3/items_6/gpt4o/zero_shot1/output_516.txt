Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  65  96  30  63  48
1  62  95  15  10  95  86
2   1  44  69  84  44  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use an algorithm that aims for efficiency and fairness, such as maximizing the total utility or ensuring envy-freeness.

Let's evaluate the problem and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**  
   - High valuations are for items 2 (96) and 0 (77).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**  
   - High valuations are for items 1 (95) and 4 (95).

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**  
   - High valuations are for items 3 (84) and 2 (69).

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0** should get item 0 (value 77) and item 2 (value 96).
- **Agent 1** should get item 1 (value 95) and item 4 (value 95).
- **Agent 2** should get item 3 (value 84) and item 5 (value 42).

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
