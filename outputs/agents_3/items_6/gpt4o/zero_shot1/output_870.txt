Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  53  96   8  66  10
1  91  85  58   6  42  56
2  40  40  36  89  78  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value received by each agent as much as possible. One approach is to consider a "greedy" allocation strategy, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. However, since each agent must get an integer number of items and there are only 6 items available, we must carefully balance the distribution.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [26, 53, 96, 8, 66, 10]
   - Highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 4 (66)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [91, 85, 58, 6, 42, 56]
   - Highest values: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (85)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [40, 40, 36, 89, 78, 18]
   - Highest values: Item 3 (89), Item 4 (78)

Considering these preferences, we can allocate items as follows:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because it's the highest value for them.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because it's the highest value for them.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 because it's the highest value for them.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because it's the second highest value for them.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 because it's their next highest value after Item 2.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 because it's their next highest value after Item 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, maximizing their individual values based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
