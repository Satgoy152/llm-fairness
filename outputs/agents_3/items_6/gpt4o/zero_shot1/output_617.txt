Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  34  26  61  90  36
1   8  39  45  49  30  77
2  16  55  55   1  96   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. This problem appears to be a variant of the fair division problem, where the goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 90), Item 0 (value 65), Item 3 (value 61)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 77), Item 3 (value 49), Item 2 (value 45)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (value 96), Item 1 (value 55), Item 2 (value 55)

2. **Allocate items**:
   - Start with items that have the highest unique value for each agent to ensure fairness.
   - Avoid allocating the same item to multiple agents.
   - Try to maximize the total value each agent receives.

3. **Consider unique high-value items**:
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).

4. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - After allocating the highest unique items, allocate the remaining items to balance the overall distribution.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

The allocations ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and maximizes the value for each agent. 

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
