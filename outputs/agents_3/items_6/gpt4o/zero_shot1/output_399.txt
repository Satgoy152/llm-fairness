Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  38   8  68  76   9
1  16  95  46  86  54  92
2  28  96  69  20  95  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 96 69 20 95 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 38
- Item 2: 8
- Item 3: 68
- Item 4: 76
- Item 5: 9

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 95
- Item 2: 46
- Item 3: 86
- Item 4: 54
- Item 5: 92

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 28
- Item 1: 96
- Item 2: 69
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 95
- Item 5: 79

To balance the allocation, we could start by considering the highest valuations from each agent, ensuring that the allocation is fair and that each agent receives at least one item.

One possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items that are highly valued to them or have moderate values.
- Agent 1 receives items with high valuations.
- Agent 2 receives items with high valuations as well.

Here's one allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 receives Item 3 (68) and Item 4 (76).
2. Agent 1 receives Item 1 (95) and Item 5 (92).
3. Agent 2 receives Item 0 (28) and Item 2 (69).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items, and it attempts to distribute the items based on higher valuations.

The final allocation in json format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
