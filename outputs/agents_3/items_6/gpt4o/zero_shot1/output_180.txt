Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  10  31  95  21  66
1  62  99  52  10  61   2
2  68  62  36  81   3  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 62 36 81  3 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that strives to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this method to allocate the items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest value items are 3 (95), 5 (66), 0 (62)
- Agent 1's highest value items are 1 (99), 2 (52), 0 (62)
- Agent 2's highest value items are 3 (81), 0 (68), 1 (62)

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

1. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 (99).
2. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (95).
3. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (68).
4. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (61).
5. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (52).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 0 (66).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total allocation of items is 6.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 2],
    "2": [0]
}
```
