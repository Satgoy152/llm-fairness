Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  73  68   8  16  52
1  82   8  57  22  55  49
2  89  24  40  74  79  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 89 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 40
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.

Now, let's check the distribution:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: No items yet
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4, 5

To ensure fairness, we must reallocate so each agent gets at least one item. Let's adjust:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 3 (Reassign from Agent 2)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4, 5

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and stays within the total of 6 items.

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
