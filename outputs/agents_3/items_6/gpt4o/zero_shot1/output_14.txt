Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  92  59  51  59  46
1  24   9  95   7  71   2
2  45  66  10   7  69  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their total valuation, we can use a method that considers each agent's preference for the items. One common approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences:**
   - Check which agent values each item the most.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Ensure that the allocation is fair by making adjustments where necessary, so that each agent ends up with a similar number of items if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 45, highest among agents.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 92, highest among agents.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 95, highest among agents.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 51, highest among agents.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 71, highest among agents.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 81, highest among agents.

This allocation is somewhat balanced and maximizes valuation. Now, let's present it in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent.
