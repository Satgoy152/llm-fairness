Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  81   6  59  81  55
1  30  14  59  62  76  79
2  21  16   5  31  38  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 14 59 62 76 79]
 [21 16  5 31 38 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 51 + 81 + 6 + 59 + 81 + 55 = 333
   - Agent 1: 30 + 14 + 59 + 62 + 76 + 79 = 320
   - Agent 2: 21 + 16 + 5 + 31 + 38 + 50 = 161

2. The goal is to allocate items such that the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations. We can achieve this by considering both the total value and the number of items.

3. A possible allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 5
   - Agent 2: Item 2

Let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Value = 51 (item 0) + 81 (item 1) = 132
- Agent 1: Value = 62 (item 3) + 76 (item 4) + 79 (item 5) = 217
- Agent 2: Value = 5 (item 2)

This allocation gives each agent a fair portion based on their valuations and ensures all 6 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```
