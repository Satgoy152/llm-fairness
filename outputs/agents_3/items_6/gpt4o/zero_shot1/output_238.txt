Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  55  53  99  75  68
1  91  10  43   5  10   1
2  29  91  82  98  33  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 10 43  5 10  1]
 [29 91 82 98 33 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's examine the valuations for strategic allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 1 (55)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (91), Item 2 (43)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (91), Item 3 (98)

To allocate fairly, we can follow these steps:

- **Agent 0** receives their highest valuation items: Item 3 (99) and Item 1 (55).
- **Agent 1** receives their highest valuation items: Item 0 (91) and Item 2 (43).
- **Agent 2** receives the remaining items: Item 4 (33) and Item 5 (33).

This allocation strategy ensures each agent receives the highest possible valuation with the items they get, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
