Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  28  89   2  11  45
1  12  90  54  41  41  56
2  65  26  76  65  81  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 90 54 41 41 56]
 [65 26 76 65 81 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, as there are 6 items and 3 agents. We can use a simple greedy approach where we allocate the highest valued items for each agent iteratively until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [34, 28, 89, 2, 11, 45]
   - Highest valued item is item 2 with a value of 89.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [12, 90, 54, 41, 41, 56]
   - Highest valued item is item 1 with a value of 90.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [65, 26, 76, 65, 81, 53]
   - Highest valued item is item 4 with a value of 81.

Now, we allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

4. **Remaining items:** 0, 3, 5

We choose allocations aiming to keep the agents' total valuations as balanced as possible:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 2. Next highest valued item is item 5 (value 45). Allocate item 5.
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 1. Next highest valued item is item 5, but it's taken, so item 3 (value 41).
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 4. Next highest valued item is item 0 (value 65). Allocate item 0.

Final allocations:
- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 5
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 3
- **Agent 2:** Items 4, 0

Now, in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
