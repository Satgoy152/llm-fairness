Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44   4  48  55  77  38
1   2  33  53  63  67   8
2   2  85  44  50  60  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 33 53 63 67  8]
 [ 2 85 44 50 60 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuations of each agent for all items:
   - Agent 0: 44 + 4 + 48 + 55 + 77 + 38 = 266
   - Agent 1: 2 + 33 + 53 + 63 + 67 + 8 = 226
   - Agent 2: 2 + 85 + 44 + 50 + 60 + 96 = 337

2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's minimum satisfaction:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 highly (77), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 highly (63), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 highly (96), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

3. Allocate the remaining items to balance the total allocation:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (44).
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 2 (53).
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 1 (85).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to balance the total valuation across agents. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
