Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  42  98  61  83  63
1  68  27  76  74   0  10
2  20   0  14  57  32   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 27 76 74  0 10]
 [20  0 14 57 32  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 68, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 83, so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 74, so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
5. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 42, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Remaining item 5 has the highest value for agent 0 at 63, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the total value received by each agent.
