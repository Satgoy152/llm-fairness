Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  23  22  48  99  30
1  33  43   5  78  43  77
2  14   7  32  46  45  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. We'll aim to balance the distribution based on these values.

Let's consider this allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 4: Highest value (99) among all evaluations.
   - Item 0: Second highest value (76).
   - Item 3: Moderate value (48).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5: High value (77).
   - Item 1: Moderate value (43).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Highest relative value for this agent (32).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 3],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value based on their valuations while distributing all 6 items fairly among the three agents.
