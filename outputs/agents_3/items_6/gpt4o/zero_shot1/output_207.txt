Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  61  29  18  64  49
1  88  99  59  79  45   4
2  22  52   2   1  81  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 52  2  1 81 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method similar to the "Maximum Matching" or "Envy-Free Allocation" where each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total value, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0: [24, 61, 29, 18, 64, 49]
- Agent 1: [88, 99, 59, 79, 45, 4]
- Agent 2: [22, 52, 2, 1, 81, 27]

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is relatively balanced, and each agent gets at least one item.

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (99), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (81), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** has the second highest valuation for item 4 (64), but it's already allocated, so we allocate item 0 (24) to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 0 (88), but it's already allocated, so we allocate item 3 (79) to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** now can take item 5 (49), which is their next highest value.
6. **Agent 2** takes the remaining item 2 (2), which is the least value but ensures all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 2]

This ensures each agent receives items, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
