Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  86  60  15  62  47
1  53  17  44   2  53  80
2   4  58  63  30  88  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Identify Highest Preferences:**
   - For each agent, determine the items that have the highest values for the respective agent.

2. **Assign Items:**
   - Try to allocate items to each agent based on their highest preferences while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - Make sure every item is allocated to some agent, and no agent receives more than two items, as there are three agents and six items.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 86).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (value 80).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value 88).

After assigning these items, we continue assigning the remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

- Agent 0 can also be assigned item 2 (value 60).
- Agent 1 can be assigned item 0 (value 53).
- Agent 2 can take item 3 (value 30).

This way, each agent gets two items, and the allocation is both fair and complete.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
