Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  97  49  49  35  90
1  18  28  56  29  89  64
2  37  45  80  51  15  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7 97 49 49 35 90]
 [18 28 56 29 89 64]
 [37 45 80 51 15 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 6 items are allocated in total. 

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [7, 97, 49, 49, 35, 90]
Agent 1: [18, 28, 56, 29, 89, 64]
Agent 2: [37, 45, 80, 51, 15, 15]
```

A potential allocation strategy could be to prioritize items based on the highest value assigned by any agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (97) compared to the other agents.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (89) compared to the other agents.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (80) compared to the other agents.
4. Agent 0 also has a high valuation for item 5 (90).
5. Agent 1 has a reasonable valuation for item 3 (29).
6. Agent 2 can take item 0 as it values it more than the other agents (37).

Here's how the allocation could be structured:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 2

Thus, the JSON allocation would look like:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is six.
