Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  20  65   7  12  37
1  89  69  49  92  73  75
2  85  31  70  48  58  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 69 49 92 73 75]
 [85 31 70 48 58 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Analyze the valuations for each agent and each item.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes total satisfaction.

Let's go through the table:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 2 (65).
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0 (89) and 3 (92).
- Agent 2 has a high value for item 0 (85) but slightly lower than agent 1, so we consider other items for agent 2.

To maximize the total valuation, we can consider these allocations:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign items 0 and 3 to agent 1.
- Assign items 1, 4, and 5 to agent 2.

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 4, and 5.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
