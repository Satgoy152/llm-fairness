Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  82  97   9  97  20
1  75  26  91  33  19  63
2  39  70   1  79  51   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item across agents:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 75.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 82.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 79.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 63.

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:**
   - Agent 0 gets Items 1, 2, and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 5.
   - Agent 2 gets Item 3.

4. **Present the allocation in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their highest valuations.
