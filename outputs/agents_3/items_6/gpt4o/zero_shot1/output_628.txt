Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  52  34   5  69  93
1  72  60  73  54  11  16
2  45  49  19  82  75  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 49 19 82 75 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items (in this case, 2 items each since there are 6 items and 3 agents).

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [52, 52, 34, 5, 69, 93]
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 4 (69)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [72, 60, 73, 54, 11, 16]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (73), Item 0 (72)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Valuations: [45, 49, 19, 82, 75, 82]
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 5 (82) [However, Item 5 is already allocated, so we'll choose Item 4 (75) instead.]

Allocate the items based on these considerations:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
