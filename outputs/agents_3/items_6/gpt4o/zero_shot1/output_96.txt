Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  45  83  70  85  43
1  91  43  43  12  48   2
2  32   2  86  79  19  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 43 43 12 48  2]
 [32  2 86 79 19 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets, ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 seems to value items 4 and 2 highly (85 and 83 respectively).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (91) and a moderate value for item 4 (48).
3. Agent 2 values items 5 and 2 highly (94 and 86 respectively).

By considering these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
