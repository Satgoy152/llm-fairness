Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  59  97  41  68  11
1  26  14  26  15  42   5
2  74  73  46  83  37  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 59 97 41 68 11]
 [26 14 26 15 42  5]
 [74 73 46 83 37 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. We also aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, ensuring no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [33, 59, 97, 41, 68, 11]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [26, 14, 26, 15, 42, 5]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [74, 73, 46, 83, 37, 39]

We'll try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values item 2 the most (97), they should get item 2. Next, the highest value is item 1 (59), which is also a good choice for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 should get item 4 (42) as it is the most valuable to them compared to other items.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 (83) the most, so they should receive this item. They also have a high valuation for item 0 (74), so it makes sense for them to receive it as well.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate one more item, and item 5 is the remaining unallocated item.

4. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it as 11
   - Agent 1 values it as 5
   - Agent 2 values it as 39

Since Agent 2 values item 5 the most, it makes sense for them to receive it.

The final allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3, 5]

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
