Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13   2  18  26  75  66
1   1   9  54  84  13  64
2  45  72  81  59  30  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the agents' valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on the highest relative value each agent places on each item.

Let's consider the following steps to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the relative value each agent places on each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's process the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 45.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 72.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 81.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 69.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated:

Agent 0: Initially receives item 4.
Agent 1: Initially receives item 3.
Agent 2: Initially receives items 0, 1, 2, 5.

To balance the allocations better:

- Reallocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Reallocate item 1 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
