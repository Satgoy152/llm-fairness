Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58   9  58  64  21   1
1  40  35  49  62  71  59
2  81  73  64  39  73  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 35 49 62 71 59]
 [81 73 64 39 73 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies another's allocation. This is a classic fair division problem, often referred to as the "fair division of indivisible goods."

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 58, 9, 58, 64, 21, 1
Agent 1: 40, 35, 49, 62, 71, 59
Agent 2: 81, 73, 64, 39, 73, 52
```

Let's analyze the best allocation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.

One possible fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed is:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1]

This allocation considers that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items, and tries to balance the total value for each agent. Let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all 6 items are allocated and that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
