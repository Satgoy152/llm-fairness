Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  57  25  19  99  46
1  35  19  74  88  23  88
2  53  92   1  78  32  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Determine the highest valued items for each agent**.
2. **Ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent**.
3. **Ensure each agent receives a fair share of items**.

Let's analyze the potential allocations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest values are for item 4 (99), item 1 (57), and item 0 (27).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest values are for item 3 (88), item 5 (88), and item 2 (74).

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest values are for item 1 (92), item 3 (78), and item 0 (53).

Considering these valuations, we can attempt to maximize the total allocation value by considering which agent values each item highest:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values highest (53)
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values highest (92)
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values highest (74)
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values highest (88)
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values highest (99)
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values highest (88)

Based on this analysis, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 3, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1]

Now, let's present this allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
