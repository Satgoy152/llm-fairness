Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  45  11  62  16  23
1  99  27  43  52  13  55
2  77  14  58  96  10  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 14 58 96 10 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent receives approximately equal value based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 71
   - Item 1: Value 45

   Total value for Agent 0 = 71 + 45 = 116

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2: Value 43
   - Item 5: Value 55

   Total value for Agent 1 = 43 + 55 = 98

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 3: Value 96
   - Item 4: Value 10

   Total value for Agent 2 = 96 + 10 = 106

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, given the constraints.

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
