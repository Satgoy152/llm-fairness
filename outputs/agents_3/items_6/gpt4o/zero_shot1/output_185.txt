Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  50  16  42  48  19
1  67  77  24  86  98   9
2  95  67  41   0  42  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 77 24 86 98  9]
 [95 67 41  0 42 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We can use a greedy approach to ensure each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Below is the allocation that achieves this:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 67, and Agent 2 values it at 95. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.

2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 77, and Agent 2 values it at 67. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.

3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 24, and Agent 2 values it at 41. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.

4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 86, and Agent 2 values it at 0. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.

5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 values it at 98, and Agent 2 values it at 42. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.

6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 9, and Agent 2 values it at 13. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5.

Based on the above analysis, the allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
