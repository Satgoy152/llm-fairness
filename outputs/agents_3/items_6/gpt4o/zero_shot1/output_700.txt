Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  30  90  31  96  89
1  66  54  64  29  20  26
2  64  28  99  32  82  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 28 99 32 82 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method called the "maximum sum allocation," which aims to distribute items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:
   - Agent 0: 62 + 30 + 90 + 31 + 96 + 89 = 398
   - Agent 1: 66 + 54 + 64 + 29 + 20 + 26 = 259
   - Agent 2: 64 + 28 + 99 + 32 + 82 + 19 = 324

2. Allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent to ensure they get a fair share:

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (96), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (66), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (99), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Continue allocating the remaining items to balance the value:

   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 89, next highest priority).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 54, next highest priority).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 32, next highest priority).

This allocation gives a balanced distribution of the total values among the agents:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5] with a total value of 185
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1] with a total value of 120
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3] with a total value of 131

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
