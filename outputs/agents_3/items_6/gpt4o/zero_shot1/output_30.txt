Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42   2  50  70  77  53
1  59  49  81   9  37  29
2  21  62  23  52   0  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42  2 50 70 77 53]
 [59 49 81  9 37 29]
 [21 62 23 52  0 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning items to agents based on their highest personal valuations, ensuring no agent gets more than two items since there are three agents and six items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [42, 2, 50, 70, 77, 53]
- Agent 1: [59, 49, 81, 9, 37, 29]
- Agent 2: [21, 62, 23, 52, 0, 16]

We can assign items in the following way:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent:
    - Agent 0: Item 4 (value = 77)
    - Agent 1: Item 2 (value = 81)
    - Agent 2: Item 1 (value = 62)

2. Assign the second highest valued remaining item for each agent:
    - Agent 0: Item 3 (value = 70)
    - Agent 1: Item 0 (value = 59)
    - Agent 2: Item 5 (value = 16)

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
