Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  20  32  72  46  54
1  47  89  40  76  41  74
2  95  11  46  26  39  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, considering each agent's valuation, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning high-value items to each agent. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (72), Item 0 (63)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (89), Item 5 (74)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (95), Item 2 (46)

Let's distribute the items keeping in mind that each agent should receive a fair share based on their highest valuations:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (72), Item 0 to Agent 2 (95), and Item 1 to Agent 1 (89).
- Then, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation:
  - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (74), Item 2 to Agent 2 (46).
  - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (46).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives, considering their preferences.
