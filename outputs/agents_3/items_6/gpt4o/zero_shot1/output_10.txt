Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  87   2  93  30  34
1  33  86  82  92  49  66
2  34  36   4  19  55  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent by considering their preferences. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the overall distribution is fair in terms of the values assigned by the agents.

Let's approach the problem by examining each agent's valuations and allocating items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 1 (87), Item 5 (34)

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 2 (82), Item 1 (86)

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (55), Item 5 (49), Item 1 (36)

We attempt to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Allocate Item 3 (highest value for Agent 0, second highest for Agent 1)
  - Allocate Item 1 (second highest for Agent 0, also high for Agent 1)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Allocate Item 2 (high value for Agent 1 and not top for others)
  - Allocate Item 5 (decent value for Agent 1 and similar for others)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Allocate Item 4 (highest value for Agent 2, not highly valued by others)
  - Allocate Item 0 (low value for others but needed to ensure fairness)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```
