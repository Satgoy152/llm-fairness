Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  29  78  78  12  62
1  10  38  38  16  16  15
2  13  64  11  26  43  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. Since these are their highest valued items, they should be prioritized for Agent 0. Let's assign items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations but the highest values are for items 1 and 2. However, since item 2 has already been allocated to Agent 0, we will give Agent 1 their next highest valued item, which is item 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuations for items 1 and 4, but since item 1 is allocated to Agent 1, we will allocate item 4 to Agent 2. Additionally, Agent 2 has a decent valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2 as well.

After ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and only 6 items are allocated in total, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
