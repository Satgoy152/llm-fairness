Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  21  25   9  60  65
1  95  99   6  27  16  61
2  49  44  68  61  91  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. One approach is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 4 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high values for items 0 and 1.
3. Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 2 and item 3.

Based on these observations, one way to allocate the items is as follows:

- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.

This results in a distribution of items that considers the highest valuations for each agent. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items, and all six items are distributed among the three agents.
