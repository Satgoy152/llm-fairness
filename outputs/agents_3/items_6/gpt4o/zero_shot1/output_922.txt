Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  34  55  16  14  15
1  89  36  51  97  89  89
2  20  15  92  64  46  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [20 15 92 64 46 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify each agent's highest-value items.
2. Allocate items to agents starting with the highest valuation first, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
3. Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97), item 4 (89), and item 5 (89). Allocate items 3, 4, and 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (92). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (34). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Finally, item 0 is left and agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for it (20). Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
