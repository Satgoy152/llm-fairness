Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  34  65  25  10  74
1  91  48  21  94  11  67
2  29  92  49  15   6  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 48 21 94 11 67]
 [29 92 49 15  6 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation. We'll assign items to agents by looking at the highest valuations and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuations for items 3 and 0.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 1, 2, and 4.

After considering the valuations, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
