Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  18  31  55  65  66
1  81  95  96  34   7  49
2  79  54  94  77  80  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent**: This gives us an idea of how much each agent values all items collectively.
2. **Aim for Fair Allocation**: Each agent should ideally receive a share proportional to their total valuation. However, since we have a fixed number of items (6) and the need for integer allocations, we may prioritize giving high-value items to agents.

Let's calculate the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 36 + 18 + 31 + 55 + 65 + 66 = 271
- Agent 1: 81 + 95 + 96 + 34 + 7 + 49 = 362
- Agent 2: 79 + 54 + 94 + 77 + 80 + 44 = 428

**Allocation Steps**:

1. **Assign Items Based on the Highest Value Per Agent**: Each agent should get items they value the most, ensuring a fair approach.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item**: This prevents any agent from being left out entirely.

Let's assign the items based on these steps:

- **Agent 0**: Value of items in descending order: Item 5 (66), Item 4 (65), Item 3 (55)
- **Agent 1**: Value of items in descending order: Item 2 (96), Item 1 (95), Item 0 (81)
- **Agent 2**: Value of items in descending order: Item 4 (80), Item 2 (94), Item 3 (77)

**Final Allocation**:

- Agent 0: [5, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, maximizing the individual perceived value.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness by distributing items to maximize individual valuations while keeping the total number of allocated items to 6.
