Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  51  98  20   0  94
1  93  36  96  84  55  74
2  81  13  15  74  98  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 36 96 84 55 74]
 [81 13 15 74 98 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, or attempt to balance the value among agents. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items based on the valuations given:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: 5 (value 94), 2 (value 98)
   - Total value: 192

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3 (value 84), 0 (value 93)
   - Total value: 177

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 4 (value 98), 1 (value 13)
   - Total value: 111

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution attempts to balance the total value among them.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
