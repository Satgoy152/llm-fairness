Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  85  42  25  42  61
1  75  78  36  35  55  83
2  26  24   0  46  84  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the total value each agent receives is balanced as much as possible, while also giving each agent an integer number of items. We can attempt to maximize the value each agent gets and ensure a fair distribution of items. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 (value: 85)
   - Item 2 (value: 42)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 (value: 83)
   - Item 0 (value: 75)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (value: 84)
   - Item 3 (value: 46)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the distribution of items is fairly even based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
