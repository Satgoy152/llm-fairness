Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  76  19  60  15  85
1  17  70  27  35  61  28
2  92  63  17  65  21  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem of fairly allocating items to agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for fairness. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets some items, and the overall satisfaction or valuation is maximized.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0, 3, and 5.

Considering these points, we can allocate items to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 5. 
   - Valuations: 76 (item 1) + 85 (item 5) = 161

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2 and 4.
   - Valuations: 27 (item 2) + 61 (item 4) = 88

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 3.
   - Valuations: 92 (item 0) + 65 (item 3) = 157

This allocation makes sure each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is reasonably high.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
