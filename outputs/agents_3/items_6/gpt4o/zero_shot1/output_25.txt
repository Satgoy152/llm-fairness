Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  62  29  78  95  28
1  42  26  27  77  30  77
2  69  59  95  48  37  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we want to maximize the satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that all 6 items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 25 + 62 + 29 + 78 + 95 + 28 = 317
   - Agent 1: 42 + 26 + 27 + 77 + 30 + 77 = 279
   - Agent 2: 69 + 59 + 95 + 48 + 37 + 34 = 342

2. Next, we can decide on a reasonable allocation based on maximizing each agent's total satisfaction while ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

3. Allocate items:
   - Agent 0 has a high value for items 4 and 3, so we'll allocate these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values items 3 and 5, but since item 3 is already allocated, we'll give them items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2, so we allocate item 2. We'll also allocate items 0 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values it significantly, and it hasn't been allocated yet.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a reasonably valued set of items.
