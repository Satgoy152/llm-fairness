Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  76  81  61   2  95
1  46  71  74  49  30   7
2  89  27   7  33  90  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 27  7 33 90 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. One approach is to iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 33.
   - Agent 1 values it at 46.
   - Agent 2 values it at 89.  
   Agent 2 values it the most, so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 76.
   - Agent 1 values it at 71.
   - Agent 2 values it at 27.  
   Agent 0 values it the most, so assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 81.
   - Agent 1 values it at 74.
   - Agent 2 values it at 7.  
   Agent 0 values it the most, so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 61.
   - Agent 1 values it at 49.
   - Agent 2 values it at 33.  
   Agent 0 values it the most, so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 2.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Agent 2 values it at 90.  
   Agent 2 values it the most, so assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 95.
   - Agent 1 values it at 7.
   - Agent 2 values it at 42.  
   Agent 0 values it the most, so assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets Items: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets Items: 0, 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
