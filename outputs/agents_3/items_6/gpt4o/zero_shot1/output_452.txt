Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  16  57  89  74  58
1  73  31  55  77  20  13
2  10  49  92   2  95  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's start by evaluating the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 4: 74
  - Item 5: 58

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 77
  - Item 4: 20
  - Item 5: 13

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 2
  - Item 4: 95
  - Item 5: 37

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (value 89) is the highest valued for Agent 0.
   - Item 0 (value 74) is the second-highest valued and not critical to other agents.
   - Item 4 (value 74) is also high-valued.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 and Item 0 are already taken by Agent 0.
   - Item 2 (value 55) is the next best option.
   - Item 1 (value 31) is selected for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Item 2 is already taken by Agent 1.
   - Item 5 (value 37) is the best option available.
   - Item 1 is already taken by Agent 1.
   - Item 0 is already taken by Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 as a lesser valued but available option.

Here is a fair allocation across the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
