Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  75  70   7  27  58
1  85  59  99  92  94  54
2  10  64  80  72  74  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's an allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 85 (highest).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 75 (highest).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 99 (highest).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 92 (highest).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 94 (highest).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 58 (highest).

Based on this strategy, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: []

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated while maximizing the perceived value for each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```
