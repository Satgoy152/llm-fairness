Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  58  85  20  83  41
1  35  56  56   3  78  91
2  35  13  95  21  28  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. This is often done using algorithms that consider fairness and efficiency, like the "max-min fair share" or "envy-free" principles. However, since this is a small problem, we can solve it directly by checking different allocations to find a reasonable distribution. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 20
  - Item 4: 83
  - Item 5: 41

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 3
  - Item 4: 78
  - Item 5: 91

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 21
  - Item 4: 28
  - Item 5: 19

One possible fair allocation could be:

1. Assign items that have the highest unique value for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2 and highest value overall).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 among remaining items).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they highly value, maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
