Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  82  52  98   8  16
1  67  25  38   8  79  90
2  49  77  29  93  52  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Analyze the highest valuations each agent has for the items:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (82) and 3 (98).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5 (90) and 4 (79).
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 (93) and 1 (77).

2. We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share of their high-value items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 6.

Based on this analysis, a fair allocation could be:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 98).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 77).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 90).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 79).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 37).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 29).

This allocation gives each agent a relatively high-value and ensures all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
