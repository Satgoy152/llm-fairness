Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  38  17  89  53  26
1  55  17  14  78  76  59
2  61  75  64  50  86  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a method like maximizing each agent's total valuation. However, given the constraints, we can also use a simple heuristic to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing individual preferences for a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most.

After these highest valuations, we allocate the remaining items based on the next highest values for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 0 (values: 89 and 82).
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5 (values: 76 and 59).
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 2 (values: 75 and 64).

This way, each agent gets 2 items, and all 6 items are allocated. The allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly.

The allocations presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
