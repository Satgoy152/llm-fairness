Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  72  59  79  44  80
1  52  16  96  99  72  17
2  79  24  62  74  98  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 16 96 99 72 17]
 [79 24 62 74 98 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we can use the "maximum sum" approach, which aims to maximize the total value achieved by each agent. We will assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 92
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 values it at 79
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 92)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 24
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 72)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 96)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 99)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 72
   - Agent 2 values it at 98
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 98)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 80
   - Agent 1 values it at 17
   - Agent 2 values it at 25
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 80)

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
