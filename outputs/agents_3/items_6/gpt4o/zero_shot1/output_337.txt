Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  74  53  91  36  32
1  39  39  50  42  56  88
2  26  40   1  32  67  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 74 53 91 36 32]
 [39 39 50 42 56 88]
 [26 40  1 32 67 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  74  53  91  36  32
1  39  39  50  42  56  88
2  26  40   1  32  67  52
```

First, let's identify the highest value each agent has for any item:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 91 for item 3.
- Agent 1: Highest value is 88 for item 5.
- Agent 2: Highest value is 67 for item 4.

Let's assign these items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 1, and 2.

Checking the remaining highest values for the unallocated items:

- For item 0, Agent 0 has the highest value (50).
- For item 1, Agent 0 has the highest value (74).
- For item 2, Agent 1 has the highest value (50).

After allocating based on these priorities, the allocation becomes:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0, and 1.
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 2.
- Agent 2: Item 4.

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```
