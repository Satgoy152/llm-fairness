Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  59  67  74  11  92
1  96   7  74  73  42  51
2  95  28  36   1  77  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (92), followed by item 3 (74), and then item 2 (67). 
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (96), followed by item 2 (74), and then item 3 (73).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (95), but since it is taken, we go to the next highest, item 4 (77), followed by item 1 (28), and then item 2 (36).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Assign remaining items:**
   - Items 1, 2, and 3 are left to allocate.
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 3 (74), assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 (74), assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, assign item 1 to Agent 2, who values it at 28.

With these steps, the allocation tries to optimize satisfaction based on the given valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving a reasonable share based on their preferences.
