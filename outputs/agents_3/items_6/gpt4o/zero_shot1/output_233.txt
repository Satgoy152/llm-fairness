Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  56  34  45  10  72
1  97  29  47  96  35  32
2  35  98  42  94  13  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction or total valuation of items for each agent. This can be approached by ensuring each agent gets the items they value the most, while also considering an equitable distribution of items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:
- Each agent will receive 2 items since there are 6 items and 3 agents.

Analyzing the valuations:

**Agent 0:**
- Highest valuations: Item 5 (72), Item 0 (64)

**Agent 1:**
- Highest valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 3 (96)

**Agent 2:**
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 3 (94)

To ensure the highest total satisfaction:
- Assign Agent 0 items 5 and 0, which are their highest valued.
- Assign Agent 1 items 3 and 2. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1, and item 2 is less contested.
- Assign Agent 2 items 1 and 4. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2, and item 4 is less contested.

Here's the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by giving them the items with their highest valuations while fairly distributing the total number of items.
