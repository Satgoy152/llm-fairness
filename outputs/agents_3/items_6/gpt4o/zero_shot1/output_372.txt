Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  58  11  45  51  44
1  61  93  12  78  22   3
2  29  68  52   5  33  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized. One approach is to use a method like the "max sum" or "maximin" to distribute the items in a way that is considered fair.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 3
   - Total Value: 36 + 45 = 81

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 4
   - Total Value: 93 + 22 = 115

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 5
   - Total Value: 52 + 67 = 119

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives, considering their individual preferences based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
