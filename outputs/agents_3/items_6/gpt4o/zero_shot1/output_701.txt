Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90   2   0  61  29  33
1  28   2   1  56  44  39
2  38  92  66  78  97  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90  2  0 61 29 33]
 [28  2  1 56 44 39]
 [38 92 66 78 97 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 90. We'll assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations, but they value item 4 the most with 44. We'll assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most with 92. We'll assign item 1 to agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items (0, 1, and 4) and have 3 items left to allocate (2, 3, and 5). Let's proceed:

4. **Agent 2** values item 3 second highest with 78. We'll assign item 3 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 2** values item 5 third highest with 47. We'll assign item 5 to agent 2.
6. **Agent 1** values item 2 the least with 1, but agent 0 values it at 0. We'll assign item 2 to agent 1 since itâ€™s the least valued by both agents and doesn't significantly impact their satisfaction.

With this allocation, each agent receives items in a way that optimizes their satisfaction based on their preferences. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
