Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  17  78  11  76  43
1  23  42  82  70  65  20
2  57  18  39  70  20  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Since we want to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share, we can try to assign items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "highest bidder" method, but given the constraints, we will use a simple heuristic approach to balance the allocation.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0: [20, 17, 78, 11, 76, 43]
- Agent 1: [23, 42, 82, 70, 65, 20]
- Agent 2: [57, 18, 39, 70, 20, 38]

Our goal is to distribute these 6 items among the 3 agents. We will look to distribute them such that each agent gets two items, and we attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent initially:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (78)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (82)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (57)

2. Next, assign the second highest valued item to each agent from the remaining items:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (76)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (70)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (70)

3. Since we have conflicting assignments, let's adjust:
   - Agent 0: Items 2 (78), 4 (76)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (42), 3 (70)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (57), 5 (38)

Now, let's list the final allocation to ensure each agent receives two items:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated.
