Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  15  44  79   6  48
1  50  90  57  76  77  33
2  37  68  66  17  97  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 15 44 79  6 48]
 [50 90 57 76 77 33]
 [37 68 66 17 97 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent. However, we also want to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the allocation is balanced.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest value to each agent first if possible.
2. Adjust the remaining items to ensure all items are allocated with a balance in mind.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [97, 15, 44, 79, 6, 48]
- Agent 1: [50, 90, 57, 76, 77, 33]
- Agent 2: [37, 68, 66, 17, 97, 31]

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 97 for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 90 for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 97 for item 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Agent 2 has a high valuation of 66.
- Item 3: Agent 0 has a high valuation of 79.
- Item 5: Agent 1 has a decent valuation of 33.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

Each agent gets 2 items in this allocation, and the total valuation for each agent is fairly distributed based on their preferences.
