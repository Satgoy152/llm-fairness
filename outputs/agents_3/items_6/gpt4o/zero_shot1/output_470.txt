Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71   1  59  32  13  14
1  97   4  61  31  67  65
2  69  96  41  10  28  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider different methods such as maximizing the total value for each agent or balancing the value distribution. Since fairness can be subjective, one approach is to distribute items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (71), 2 (59), 3 (32)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (97), 4 (67), 5 (65)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (96), 0 (69), 5 (49)

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Allocate item 0**: Agent 1 values it highest with 97, followed by Agent 0 with 71, and Agent 2 with 69.
- **Allocate item 1**: Agent 2 values it highest with 96.
- **Allocate item 2**: Agent 0 values it highest with 59.
- **Allocate item 3**: Agent 0 values it highest with 32.
- **Allocate item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest with 67.
- **Allocate item 5**: Agent 1 values it highest with 65.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4, 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 1

This distribution gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
```
