Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  84   0  13   1  62
1  38  13  73  51  24  99
2  46  24  16  75  33  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest values while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's follow these steps:

1. **List each agent's valuations for each item:**

   - Agent 0: [65, 84, 0, 13, 1, 62]
   - Agent 1: [38, 13, 73, 51, 24, 99]
   - Agent 2: [46, 24, 16, 75, 33, 13]

2. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 (65)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (84)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (73)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (75)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (33)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (99)

3. **Allocate items to agents based on these maximum valuations:**

   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value the most, and all items are distributed. Let's present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and that the allocation is fair, considering the valuations provided.
