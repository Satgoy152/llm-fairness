Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  84  28  98  47  95
1  53  66  77  15  47  57
2  78  99  98  28  36   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations for the items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:** Agent 0 values items 3 and 5 the most (98 and 95, respectively). We'll give these two items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:** After removing items 3 and 5, Agent 1's highest remaining valuation is for item 2 (77). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations:** After removing item 2, Agent 2's highest remaining valuation is for item 1 (99). We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining items:** Items 0 and 4 are left. We will allocate these remaining items based on who values them the most among those who don't already have two items.

   - For item 0: Agent 2 values it at 78, which is the highest remaining valuation. We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

   - For item 4: Agent 0 values it at 47, and Agent 1 also values it at 47, but Agent 0 already has two items, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, while all items are distributed.
