Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  13  31  91   9  68
1   6  68  16  92  36  75
2  13  59   7   7  12  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We must also ensure that all six items are allocated. Here's one potential approach:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 91, so assign item 3 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 92, but since item 3 is already assigned, assign their next highest, item 1 (68).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 59, but item 1 is already taken, so assign their next highest, item 5 (48).

2. **Continue assigning remaining items:**
   - Agent 0’s next highest available item is item 5 at 68, but it's assigned to agent 2. The next available item is 0 (18), assign it to agent 0.
   - Agent 1’s next highest available item is item 5 at 75, but it's assigned to agent 2. The next available item is 4 (36), assign it to agent 1.
   - Agent 2’s next highest available is item 0 at 13, but it's taken. The next available item is 2 (7), assign it to agent 2.
   - Assign remaining item 4 to agent 0 as it gives them a moderately high value (9).

3. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure that all items are allocated.
   - Verify that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Following this allocation strategy, the distribution is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
