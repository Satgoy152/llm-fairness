Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  42  36  36  78  82
1  25  54  99  52  12  44
2  98  85  82  17  97  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's attempt to do this by considering each agent's highest valued items.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items: 5 (82), 4 (78), 1 (42).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (99).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuations for items: 0 (98), 4 (97), 1 (85).

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (99).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (98).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (82).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the second-highest valuation for it (97).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it (85).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 still needs an item and it is next highest valued (52).

This results in a fair allocation where each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives item 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 1, and 4.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
