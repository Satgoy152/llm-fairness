Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  50  26  16  89  49
1  92  50  48  13  86  71
2  26  82  44  11  35  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their own value while ensuring that all items are distributed. One approach is to use a method that considers each agent's highest-valued items, ensuring a somewhat even distribution by value. Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so they can be allocated item 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so they can be allocated item 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so they can be allocated item 5.
- Then, we continue allocating items by moving to the next highest available valued item for each agent:

  - Agent 0's next highest valued item is 4, which hasn't been allocated yet.
  - Agent 1's next highest valued item is 4, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
  - Agent 2's next highest valued item is 1, which is already taken, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.

This leaves us with the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the value for each agent based on their preferences.
