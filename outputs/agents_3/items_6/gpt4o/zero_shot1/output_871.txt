Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  75   5  94  51  61
1  27   3  20  82  65  70
2  43  85  64  94  55  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes their total perceived value or ensures a fair distribution. One possible approach is to allocate items such that the total value is balanced among the agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 1 and 2.

Using this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they have a relatively high valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they have a high valuation.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0, as they have a low valuation but it's the remaining item with relatively less contention.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
