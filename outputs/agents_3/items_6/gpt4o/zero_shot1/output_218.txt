Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  71   2  53  84  75
1  96  89  12  49   7  98
2  75  44  58  43  81   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive while also ensuring that every agent is considered in the allocation process. Since there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Evaluate the highest values for Agent 0.
   - Highest values are for items 4 (84) and 5 (75).

2. **Agent 1**: Evaluate the highest values for Agent 1.
   - Highest values are for items 5 (98) and 0 (96).

3. **Agent 2**: Evaluate the highest values for Agent 2.
   - Highest values are for items 0 (75) and 4 (81).

Considering these preferences, we need to ensure that each agent receives items without overlap and maintains fairness:

- Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 0. 
- Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 1. 
- Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent two items and maximizes their total value based on the provided table, ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
