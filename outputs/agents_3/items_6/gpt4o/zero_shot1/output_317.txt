Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  78  69  74  32  73
1   4   2  30  91  42  31
2  87  92  67  75   3  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign Items to Agents:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent, then proceed to the next highest, ensuring each agent gets approximately equal total value or number of items.

2. **Evaluate Valuations:**

   | Agent | Items Valuations     |
   |-------|----------------------|
   | 0     | [53, 78, 69, 74, 32, 73] |
   | 1     | [4, 2, 30, 91, 42, 31]  |
   | 2     | [87, 92, 67, 75, 3, 95] |

3. **Item Assignments:**
   - Assign item 2 (highest value for agent 0) to agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 (highest value for agent 1) to agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 (highest value for agent 2) to agent 2.
   - Continue assigning the next highest valued items while considering the balance of total values.

4. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 4
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 5

5. **Verify Total Items Allocated:**
   - Total allocated items = 6 (correct)

6. **JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their individual valuations.
