Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  12  51   4  83  93
1  67  90  23  36  44  45
2  37  63  66  77   7  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 63 66 77  7 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations for each item, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Let's consider how to allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0 (Valuations):**  
   - Items: 0 (89), 1 (12), 2 (51), 3 (4), 4 (83), 5 (93)

2. **Agent 1 (Valuations):**  
   - Items: 0 (67), 1 (90), 2 (23), 3 (36), 4 (44), 5 (45)

3. **Agent 2 (Valuations):**  
   - Items: 0 (37), 1 (63), 2 (66), 3 (77), 4 (7), 5 (80)

We'll try to assign items to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (89), then Agent 1 (67), and Agent 2 (37). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Highest value is for Agent 1 (90), then Agent 2 (63), and Agent 0 (12). Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Highest value is for Agent 2 (66), then Agent 0 (51), and Agent 1 (23). Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 3:** Highest value is for Agent 2 (77), then Agent 1 (36), and Agent 0 (4). Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 4:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (83), then Agent 1 (44), and Agent 2 (7). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is for Agent 0 (93), then Agent 2 (80), and Agent 1 (45). Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
