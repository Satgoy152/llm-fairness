Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  73  84  61  91   0
1   2  90  61  76  11  94
2  37  25   7  96  52  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 73 84 61 91  0]
 [ 2 90 61 76 11 94]
 [37 25  7 96 52 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [29, 73, 84, 61, 91, 0]
- Agent 1: [2, 90, 61, 76, 11, 94]
- Agent 2: [37, 25, 7, 96, 52, 15]

We'll try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent, while also ensuring a fair distribution. We will proceed by checking the highest value of each item among all agents and allocate accordingly.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 29.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 84.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 91.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 94.

The allocation based on maximizing each agent's valuation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
