Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  28  75  89  42  91
1  55  34  92   0  47   9
2  64  73  88  46  79  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we first consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Review the valuations to understand which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Attempt to allocate items based on highest individual valuations to each agent.

3. **Balance Allocation**: Ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items, considering their preferences as much as possible.

4. **Adjustments**: Make necessary adjustments to ensure all items are allocated and each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Applying these steps to the given data:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (91), followed by item 3 (89).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (92), followed by item 0 (55).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (93), followed by item 2 (88).

Allocate highest valued items first, then distribute the rest:

- Give Agent 0 item 3.
- Give Agent 1 items 0 and 2.
- Give Agent 2 items 1, 4, and 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
