Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  59   5  66  23  64
1  89  92  99  39  74  16
2  14  29  84  46  56  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 29 84 46 56 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute them such that each agent's allocation is as close to fair as possible.

First, let's examine the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: [9, 59, 5, 66, 23, 64]
- Agent 1: [89, 92, 99, 39, 74, 16]
- Agent 2: [14, 29, 84, 46, 56, 62]

A potential strategy is to allocate the items so that each agent receives the items they value most. We will do the following:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent, ensuring no conflicts.
2. Continue assigning items in descending order of value, maintaining fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (66), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (62), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 1 values item 1 next (92), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 1 values item 0 next (89), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
6. Agent 2 values item 4 next (56), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now we have assigned all items, ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
