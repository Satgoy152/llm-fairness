Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  58  96  30  86  26
1  76  23  64  18  71  28
2  68   3  71  45  90  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Since there are three agents and six items, each agent should get two items. We'll use a simple greedy approach to assign the items to the agents, focusing on maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (96) and Item 4 (86)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (76) and Item 4 (71)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: Item 4 (90) and Item 5 (81)

Since item 4 is highly valued by all the agents, we need to allocate it strategically. Let's find a possible allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for this item).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest available for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest available for Agent 1).

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
