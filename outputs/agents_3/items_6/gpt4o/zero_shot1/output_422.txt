Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  87  96  83  28  30
1  81  43  62  16  29  60
2  69  14  14   3  95   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 87 96 83 28 30]
 [81 43 62 16 29 60]
 [69 14 14  3 95  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One simple approach is to allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation, then allocate the remaining items by considering the next-highest valuations among the unallocated items.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  87  96  83  28  30
1  81  43  62  16  29  60
2  69  14  14   3  95   9
```

### Step 1: Allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation:
- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 2 (96)
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 0 (81)
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 4 (95)

This allocates items 2, 0, and 4.

### Step 2: Allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations:
- Remaining items: 1, 3, 5
- Agent 0: Next highest valuation is for item 1 (87)
- Agent 1: Next highest valuation is for item 2, but it's already taken, so item 5 (60)
- Agent 2: Next highest valuation is for item 0, but it's already taken, so item 1 (14)

Now let's distribute the remaining items:
- Agent 0: Item 1 (87)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (60)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (3)

### Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 4, 3

Now, in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```

This ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
