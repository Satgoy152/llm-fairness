Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  10  36  67  30   0
1  67  20  58  36  83  35
2  60  31  75   0  31   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [60 31 75  0 31  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize the total satisfaction or utility for everyone. One common approach is to use a method like the "maximum utilitarian allocation," which seeks to maximize the total sum of the agents' utilities, or to ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly at 70, so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 83, so item 4 is allocated to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 75, so item 2 is allocated to Agent 2.
4. For item 3, Agent 0 values it at 67, which is higher than the others, so item 3 goes to Agent 0.
5. For item 1, Agent 2 values it at 31, which is the highest valuation for this item, so item 1 goes to Agent 2.
6. Lastly, item 5 is valued highest by Agent 1 at 35, so item 5 is allocated to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.
