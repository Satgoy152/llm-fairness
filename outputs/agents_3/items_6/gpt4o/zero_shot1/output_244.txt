Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  62  11  84  74  20
1  21  92   4  24  14  59
2  38  29  50  71  46  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a simple approach to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their individual valuations. Let's try to distribute the items so that each agent feels satisfied with the items they receive.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items 0 and 3 have the highest values for Agent 0 (65 and 84, respectively). Let's assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items 1 and 5 are highly valued by Agent 1 (92 and 59, respectively). Assign these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items 2 and 4 have relatively higher values according to Agent 2's preference (50 and 46, respectively). Assign these items to Agent 2.

By following this allocation strategy, we ensure each agent gets items they value more highly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
