Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  56  31  30  71  37
1  92  90  89  84  90  62
2  76   8   2  18  14  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation that achieves a balanced distribution based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 0 and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high values across most items, but particularly high for items 0 and 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 0, but generally lower values compared to the other agents.

Let's consider an allocation strategy that can balance the allocations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 92).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 90).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 31).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 30).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 71).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 50).

This allocation is based on the highest valuations each agent has for certain items and ensures that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with Agent 0 receiving three items, Agent 1 receiving two items, and Agent 2 receiving one item.
