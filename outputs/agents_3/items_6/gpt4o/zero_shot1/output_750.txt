Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  99  78  58  50  81
1  10  62  10  24  19  50
2   5  17  59  38  40  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by comparing the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly six. Let's try to distribute the items by looking at their valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (99), 5 (81), and 2 (78).
2. **Agent 1** has moderate valuations for items 1 (62) and 5 (50).
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (90), and moderate valuations for items 2 (59) and 4 (40).

By analyzing these valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 2 (valuations 99 and 78).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 3 and 4 (valuations 24 and 19).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 5 (valuations 5 and 90).

Let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
