Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  85   9  10  87  33
1  85  38  17  28  75  32
2  77  85  52  95  25  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively balanced valuations, but item 0 and 4 stand out.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.

Let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they highly value it (89).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it highly (85) and Agent 0 can still get good value from other items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (87).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the most (95).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the best remaining option for them (17).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is the remaining item and they have a decent valuation (32).

Based on this allocation, here is the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
