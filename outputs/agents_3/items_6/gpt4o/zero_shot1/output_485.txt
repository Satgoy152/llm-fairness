Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93   7  28  30  77  96
1   4  59  84  55  98  17
2  80  90  67  88  17   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93  7 28 30 77 96]
 [ 4 59 84 55 98 17]
 [80 90 67 88 17  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [93, 7, 28, 30, 77, 96]
- Agent 1's valuations: [4, 59, 84, 55, 98, 17]
- Agent 2's valuations: [80, 90, 67, 88, 17, 6]

A balanced allocation can be achieved by assigning the items based on the highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0's Best Valuations:**
   - Item 5 (value: 96)
   - Item 0 (value: 93)

2. **Agent 1's Best Valuations:**
   - Item 4 (value: 98)
   - Item 2 (value: 84)

3. **Agent 2's Best Valuations:**
   - Item 3 (value: 88)
   - Item 1 (value: 90)

### Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4
- Agent 2 receives items: 1, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and the total value for each agent is optimized based on their preferences.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
