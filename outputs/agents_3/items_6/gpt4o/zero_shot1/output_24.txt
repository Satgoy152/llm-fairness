Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  31  83  41  62  72
1  97  46  15  53  81  50
2  45  53  68  94  75  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 46 15 53 81 50]
 [45 53 68 94 75 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction by distributing the items in a way where each agent's total valuation is maximized. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items 1 and 2 have high values for Agent 0 (31 and 83, respectively).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items 0 and 4 have high values for Agent 1 (97 and 81, respectively).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items 3 and 5 have high values for Agent 2 (94 and 83, respectively).

This allocation tries to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 5.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
