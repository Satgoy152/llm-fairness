Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  68  94  87   8  59
1  10  80  16  26  17  38
2  46  30  95  62  91  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. We can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with highest valuations: 2 (94), 3 (87)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item with highest valuation: 1 (80)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with highest valuations: 4 (91), 0 (46), 5 (20)

Let's verify that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3]
- Agent 1 receives item [1]
- Agent 2 receives items [0, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. The allocation also respects the preferences of the agents to the extent possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
