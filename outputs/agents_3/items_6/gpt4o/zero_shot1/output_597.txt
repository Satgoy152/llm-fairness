Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90   1  76  73  75  61
1  18  48  93  34  48  57
2  54  34   5  11  95  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 48 93 34 48 57]
 [54 34  5 11 95 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is 6. One common approach is to use the "Maximum Weight Matching" method or a similar strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's look at the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90   1  76  73  75  61
1  18  48  93  34  48  57
2  54  34   5  11  95  95
```

We will allocate items to maximize the agents' satisfaction:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because it has the highest value (90).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because it has the highest value (93).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because it has the highest value (95).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 2 because it also has a high value (95).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because it has a relatively high value (73).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 1 because it has a better value for them compared to other unallocated items.

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 5.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
