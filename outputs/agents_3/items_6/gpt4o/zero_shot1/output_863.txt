Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  87  14  85  98  15
1  85  84  51  29  71  78
2  60  50  33  61  87  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 50 33 61 87 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should attempt to maximize the satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a similar number of items. We have 3 agents and 6 items, so ideally, each agent should receive 2 items.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98) and Item 0 (89).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (85) and Item 5 (78).

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (87) and Item 5 (82).

To ensure a fair distribution, let's allocate the items based on the highest preference while considering other agents' preferences and the need for each agent to receive two items.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 because it is their highest preference, and it is also highly valued by Agent 2.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 as it is their highest preference, and it is also highly valued by Agent 0.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 as it is their second-highest preference, and it is also highly valued by Agent 1.
- Now, for the remaining items, evaluate the second-highest preferences:
  - Agent 0's second-highest remaining is Item 1 (87), assign it to Agent 0.
  - Agent 1's second-highest remaining is Item 2 (51), assign it to Agent 1.
  - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 as it is left.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
