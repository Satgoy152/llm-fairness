Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   3  86  55   1  49
1  46   0   8   2  63   6
2  56  45  18  50  40  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 45 18 50 40 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [98, 3, 86, 55, 1, 49]
   - Agent 1: [46, 0, 8, 2, 63, 6]
   - Agent 2: [56, 45, 18, 50, 40, 94]

2. **Assign Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (98) and item 2 (86).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (63).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 5 (94) and item 3 (50).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 1.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2, who values it at 45, the highest remaining valuation for this item.

4. **Ensure Each Agent Gets an Item:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives item 4.
   - Agent 2 receives items 3, 5, and 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and the distribution maximizes the valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5, 1]
}
```
