Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  68  10  16  54  26
1  59  74  73  74  57  30
2  39  54  81  31  51  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 68 10 16 54 26]
 [59 74 73 74 57 30]
 [39 54 81 31 51 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their satisfaction. First, let's evaluate the valuations:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [95, 68, 10, 16, 54, 26]
- **Agent 1**: [59, 74, 73, 74, 57, 30]
- **Agent 2**: [39, 54, 81, 31, 51, 56]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Each agent should receive at least one item, if possible.
2. Assign items to maximize the total value for each agent.

We will consider one item at a time and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

### Allocation Process:
- **Item 0**:
  - Agent 0 values it highest at 95.
  - Allocate to Agent 0.

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 1 values it highest at 74.
  - Allocate to Agent 1.

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 2 values it highest at 81.
  - Allocate to Agent 2.

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 1 values it highest at 74.
  - Allocate to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 54, and Agent 1 values it less at 57. However, Agent 1 already has two items.
  - Allocate to Agent 0.

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 2 values it highest at 56.
  - Allocate to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all items fairly among the three agents.
