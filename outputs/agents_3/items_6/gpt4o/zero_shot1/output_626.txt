Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  28  76  39  69   4
1   7   5  14  46   9  18
2  13  96   0  22  92   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7  5 14 46  9 18]
 [13 96  0 22 92  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. One way to approach this is to use a method that ensures each agent receives items for which they have relatively higher valuations compared to the other agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [89, 28, 76, 39, 69, 4]
Agent 1: [7, 5, 14, 46, 9, 18]
Agent 2: [13, 96, 0, 22, 92, 8]
```

A possible way to allocate these items fairly might involve considering the highest value each agent places on an item that is not highly valued by others, or by distributing items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 89, highest among all for item 0)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 96, highest among all for item 1)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 76, highest among all for item 2)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 46, highest among all for item 3)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 92, highest among all for item 4)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 18, highest among all for item 5)

With this allocation, each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-value items, and all items are distributed. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
