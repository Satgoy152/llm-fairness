Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39   6  22  61  67   8
1  29  51  71  63  18  66
2  66  86  64  94  38  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 51 71 63 18 66]
 [66 86 64 94 38 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to do so:

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation for any single item, with item 3 valued at 94.

2. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 4 at 67, which is the highest among all agent-item pairs for item 4.

3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 has a high valuation of 86 for item 1.

4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 71.

5. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 5 at 66, which is the highest among all agent-item pairs for item 5.

6. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 at 39, which is the highest among all agent-item pairs for item 0.

Based on this assignment strategy, the allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their values for the items.
