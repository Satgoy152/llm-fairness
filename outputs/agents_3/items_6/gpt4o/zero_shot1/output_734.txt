Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  19  15  65   6   9
1  54  43  97  30  15  23
2  74  38  42   4  49  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive. A simple approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible.

Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0: 23
   - Agent 1: 54
   - Agent 2: 74
   - Best valuation: Agent 2 (74)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 19
   - Agent 1: 43
   - Agent 2: 38
   - Best valuation: Agent 1 (43)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 15
   - Agent 1: 97
   - Agent 2: 42
   - Best valuation: Agent 1 (97)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 65
   - Agent 1: 30
   - Agent 2: 4
   - Best valuation: Agent 0 (65)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 6
   - Agent 1: 15
   - Agent 2: 49
   - Best valuation: Agent 2 (49)

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0: 9
   - Agent 1: 23
   - Agent 2: 47
   - Best valuation: Agent 2 (47)

Now let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item. Agent 0 currently has one item, Agent 1 has two, and Agent 2 has three. This allocation is balanced in terms of the number of items relative to their valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
