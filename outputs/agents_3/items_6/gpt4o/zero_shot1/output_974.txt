Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  72  73  46  22  75
1  34  74  44  50  90  74
2  17  48  36  60  87  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 74 44 50 90 74]
 [17 48 36 60 87 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Allocation for Agent 0:**
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 with a value of 75.
   - The next highest value is item 2 with a value of 73.
   - Select items 5 and 2 for Agent 0.

2. **Allocation for Agent 1:**
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 90.
   - The next highest value is item 1 with a value of 74.
   - Select items 4 and 1 for Agent 1.

3. **Allocation for Agent 2:**
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 with a value of 87 (already taken).
   - The next highest value is item 3 with a value of 60.
   - The next highest available item is item 0 with a value of 17.
   - Select items 3 and 0 for Agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and all items are distributed among the agents.
