Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  41  26   0   9  74
1  88  49  76  37  44  40
2  13  58  47  94  79  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 49 76 37 44 40]
 [13 58 47 94 79 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one common approach is to use a method known as the "maximum envy-free" allocation, where we try to allocate items in such a way that minimizes envy among agents. Another approach could be using the "maximum sum" allocation, where we aim to maximize the total valuation of the items allocated to each agent. For simplicity, we can attempt an allocation that tries to balance fairness and maximizes value.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  41  26   0   9  74
1  88  49  76  37  44  40
2  13  58  47  94  79  37
```

Let's attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0 should get items with high valuation to them: Item 5 (74) and Item 0 (72)
- Agent 1 should get items with high valuation to them: Item 2 (76) and Item 0 (88)
- Agent 2 should get items with high valuation to them: Item 3 (94) and Item 4 (79)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and we attempt to maximize their valuations. However, this assignment exceeds the total number of items available. So, we need to adjust:

A possible fair allocation is:
- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the items available and respects the constraint of allocating exactly 6 items.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
