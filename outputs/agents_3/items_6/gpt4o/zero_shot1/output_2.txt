Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  63  31   9  28  70
1  93  29  35  64  67  65
2  40  44  92  78  85  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 29 35 64 67 65]
 [40 44 92 78 85 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations and aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one way to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows: [64, 63, 31, 9, 28, 70]
2. **Agent 1** values items as follows: [93, 29, 35, 64, 67, 65]
3. **Agent 2** values items as follows: [40, 44, 92, 78, 85, 79]

We will attempt to allocate items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is maximized and each agent gets at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy
- **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly and not as highly valued by others.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 has a high valuation for and are less valued by others.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items with high valuations for Agent 2, ensuring balanced distribution.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Items 5 (70) and 1 (63)
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 (93) and 3 (64)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 (92) and 4 (85)

These allocations aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated fairly. 

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
