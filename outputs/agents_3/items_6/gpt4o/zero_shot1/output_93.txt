Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  10  62  58  72  85
1  56  26  23  21  69  92
2  74  28  98  30  19   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 10 62 58 72 85]
 [56 26 23 21 69 92]
 [74 28 98 30 19  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent and assign those items first, if possible.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if it can be done without losing fairness.
3. Allocate remaining items to maximize the individual agent's total valuation without exceeding the total number of items.

Given the valuation table:

Agent 0's highest-valued item is item 5 (value 85).
Agent 1's highest-valued item is item 5 (value 92).
Agent 2's highest-valued item is item 2 (value 98).

Assign items considering a balance in the number of items:

1. Agent 2 gets item 2 (highest value for them).
2. Agent 1 gets item 5 (highest value for them).
3. Agent 0 has item 0 as a significant value (81) and gets item 0.

Now distribute remaining items:

- Items remaining: 1, 3, 4
- Current allocations:
  - Agent 0: [0]
  - Agent 1: [5]
  - Agent 2: [2]

Distribute remaining items based on maximizing valuation:

1. Agent 0 should receive item 4 (value 72) as it has a higher value for them compared to other agents.
2. Agent 1 should receive item 3 (value 21) as it maximizes their allocation without exceeding others.
3. Agent 2 should receive item 1 (value 28) as it has a better valuation for them than others.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [5, 3]
- Agent 2: [2, 1]

Here is the final JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
