Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  81   0  59  30  75
1  63   0  52  17  64  29
2  81  88  95  83  38  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 81  0 59 30 75]
 [63  0 52 17 64 29]
 [81 88 95 83 38 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [70, 81, 0, 59, 30, 75]
Agent 1: [63, 0, 52, 17, 64, 29]
Agent 2: [81, 88, 95, 83, 38, 30]
```

We will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest overall valuations, particularly high for items 2 and 1. We can allocate these items to Agent 2.
   
2. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 5. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4. We can allocate this item to Agent 1.

4. For the remaining item (item 3), Agent 2 has the highest valuation compared to other agents. We can allocate this item to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 3

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the allocations are fairly distributed based on the given valuations.
