Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  70  49  52  79  57
1  94  76  68  98   1   9
2  72  12  54  49  77  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation considers the agents' valuations as much as possible. A way to achieve this is by maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents with their allocated items. 

To do this, we could use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent and each agent ends up with at least one item.

Let's calculate the total valuations first:

- Agent 0: 82 + 70 + 49 + 52 + 79 + 57 = 389
- Agent 1: 94 + 76 + 68 + 98 + 1 + 9 = 346
- Agent 2: 72 + 12 + 54 + 49 + 77 + 27 = 291

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (highest valuation: 98).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (next highest: 94).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (next highest: 79).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (next highest: 70).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (next highest: 68).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (next highest: 27).

With this allocation, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation reflects high valuations for each agent. 

Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```
