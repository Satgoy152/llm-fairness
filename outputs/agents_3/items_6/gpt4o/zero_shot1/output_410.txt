Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  47  85  43  21  97
1  82  36   8  92  66  60
2  64  35   8  23  74  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 36  8 92 66 60]
 [64 35  8 23 74 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Below is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 97. Let's assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 92. Let's assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 74. Let's assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the second highest at 85. Let's assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the second highest at 82. Let's assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the next highest at 64, but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 1 at 35. Let's assign item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, respecting their highest valuations as much as possible.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
