Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  11  21  82  72  79
1  65  98  43  27  92  47
2  17  82   7  53  56  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 11 21 82 72 79]
 [65 98 43 27 92 47]
 [17 82  7 53 56 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated. Given that there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should receive 2 items.

Let's analyze the matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  11  21  82  72  79
1  65  98  43  27  92  47
2  17  82   7  53  56  75
```

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5. 
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 and 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 1 and 5.

An allocation strategy considering these high valuations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 82)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 79)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 98)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 92)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 17)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 7)

Now, let's list the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent and ensures all items are allocated.
