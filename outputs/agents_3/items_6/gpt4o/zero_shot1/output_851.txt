Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  35  52  84   5  35
1  36  75  39  28  90  75
2  60  85  94  51  96  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items they value highly. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (84)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (90)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (96), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest valuation: Item 2 (94)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have assigned three items. Let's continue assigning the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and trying to respect their preferences:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 3 and unallocated: Item 0 (54)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 4 and unallocated: Item 1 (75)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest valuation after Item 2 and unallocated: Item 5 (58)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

All items have now been allocated. Each agent has received two items, and the allocation attempts to respect the preferences based on valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value reasonably highly, given the constraints of the problem.
