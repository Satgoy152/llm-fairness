Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  29  14  66  16  81
1  87  50  87   2  69  86
2   5  94  68  87  82   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 50 87  2 69 86]
 [ 5 94 68 87 82  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Let's review the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: 37, 29, 14, 66, 16, 81
- Agent 1: 87, 50, 87, 2, 69, 86
- Agent 2: 5, 94, 68, 87, 82, 4

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an unallocated item. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by assigning items based on the highest available value for each agent:
   - Agent 0's highest value is 81 for item 5.
   - Agent 1's highest value is 87, and they have two such items: 0 and 2. Choose item 0.
   - Agent 2's highest value is 94 for item 1.

2. Allocate these items:
   - Agent 0 receives item 5.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0.
   - Agent 2 receives item 1.

3. Allocate the remaining items:
   - Items left are 2, 3, 4.

4. Choose the next highest available values for each agent:
   - Agent 0's next highest value is 66 for item 3.
   - Agent 1 still values item 2 at 87.
   - Agent 2's next highest is 87 for item 3, but item 3 is already taken by Agent 0, so item 4 is next with a value of 82.

5. Allocate these items:
   - Agent 0 receives item 3.
   - Agent 1 receives item 2.
   - Agent 2 receives item 4.

Now each agent has received 2 items, and all items have been allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while still allocating all items.
