Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82   5  74  31  74  80
1  89  91  55  70  86  67
2  16   1  79  83  99  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their preferences, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items. One approach is to use a method like the "maximum sum" allocation, where we aim to achieve the highest total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (82)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 5 (80)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (91)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (89), already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next highest valuation: Item 4 (86)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (99), already allocated to Agent 1
   - Next highest valuation: Item 3 (83)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 2 (79)

Now, let's make sure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Already has Item 0 and Item 5.
- **Agent 1**: Already has Item 1 and Item 4.
- **Agent 2**: Has Item 3 and Item 2.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items and attempts to respect the agents' valuations as much as possible.
