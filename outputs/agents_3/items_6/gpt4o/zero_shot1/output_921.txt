Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  79   5  31  38  91
1  94  39  43  17  22  17
2  34  72  28  78   0  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 79  5 31 38 91]
 [94 39 43 17 22 17]
 [34 72 28 78  0 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate the items in a way that is both fair and maximizes the overall valuation for each agent.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Items with values 62, 79, 5, 31, 38, 91
   - Agent 1: Items with values 94, 39, 43, 17, 22, 17
   - Agent 2: Items with values 34, 72, 28, 78, 0, 11

2. **Select items based on highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 91)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 94)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 78)

3. **Allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 79)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 43)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (value 0) [This item has no other high valuation, thus can go to Agent 2]

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has items [1, 5]
   - Agent 1 has items [0, 2]
   - Agent 2 has items [3, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest possible valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
