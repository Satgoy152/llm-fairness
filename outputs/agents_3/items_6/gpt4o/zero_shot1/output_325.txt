Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  36  59   0  50  70
1  67  86  42  88  93  55
2  74  73  25  81   8  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value received by all agents. We will aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, ensuring a balanced distribution of total value.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (70), Item 2 (59), Item 4 (50)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (93), Item 3 (88), Item 1 (86)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (85), Item 0 (74), Item 3 (81)

Let's try to distribute these items to maximize the total value:

- **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values it the highest (85).
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values it the highest (93).
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values it highly (88).
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values it highly (74).
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values it highly (59).
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 has the next highest value for this item after the others have received their top choices (36).

Now, we have allocated all items fairly based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
