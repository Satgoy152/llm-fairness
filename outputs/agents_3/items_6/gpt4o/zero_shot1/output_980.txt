Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  25  66  73  86  94
1  92  58  44  16   5  82
2  28  11  28  29  63  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [90, 25, 66, 73, 86, 94]
   - Agent 1: [92, 58, 44, 16, 5, 82]
   - Agent 2: [28, 11, 28, 29, 63, 90]

2. **Identify Potential Allocations**: 
   - Look for high valuations for each agent to ensure they are satisfied with their allocation.

3. **Assign Items**:
   - Start with the highest valued item for each agent, then proceed to allocate the remaining items ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

4. **Consider Constraints**:
   - Ensure all 6 items are allocated.
   - Each agent can receive any number of items, including zero.

5. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, and 5.
   - Agent 1 has high values for items 0 and 5, but item 5 is already valued highly by Agent 0, so consider allocating item 3 which is relatively high compared to other low values.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly.

Using these considerations, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives an appropriate number of items with respect to their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
