Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  45  55  34   0  33
1  88  56  40  17  61  64
2  69  10  85  58  82  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for the agents. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Assign the items by finding the highest valuation for each item across all agents, ensuring no agent receives more than 2 items (since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each should get 2 items).

2. Use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an approximately fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (88).
- Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (56).
- Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (85).
- Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (58).
- Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (82).
- Item 5 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (64).

Assigning based on these valuations while ensuring fairness:

1. Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, since they have high valuations for these items.
2. Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4, which they value highly.
3. Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5, since these maximize their remaining possible value.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
