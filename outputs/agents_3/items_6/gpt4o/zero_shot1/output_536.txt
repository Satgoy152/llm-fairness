Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  39  80  58  34  31
1  57  19  68   7  38  60
2  70   1  87   7  98  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that reflects the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. There are several methods to achieve this, such as maximizing total valuation or ensuring envy-freeness. Here, I'll focus on maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: [34, 39, 80, 58, 34, 31]
- Agent 1: [57, 19, 68, 7, 38, 60]
- Agent 2: [70, 1, 87, 7, 98, 22]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (70).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (39).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (87).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (58).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (98).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (60).

This allocation maximizes the total valuation and ensures that each agent receives at least one item. Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
