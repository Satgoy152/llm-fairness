Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  81  95  99  35  24
1  79  58  56  72  92  61
2  94  38  22  93  63  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 81 95 99 35 24]
 [79 58 56 72 92 61]
 [94 38 22 93 63 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items (0, 1, 2, 3).
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items (0, 3).

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 3. This gives them values of 95 and 99, totaling 194.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 4 and 5. This gives them values of 92 and 61, totaling 153.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 1. This gives them values of 94 and 38, totaling 132.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least two items, and all 6 items are allocated. The sum of valuations is maximized for each agent as best as possible under these constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
