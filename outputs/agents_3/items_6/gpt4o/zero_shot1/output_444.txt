Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  56  15  72  33  21
1  82   8  84  40  75  74
2  98  71  18  38  75  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82  8 84 40 75 74]
 [98 71 18 38 75 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each item by each agent.
2. Allocate items starting with the highest valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 72
  - Item 4: 33
  - Item 5: 21

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 40
  - Item 4: 75
  - Item 5: 74

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 18
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 75
  - Item 5: 16

Now, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (72). Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (84). Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (98). Allocate item 0.

Now, considering the remaining items (1, 4, 5):

- **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is for item 1 (56).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is for item 4 (75).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest valuation is for item 1 (71), but already taken by Agent 0. So, next is item 4 (75), but already taken by Agent 1. Next is item 5 (16).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 5

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and it attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
