Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  38  31   4  15  79
1  87  83  41   0  11   3
2   5  28  73  68  65  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 38 31  4 15 79]
 [87 83 41  0 11  3]
 [ 5 28 73 68 65 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 values the items as follows: [49, 38, 31, 4, 15, 79]
2. Agent 1 values the items as follows: [87, 83, 41, 0, 11, 3]
3. Agent 2 values the items as follows: [5, 28, 73, 68, 65, 31]

Considering the valuations, we can try to maximize happiness by allocating the items based on each agent's strongest preferences while ensuring the total distribution of items is fair. Here's a possible allocation:

- Give Agent 0 the items with the highest value to them, which are items 5 and 0.
- Give Agent 1 the items with the highest value to them, which are items 1 and 2.
- Give Agent 2 the items with the highest value to them, which are items 3 and 4.

This way, each agent gets two items, and the distribution is balanced. Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
