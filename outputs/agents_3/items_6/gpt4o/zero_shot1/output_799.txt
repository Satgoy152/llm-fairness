Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  87  38  10  80  84
1  18  34  32   8  81  40
2   9  41  53  60  27  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their total valuations, we can use a strategy that involves assigning items based on the highest preference of each agent, ensuring that each gets at least one item if possible.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each agent the item they value the most, if it hasn't been assigned yet.
   
2. **Handling Conflicts:**
   - If multiple agents value the same item the highest, assign the item to the agent who values it the most, then proceed to assign the next preferred item to the other agent.
   
3. **Ensuring Fair Distribution:**
   - Ensure that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (87).
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (81).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (60).

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 1
- Agent 1 gets item 4
- Agent 2 gets item 3

Available items left: 0, 2, 5

We then look at the next highest preferences based on remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 5 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 5 (40), but Agent 0 values it higher.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 5 (41).

Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Available items left: 0, 2

Continue with remaining items:
- **Agent 0**: Next is item 2 (38).
- **Agent 1**: Next is item 2 (32).
- **Agent 2**: Next is item 2 (53).

Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest remaining valuation).

Available items left: 0

For the last item:
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (1)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (18)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (9)

Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences and ensures all items are distributed.
