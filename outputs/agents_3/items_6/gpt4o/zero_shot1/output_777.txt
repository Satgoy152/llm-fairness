Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  54  65  32  71  91
1   8  82  86  28  30  34
2   6  40  26  42  12   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 82 86 28 30 34]
 [ 6 40 26 42 12  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can try to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of items based on their valuations. This involves considering both the number of items and the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's assess the total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0: 25 + 54 + 65 + 32 + 71 + 91 = 338
- Agent 1: 8 + 82 + 86 + 28 + 30 + 34 = 268
- Agent 2: 6 + 40 + 26 + 42 + 12 + 8 = 134

Now, let's try to allocate the items considering their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (91), Item 4 (71), Item 2 (65)
   - Allocate: Item 5, Item 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (86), Item 1 (82)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (42), Item 1 (40)
   - Allocate: Item 3, Item 0

Since item 1 has already been allocated to Agent 1, we can adjust the allocations:

Let's revise and finalize the allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 5, Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 2, Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 3, Item 0

Now, let's represent the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with two items, taking into account their highest valuations and ensuring a fair distribution.
