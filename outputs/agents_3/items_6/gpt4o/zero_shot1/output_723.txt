Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  75  65   1   0  44
1  64  37  49  66  59  72
2  19   4  46  18   8  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 37 49 66 59 72]
 [19  4 46 18  8 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

**Step 1: Identify High Valuation Matches**
- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 has moderate valuations for items 2 and 5.

**Step 2: Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations**
- Give items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0. This will maximize their satisfaction as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Give items 3 and 4 to Agent 1. These items have relatively high valuations for Agent 1.
- Give item 5 to Agent 2. This item has the highest valuation for Agent 2.

**Step 3: Verify the Allocation**
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation given the constraints.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
