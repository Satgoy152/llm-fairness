Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  70  99  30  59  28
1  99  31   8  71  47  54
2  83  55  37   1  70  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are 6 items and 3 agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if feasible, and maintain fairness.

Let's analyze the given valuations to determine the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (70).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (71).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (70).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (54).

Now, let's ensure at least one item per agent:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, item 1 to Agent 0, and item 4 to Agent 2 (ensuring at least one item per agent).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, item 3 to Agent 1, and item 5 to Agent 2 (based on highest remaining value).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the overall allocation is based on the highest values for the respective items.
