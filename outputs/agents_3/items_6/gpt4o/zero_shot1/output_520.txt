Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  79  19  23   8  46
1  99  21   7  83  97  19
2  50  84  37  10  93  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 84 37 10 93 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is balanced as much as possible, or prioritize giving each agent their highest valued items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [19, 79, 19, 23, 8, 46]
- Agent 1 values: [99, 21, 7, 83, 97, 19]
- Agent 2 values: [50, 84, 37, 10, 93, 23]

A fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it's their highest value.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since it's their highest value.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since it's their highest value.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it is the next highest remaining value for Agent 1.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it significantly.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 to balance the allocation.

The allocations will be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 2]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
