Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  32   7  52   2  33
1  35  68  26  14  73  71
2   8  11  58  53  48  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will try to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their highest valued items, ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value is for item 0: 77
   - Second highest is item 3: 52
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value is for item 4: 73
   - Second highest is item 5: 71
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value is for item 2: 58
   - Second highest is item 3: 53
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Remaining items:** 1, 3, 5

4. **Agent 0:** 
   - After item 0, next highest available item is 1: 32
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1:**
   - After item 4, next highest available item is 5: 71
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, which is their second highest value.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the items they value highly.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
