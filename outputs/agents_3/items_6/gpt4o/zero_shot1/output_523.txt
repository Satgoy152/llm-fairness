Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  28  48  50  20  93
1  46  71  28  68  26  14
2  85  90  31  37  53  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for the items and distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, while trying to maximize the total satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [58, 28, 48, 50, 20, 93]
- Agent 1 values: [46, 71, 28, 68, 26, 14]
- Agent 2 values: [85, 90, 31, 37, 53, 74]

A fair allocation strategy might involve trying to maximize the sum of the values for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value (93) for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value (71) for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2. This item has the highest value (85) for Agent 2.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2. This item has the second highest value (53) for Agent 2, and Agent 2 still needs more items.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. This item has the second highest value (68) for Agent 1.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This item has the second highest value (48) for Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 5 with values [48, 93]
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 3 with values [71, 68]
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 4 with values [85, 53]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
