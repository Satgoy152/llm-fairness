Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77   7  44  46  79  99
1   4  67   5  50  88  26
2  37  53  91  75  53  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 67  5 50 88 26]
 [37 53 91 75 53 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's look at the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [77, 7, 44, 46, 79, 99]
- Agent 1 values: [4, 67, 5, 50, 88, 26]
- Agent 2 values: [37, 53, 91, 75, 53, 90]

We can aim to allocate items such that each agent gets a high-value item according to their preferences, while ensuring that the total distribution of all items is fair.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 4 (79)
   - Allocate: Item 5

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (88), Item 1 (67)
   - Allocate: Item 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (91), Item 5 (90)
   - Allocate: Item 2

Now, the unallocated items are 0, 1, and 3. Let's allocate these based on the next highest value preferences:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest values: Item 0 (77), Item 3 (46)
   - Allocate: Item 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (50)
   - Allocate: Item 3

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining item: Item 1 (53)
   - Allocate: Item 1

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, trying to maximize their valuations based on their preferences.
