Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33   5  77  31  67  62
1  51   0  19  36  45  70
2  34  87  36  91  97  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while keeping the distribution balanced. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has a strong valuation for item 2.
2. Agent 1 has a strong valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has strong valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.

Given that each agent should receive approximately two items (since there are three agents and six items), we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while also distributing the items evenly.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total number of items allocated is six.
