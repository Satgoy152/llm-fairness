Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  70  65  86  40  99
1  95  61  74  14   6  87
2  79  19  38  18  58  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll try to distribute the items such that the total value gained by each agent is as balanced as possible, while also considering the maximum possible value they can receive.

Let's analyze the given valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Values are [58, 70, 65, 86, 40, 99]
- Agent 1: Values are [95, 61, 74, 14, 6, 87]
- Agent 2: Values are [79, 19, 38, 18, 58, 73]

Based on these valuations, we can aim to allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign items to maximize the value for each agent, ensuring that all items are allocated.
2. Balance the total value received by each agent as evenly as possible.

Following this approach, here is one potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2
- Agent 2 receives items: 1, 4

This allocation takes into account high-value items for each agent and tries to balance the overall distribution.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
