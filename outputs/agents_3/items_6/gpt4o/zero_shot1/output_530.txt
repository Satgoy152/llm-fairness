Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  18   8  88  87   6
1  72  83  28  32  85  75
2  72  22  44  84  88   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 83 28 32 85 75]
 [72 22 44 84 88  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. We can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 64), item 4 to agent 2 (value 88), and item 1 to agent 1 (value 83) since these are their highest valuations.
2. Next, assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 84), as agent 2 values it highly.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 28) because it's one of the remaining highest valuations for agent 1.
4. Finally, assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 6).

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
