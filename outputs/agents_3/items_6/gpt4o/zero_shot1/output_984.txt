Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   0  69  57  95  48
1  42  30  80  13  16  94
2  54  17  57  81  50  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

First, let's assess the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0: [20, 0, 69, 57, 95, 48]
- Agent 1: [42, 30, 80, 13, 16, 94]
- Agent 2: [54, 17, 57, 81, 50, 17]

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize the total valuations for each agent.

A possible allocation could be as follows:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it's the highest valuation for Agent 0 (95).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it's the highest valuation for Agent 1 (94).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it's the highest valuation for Agent 2 (81).

After assigning these three items based on the highest valuations, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 1, and 2.

Considering the remaining items:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0: 20
  - Agent 1: 42
  - Agent 2: 54 (highest)

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 0
  - Agent 1: 30 (highest)
  - Agent 2: 17

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 69 (highest)
  - Agent 1: 80
  - Agent 2: 57

Based on these values, we can assign:

- Item 0 to Agent 2
- Item 1 to Agent 1
- Item 2 to Agent 0

Now, let's put this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent.
