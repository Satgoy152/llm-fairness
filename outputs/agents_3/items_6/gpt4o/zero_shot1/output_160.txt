Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  77   0  87  95  37
1  27  99  91  93  79  19
2  31  57   4  97  45  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 99 91 93 79 19]
 [31 57  4 97 45 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by allocating items based on their highest valuations. The goal is to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while considering their preferences.

Let's evaluate the highest valuations for each item and assign them to the respective agents:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 90
  - Agent 1 values it at 27
  - Agent 2 values it at 31
  - **Assign to Agent 0**

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 77
  - Agent 1 values it at 99
  - Agent 2 values it at 57
  - **Assign to Agent 1**

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 0
  - Agent 1 values it at 91
  - Agent 2 values it at 4
  - **Assign to Agent 1**

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 87
  - Agent 1 values it at 93
  - Agent 2 values it at 97
  - **Assign to Agent 2**

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 95
  - Agent 1 values it at 79
  - Agent 2 values it at 45
  - **Assign to Agent 0**

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 37
  - Agent 1 values it at 19
  - Agent 2 values it at 22
  - **Assign to Agent 0**

Now let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 4, and 5, Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, and Agent 2 receives item 3. This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
