Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  19  40  17  81  67
1  48  30   2  27  60  29
2  81  91  90  46  31   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 91 90 46 31  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can approach the problem by considering each agent's highest valued items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's how the items can be allocated based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (value 81)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (value 67)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value 48)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (value 60) but already taken by Agent 0, so next available is Item 3 (value 27)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (value 91)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (value 90)

Now, let's assign the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0** gets items [4, 5]
- **Agent 1** gets items [0, 3]
- **Agent 2** gets items [1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences, and all items are distributed.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
