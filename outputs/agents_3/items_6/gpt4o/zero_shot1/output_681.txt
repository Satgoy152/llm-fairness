Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53   7  19  50  15  99
1  70  38   3   5   2  65
2  10   7  50  13  37  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10  7 50 13 37 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to distribute the items considering each agent's values and trying to balance overall satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 5 has the highest value (99) for Agent 0.
   - Item 3 has the second-highest value (50) for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0 has the highest value (70) for Agent 1.
   - Item 1 has the second-highest value (38) for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2 has the highest value (50) for Agent 2.
   - Item 4 has the third-highest value (37) for Agent 2, which is reasonable given the remaining items and their values for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that they value relatively highly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
