Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  99  79  33  25  50
1  44  78  98  57  89   6
2  73  52  31  87  87  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to allocate items based on the preferences and valuations that each agent has for these items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations and consider possible allocations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 2 (79), Item 0 (38)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 2 (98), Item 4 (89), Item 3 (57)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 4 (87), Item 0 (73)

Let's try to distribute the items based on maximizing these high valuations:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (99).
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the highest (98).
3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2**: Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 value it highly, but Agent 2 has a slightly higher preference for this item (87).
4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item highly (73).
5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item highly (89).
6. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0**: This is the remaining item, and Agent 0 values it (50).

Given these allocations, the distribution looks balanced in terms of maximizing each agent's high-value items while also ensuring each agent gets some items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
