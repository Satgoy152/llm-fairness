Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  69  28   5  31  10
1  32  52  16  32  75   9
2  62  84  10  36  60  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 52 16 32 75  9]
 [62 84 10 36 60 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, as there are 3 agents and 6 items.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [17, 69, 28, 5, 31, 10]
   - Best allocation based on value: Items 1 and 4 (Values: 69 and 31)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [32, 52, 16, 32, 75, 9]
   - Best allocation based on value: Items 4 and 1 (Values: 75 and 52)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [62, 84, 10, 36, 60, 62]
   - Best allocation based on value: Items 1 and 2 (Values: 84 and 62)

Now, let's look at how we can allocate these items to avoid conflicts and ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- **Allocate to Agent 0:**
  - Item 1 (Value: 69)
  - Item 3 (Value: 5) - next highest value after item 1

- **Allocate to Agent 1:**
  - Item 4 (Value: 75)
  - Item 0 (Value: 32)

- **Allocate to Agent 2:**
  - Item 2 (Value: 10)
  - Item 5 (Value: 62)

This ensures each agent receives items and makes use of all 6 items available.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
