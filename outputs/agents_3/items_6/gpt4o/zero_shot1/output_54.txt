Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  64  80  56  10  67
1  65  69  39  15   9  48
2  41   7   0  71  44  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 64 80 56 10 67]
 [65 69 39 15  9 48]
 [41  7  0 71 44 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets at least one item while also maximizing the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [78, 64, 80, 56, 10, 67]
Agent 1: [65, 69, 39, 15, 9, 48]
Agent 2: [41, 7, 0, 71, 44, 43]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Let's give Agent 0 item 2, which has the highest valuation for them.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 1 and 0. After Agent 0 takes item 2, Agent 1 should get item 1, which is the next highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 4, and 5):

4. Agent 0 should also get item 0 since it has their second-highest valuation.
5. Agent 1's next best option is item 5.
6. Agent 2 should get item 4, which is their next best available option.

Thus, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.
