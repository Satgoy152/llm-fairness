Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  86  77  91  21  38
1  65  87  16  48  76   0
2  58  57  70  44   1  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 87 16 48 76  0]
 [58 57 70 44  1 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 12, 86, 77, 91, 21, 38
- Agent 1: 65, 87, 16, 48, 76, 0
- Agent 2: 58, 57, 70, 44, 1, 27

We'll assign items to each agent based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 4, 5):

4. Item 0:
   - Agent 1 values it at 65, which is the highest among agent 1 and agent 2 (Agent 0 already has an item with higher valuation).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 1 values it at 76, which is higher than others.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 38, which is the highest remaining.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 0, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
