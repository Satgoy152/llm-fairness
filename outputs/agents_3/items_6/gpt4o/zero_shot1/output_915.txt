Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  77  68  94  38  35
1  95  52  24  45  49  72
2  16  10  29  89  77   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 52 24 45 49 72]
 [16 10 29 89 77  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use different fairness criteria such as maximizing the total value for each agent or ensuring each agent receives an approximately equal number of items. Here, I'll strive to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuations:

1. Agent 0: [45, 77, 68, 94, 38, 35]
2. Agent 1: [95, 52, 24, 45, 49, 72]
3. Agent 2: [16, 10, 29, 89, 77, 4]

To ensure a fair allocation, we can prioritize items based on the highest value for each agent, while distributing them across agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (highest value for Agent 0 is 94), and item 1 (second highest value for Agent 0 is 77).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (highest value for Agent 1 is 95), and item 5 (second highest value for Agent 1 is 72).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (highest value for Agent 2 is 77), and item 2 (second highest value for Agent 2 is 29).

Each agent gets two items, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
