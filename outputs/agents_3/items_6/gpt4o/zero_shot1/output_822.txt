Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  33  69  84  14  54
1  98  66  72  83  69  72
2  11  93  64  22  10  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 93 64 22 10 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. One approach is the "Greedy Allocation" method, which sequentially assigns items to the agents based on their highest individual valuation for unallocated items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 69.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 84.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 69.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 66.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair amount of items based on their preferences as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
