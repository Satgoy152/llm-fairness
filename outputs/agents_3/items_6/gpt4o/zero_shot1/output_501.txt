Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  29  80  36  87  36
1  81  10  90  29  71  20
2  46  55  63  71  16  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives some items and that the allocation is based on maximizing individual agents' preferences for the items they receive. We will use a strategy to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Items 2 (value 80) and 5 (value 36) are allocated to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 116.

2. Agent 1:
   - Items 0 (value 81) and 4 (value 71) are allocated to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total value of 152.

3. Agent 2:
   - Items 1 (value 55) and 3 (value 71) are allocated to Agent 2. This gives Agent 2 a total value of 126.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution is fairly balanced in terms of the total value each agent receives.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
