Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86   2  33  22   2  48
1  98  70  47  31  96   3
2   7  46  26  10  90  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 70 47 31 96  3]
 [ 7 46 26 10 90 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate the items that maximize Agent 0's total valuation. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value of 86) and item 5 the second most (value of 48).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate the items that maximize Agent 1's total valuation, avoiding items already allocated to Agent 0. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value of 98), but since it's already allocated, we consider item 4 next (value of 96), then item 1 (value of 70).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate the remaining items to Agent 2. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value of 90), but since it's already allocated, the next best option is item 5 (value of 56), which is also allocated. Next, Agent 2 values item 1 (value of 46), then item 2 (value of 26).

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0, Item 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 1, Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 2, Item 3

Total allocations:
- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
