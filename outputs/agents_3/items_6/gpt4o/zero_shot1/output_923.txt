Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  79  66  77  12  74
1  84  78   8  87   5  87
2  81   6  52   0  57  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 3 agents and 6 items, we can allocate 2 items to each agent. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each item across all agents to determine which items are most valued.
2. Allocate items to agents such that each agent gets items they highly value, while ensuring fairness.

Here is a potential allocation based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 3 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 1 and 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 4 highly.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 4.

The allocations in the specified JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and all 6 items are distributed among the agents.
