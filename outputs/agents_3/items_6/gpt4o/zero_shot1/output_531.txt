Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  11  19  94  45  36
1  64  69  45  84  91  28
2   5  69  46  85  62  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 5 69 46 85 62 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the overall satisfaction by allocating items based on their valuations. Here's one method to do this:

1. List all possible agent-item pairs along with their valuations.
2. Sort these pairs in descending order of valuations.
3. Assign items to agents starting from the highest valuation, ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent, and that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values the items: 0 (62), 1 (11), 2 (19), 3 (94), 4 (45), 5 (36)
- Agent 1 values the items: 0 (64), 1 (69), 2 (45), 3 (84), 4 (91), 5 (28)
- Agent 2 values the items: 0 (5), 1 (69), 2 (46), 3 (85), 4 (62), 5 (31)

Let's sort these valuations and allocate items:

1. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
2. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
3. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 69 (Agent 2 also values it at 69, but we'll give it to Agent 1 since they have fewer items so far).
4. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 64.
5. Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 46.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 36.

Given these allocations, here's the resulting distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 1, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
