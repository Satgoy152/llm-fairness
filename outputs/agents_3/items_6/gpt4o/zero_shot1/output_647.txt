Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  79  46  14   4  53
1  87   9  25  32  29  99
2  91   2  12  49  82  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This is a form of the "fair division" problem. Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: Value 79
   - Item 5: Value 53
   - Total Value: 132

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: Value 87
   - Item 2: Value 25
   - Total Value: 112

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3: Value 49
   - Item 4: Value 82
   - Total Value: 131

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value as much as possible, and all items are distributed. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, with all items allocated and each agent receiving at least one item.
