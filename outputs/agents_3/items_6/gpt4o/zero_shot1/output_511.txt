Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  95  61  15  52  40
1  33  86  97  93  22  95
2  64   6  25   3  83  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 86 97 93 22 95]
 [64  6 25  3 83 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally get 2 items. We'll aim to allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's look at the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: [77, 95, 61, 15, 52, 40]
- Agent 1: [33, 86, 97, 93, 22, 95]
- Agent 2: [64, 6, 25, 3, 83, 15]

We will assign items based on maximizing each agent's individual value:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (95) and Item 0 (77)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (97) and Item 3 (93)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (83) and Item 5 (15)

This allocation gives each agent 2 items, maximizing their individual values. Let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
