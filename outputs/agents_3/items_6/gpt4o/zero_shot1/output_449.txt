Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45   7  89   2  86  23
1  42  95  56  29  71  29
2  16  32  29   3  23  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 95 56 29 71 29]
 [16 32 29  3 23 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This allocation will attempt to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences expressed in the table. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 4, so we assign those to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1; we assign it to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so we assign it to Agent 2.
4. We need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 3). Agent 0 values item 0 the most, and Agent 1 values item 3 the most.

Now, the allocations can be presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their valuations and that items are distributed fairly among the agents.
