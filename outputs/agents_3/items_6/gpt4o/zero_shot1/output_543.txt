Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  91   9  35   5  62
1  34  35  60  12  54  34
2  54  34  55  51  50  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "max-min fairness" or "egalitarian" method, where we try to balance the allocations so that the least happy agent is as happy as possible.

Let's carefully distribute the items based on the values provided for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values for items are 91 (item 1) and 62 (item 5).
   - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values for items are 60 (item 2) and 54 (item 4).
   - Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values for items are 61 (item 5), but item 5 is already allocated. Next highest are 55 (item 2), 54 (item 0), and 51 (item 3).
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their given valuations, while each item is only allocated to one agent.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
