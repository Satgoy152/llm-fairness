Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40   0   4  37  80  78
1  89  48  43  16  12  96
2  68  33   7  80  52  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[40  0  4 37 80 78]
 [89 48 43 16 12 96]
 [68 33  7 80 52 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the valuations and the number of items each agent should receive. With 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items for a balanced distribution. Let's aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring everyone gets 2 items.

Valuations:

- Agent 0: [40, 0, 4, 37, 80, 78]
- Agent 1: [89, 48, 43, 16, 12, 96]
- Agent 2: [68, 33, 7, 80, 52, 50]

Let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Start by assigning the highest value item to each agent.
2. Then, assign the next highest value item to each agent such that it doesn't conflict with previous allocations.

**Allocation Process:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest value item: Item 4 (80)
  - Second highest value item: Item 5 (78)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest value item: Item 5 (96) [already allocated]
  - Next highest value item: Item 0 (89)
  - Next highest value item: Item 1 (48)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest value item: Item 3 (80)
  - Second highest value item: Item 0 (68) [already allocated]
  - Next highest value item: Item 5 (50) [already allocated]
  - Next highest value item: Item 4 (52) [already allocated]
  - Next highest value item: Item 2 (7)

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
