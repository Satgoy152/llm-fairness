Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  33  27  77  99  20
1  62  85  51  26  79  22
2  68  11  79  64  86  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 85 51 26 79 22]
 [68 11 79 64 86 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 4 (value 99) 
   - Item 3 (value 77)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 (value 85)
   - Item 0 (value 62)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2 (value 79)
   - Item 5 (value 33)

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a balanced distribution of total values among the agents. Each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated.
