Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  40  62  23  38  11
1   9  56  17  65  99  29
2  57  52  51  80  11  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the satisfaction or value each agent receives. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest value for each item.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair number of items (in this case, each agent should get 2 items since there are 6 items and 3 agents).

Let's assign items step by step:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 57.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 56.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 62.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 80.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 68.

Now let's adjust to ensure each agent gets exactly 2 items:

- Agent 2 has been allocated items 0, 3, and 5. We need to reallocate one item to maintain fairness.
- Transfer item 0 from Agent 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 also values it significantly (42).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 5

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
