Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  82   6  58  87  84
1  96   4  88  76  74  49
2  97  14  28  38  98  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 14 28 38 98 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's follow this approach:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Agent 2 values it at 97
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 14
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 76
   - Agent 2 values it at 38
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Agent 2 values it at 98
   - Allocate to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 78
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible. In this allocation:
- Agent 0 has items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 has items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 has items 0 and 4.

This allocation is fair as each agent is assigned two items, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
