Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  54  46  93  31  24
1  96  34  65  45  84  11
2  80  95  49  87  68  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 54 46 93 31 24]
 [96 34 65 45 84 11]
 [80 95 49 87 68 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We need to consider how each item is valued by each agent and distribute them accordingly. Here, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [71, 54, 46, 93, 31, 24]
- Agent 1: [96, 34, 65, 45, 84, 11]
- Agent 2: [80, 95, 49, 87, 68, 53]

One potential allocation strategy could be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's do this step by step:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (96).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (95).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (65).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (93).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (84).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (53).

Now, we check the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
