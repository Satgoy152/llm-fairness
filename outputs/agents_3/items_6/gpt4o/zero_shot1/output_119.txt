Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  93  37  62  32  47
1  19  49  60  22  64   9
2  40  59  68  41  25  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 49 60 22 64  9]
 [40 59 68 41 25 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in such a way that each agent receives an approximately fair share based on their preferences. Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest values to each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets approximately fair value based on the total potential value they could receive.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [8, 93, 37, 62, 32, 47]
- Agent 1 values: [19, 49, 60, 22, 64, 9]
- Agent 2 values: [40, 59, 68, 41, 25, 13]

We can allocate items as follows:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value 93 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value 60 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (second-highest value 62 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value 64 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value 40 for Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (second-highest value 13 for Agent 2).

Now, each agent has 2 items, and the total allocation is fair based on the valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
