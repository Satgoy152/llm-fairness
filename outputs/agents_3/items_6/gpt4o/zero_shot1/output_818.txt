Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  68  18  52   8  83
1  35  15  84  26  62  78
2  86  45  34  52  18  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 15 84 26 62 78]
 [86 45 34 52 18 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuation for each agent.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 will receive items that have relatively high valuations compared to other agents.
- Agent 1 will receive items that maximize their benefit from the leftover items.
- Agent 2 will get items that they value highly but are not preferred by other agents.

Given the table of valuations:

| Items \ Agents | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|----------------|----|----|----|
| 0              | 36 | 35 | 86 |
| 1              | 68 | 15 | 45 |
| 2              | 18 | 84 | 34 |
| 3              | 52 | 26 | 52 |
| 4              | 8  | 62 | 18 |
| 5              | 83 | 78 | 62 |

### Allocation Process:

1. **Assign item 0 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 86.
2. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 68.
3. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 84.
4. **Assign item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value this item equally at 52, but Agent 0 has fewer items so far.
5. **Assign item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 62.
6. **Assign item 5 to Agent 2**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 83, but Agent 2 has fewer items so far.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
