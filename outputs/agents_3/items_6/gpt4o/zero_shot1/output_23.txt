Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  60  62  52  83  84
1  22  77  56   7  70  63
2  33  90  38  57  46  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: Each agent should ideally receive 2 items, since there are 6 items and 3 agents.

2. **Calculate Total Value**: 
   - Agent 0: 91 + 60 + 62 + 52 + 83 + 84 = 432
   - Agent 1: 22 + 77 + 56 + 7 + 70 + 63 = 295
   - Agent 2: 33 + 90 + 38 + 57 + 46 + 81 = 345

3. **Assign Items to Maximize Value for Each Agent**:
   - **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 0 (91) and 5 (84).
   - **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 1 (77) and 4 (70).
   - **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 1 (90) and 5 (81).

4. **Adjust Assignments to Ensure Fairness and Completeness**:
   - Initially, assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 0, items 1 and 4 to Agent 1, and items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.
   - Re-evaluate to ensure each agent has 2 items and the total allocation is 6 items. Adjust if necessary.

5. **Final Allocation** (considering the need for fairness and ensuring that all items are allocated without overlap):

   - Agent 0: [0, 3]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]
   - Agent 2: [2, 5]

This ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
