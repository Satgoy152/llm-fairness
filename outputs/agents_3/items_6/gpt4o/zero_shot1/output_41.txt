Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  53  27  47  29  19
1  22  46  97  64  32  24
2  11  81  94  16  30  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 46 97 64 32 24]
 [11 81 94 16 30 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table to determine an optimal allocation:

Agent 0:
- High valuations for items 0 (73), 1 (53), and 3 (47).

Agent 1:
- High valuation for item 2 (97), and relatively high for item 3 (64).

Agent 2:
- High valuations for items 1 (81) and 2 (94).

We aim to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share, respecting their preferences as much as possible.

One possible allocation is:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0 and 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 2 and 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 1 and 4

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total valuation of 73 + 47 = 120
- Agent 1 a total valuation of 97 + 24 = 121
- Agent 2 a total valuation of 81 + 30 = 111

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
