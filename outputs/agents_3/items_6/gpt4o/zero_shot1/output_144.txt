Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  99  76  51  84   3
1  94  29  38  65  56  48
2  60  68  55  25  44  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's assign the items:

1. **Item 0** has the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: 8
   - Agent 1: 94
   - Agent 2: 60
   Agent 1 values it the most. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1** has the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: 99
   - Agent 1: 29
   - Agent 2: 68
   Agent 0 values it the most. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2** has the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: 76
   - Agent 1: 38
   - Agent 2: 55
   Agent 0 values it the most. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3** has the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: 51
   - Agent 1: 65
   - Agent 2: 25
   Agent 1 values it the most. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4** has the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: 84
   - Agent 1: 56
   - Agent 2: 44
   Agent 0 values it the most. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5** has the following valuations:
   - Agent 0: 3
   - Agent 1: 48
   - Agent 2: 77
   Agent 2 values it the most. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

Based on this allocation, here is the final distribution in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent has a fair share according to their valuations.
