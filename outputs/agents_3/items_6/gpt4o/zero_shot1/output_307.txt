Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18   6  35  90  80  62
1  70  38  62  26  33  94
2  90   8  21  38  86  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's try to allocate the items by considering the highest value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (90), Item 4 (80), Item 5 (62)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (94), Item 0 (70), Item 2 (62)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (90), Item 4 (86), Item 3 (38)

Based on the above analysis, we can attempt to allocate items as follows:

- **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 0 because they value it highest at 90.
- **Item 5**: Allocated to Agent 1 because they value it highest at 94.
- **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 2 because they value it highest at 90.
- **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 2 because they have the second-highest value at 86.
- **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 1 because they value it at 62.
- **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 0 because it is the remaining item, and this allocation gives Agent 0 at least one item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and all items are distributed among the agents.
