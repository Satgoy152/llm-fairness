Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  60  27  96  94  91
1  18  88  86  21  23  55
2  90   5  13  15   8  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90  5 13 15  8 99]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will try to balance the allocations so that each agent gets a share that is closest to their highest-valued items while keeping a fair distribution.

1. **Agent 0 (valuations):** 13, 60, 27, 96, 94, 91
   - Highest valued items: 3 (96), 4 (94), 5 (91)

2. **Agent 1 (valuations):** 18, 88, 86, 21, 23, 55
   - Highest valued items: 1 (88), 2 (86), 5 (55)

3. **Agent 2 (valuations):** 90, 5, 13, 15, 8, 99
   - Highest valued items: 5 (99), 0 (90), 3 (15)

### Allocation Strategy:

- Since agent 2 values item 5 the most (99), we'll allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (96), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (88), allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Now, we have allocated 3 items, and each agent has received 1 item.

For the remaining items, we try to balance based on the next highest values:

- **Agent 0** can get item 4 (94).
- **Agent 1** can get item 2 (86).
- **Agent 2** can get item 0 (90).

This way, all items are allocated, and the distribution tries to respect each agent's preferences to the maximum extent possible.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, considering their preferences and trying to maximize fairness in terms of item valuations.
