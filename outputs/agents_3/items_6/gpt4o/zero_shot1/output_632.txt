Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  99  96  61  28   7
1  95  85  44  16  41   8
2  78  29  62  96  70  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 29 62 96 70 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to maximize the overall valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is six.

Here is the analysis of the agents' valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 61
  - Item 4: 28
  - Item 5: 7

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 41
  - Item 5: 8

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 62
  - Item 3: 96
  - Item 4: 70
  - Item 5: 83

We will look for an allocation that aims to maximize the total valuation while respecting the constraint that each agent should receive at least one item:

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: Highest value (99).
2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: Highest value (95).
3. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 2**: Highest value (96).

Now, each agent has at least one item. We proceed with the remaining items:

4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Second highest value for Agent 0 (96).
5. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 2**: Second highest value for Agent 2 (70).
6. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 2**: Third highest value for Agent 2 (83).

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, Agent 1 receives item 0, and Agent 2 receives items 3, 4, and 5. This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
