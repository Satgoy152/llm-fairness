Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91   1  68  52   8  66
1  31  63  13  77  78   5
2  66  17  28  55  29  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 63 13 77 78  5]
 [66 17 28 55 29 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we aim to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation, such as the "maximum sum valuation" or "utilitarian" approach. However, since fairness can be subjective, we should aim for a solution that considers fairness in terms of equitable distribution while still maximizing the total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 91.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 78.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 66, but since item 0 is already taken, the next highest is item 3 at 55.

2. Continue assigning the remaining items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second highest for agent 0 at 66).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest for agent 1 at 63).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest for agent 2 at 28).

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on individual valuations. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
