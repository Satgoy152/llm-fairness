Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  23  74  85  83  60
1  34  17  12  63  87  39
2  51  93   7  36  28  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 93  7 36 28 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can achieve this by evaluating the valuations for each item and assigning items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring each agent gets one item first.

Let's start by determining the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest valuations: 
  - Item 3: 85
  - Item 4: 83
  - Item 2: 74
- Agent 1's highest valuations:
  - Item 4: 87
  - Item 3: 63
  - Item 0: 34
- Agent 2's highest valuations:
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 5: 88
  - Item 0: 51

A possible fair allocation would be:

1. Initially assign each agent one of their highest-valued items:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3 (85)
   - Agent 1 gets Item 4 (87)
   - Agent 2 gets Item 1 (93)

2. Now assign the remaining three items (0, 2, 5) to the agents based on their next highest valuations:
   - Agent 0 can get Item 2 (74)
   - Agent 1 can get Item 0 (34)
   - Agent 2 can get Item 5 (88)

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is based on their preferences reflected in the valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
