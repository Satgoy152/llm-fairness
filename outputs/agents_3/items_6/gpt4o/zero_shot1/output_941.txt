Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  93  47  80  96  56
1  85  36  28  24  68  67
2  72   0   5  67  37  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 93 47 80 96 56]
 [85 36 28 24 68 67]
 [72  0  5 67 37 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives a total of two items (since there are 6 items and 3 agents).

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values: [90, 93, 47, 80, 96, 56]
- Agent 1 values: [85, 36, 28, 24, 68, 67]
- Agent 2 values: [72, 0, 5, 67, 37, 73]

A fair allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets two items.

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values items 4 and 1 (96 and 93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values items 0 and 5 (85 and 67).
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values items 5 and 3 (73 and 67).

We need to ensure no overlap and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction. Let's adjust the allocation considering these valuations:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 96).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 93).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 85).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 67).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 67).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 5).

After these considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
