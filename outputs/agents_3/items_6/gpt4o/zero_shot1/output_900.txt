Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  55  75  26  77  63
1  41  37  33   4  91  25
2  94  59  41  96  83  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 37 33  4 91 25]
 [94 59 41 96 83 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [87, 55, 75, 26, 77, 63]
Agent 1: [41, 37, 33, 4, 91, 25]
Agent 2: [94, 59, 41, 96, 83, 29]
```

We aim to distribute the six items across the three agents. A possible allocation can be determined by examining each agent's top preferences and attempting to maximize the value they receive.

Let's review a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4, but since Agent 0 also likes item 4, consider giving agent 1 item 5, which is not highly valued by others.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 3. 

Based on these observations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to maximize their total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
