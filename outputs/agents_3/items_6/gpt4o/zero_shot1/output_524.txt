Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  96  99  86  11   8
1   0  77  68  71  89  63
2  97   7  99  71  14  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97  7 99 71 14 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will apply a simple allocation strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, even if the initial allocation doesn't provide it.

Let's begin the allocation:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 22
  - Agent 1 values it at 0
  - Agent 2 values it at 97
  - Best allocation: Agent 2

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 96
  - Agent 1 values it at 77
  - Agent 2 values it at 7
  - Best allocation: Agent 0

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 99
  - Agent 1 values it at 68
  - Agent 2 values it at 99
  - Best allocation: Agent 0 or Agent 2 (let's choose Agent 0 for balance)

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 86
  - Agent 1 values it at 71
  - Agent 2 values it at 71
  - Best allocation: Agent 0

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 11
  - Agent 1 values it at 89
  - Agent 2 values it at 14
  - Best allocation: Agent 1

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 8
  - Agent 1 values it at 63
  - Agent 2 values it at 48
  - Best allocation: Agent 1

Now, let's review the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Item [0]

Each agent has at least one item. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```
