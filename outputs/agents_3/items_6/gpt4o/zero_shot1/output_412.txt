Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  95  48  11  93  78
1  12  64  34  72  27  45
2  71  18  71  13  53  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 95 48 11 93 78]
 [12 64 34 72 27 45]
 [71 18 71 13 53 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents. We can approach this by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and try to allocate it to them.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Allocate the remaining items to maximize total valuation.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item Values          |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0     | 50, 95, 48, 11, 93, 78 |
| 1     | 12, 64, 34, 72, 27, 45 |
| 2     | 71, 18, 71, 13, 53, 68 |

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued items for agent 0 are item 1 (95) and item 4 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for agent 1 is item 3 (72).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued items for agent 2 are item 0 (71) and item 2 (71).

Allocating based on these values:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (95)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (72)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (71)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 2, 4, and 5:

- Item 2 is valued equally by agent 0 (48) and agent 2 (71). Assign it to agent 2 as they value it more.
- Item 4 is highly valued by agent 0 (93).
- Item 5 is valued by agent 0 (78), agent 1 (45), and agent 2 (68). Assign it to agent 0 since they have the highest value.

Final allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 4, 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 2

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
