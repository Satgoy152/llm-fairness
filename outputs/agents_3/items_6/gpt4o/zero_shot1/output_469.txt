Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  76  19  54  38  36
1  18  49  84  72  71  36
2  59  84  65  24  74  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 49 84 72 71 36]
 [59 84 65 24 74 40]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation items are 0 (97) and 1 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation items are 2 (84) and 3 (72).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation items are 4 (74) and 5 (40).

Let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 5.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items they value highly.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
