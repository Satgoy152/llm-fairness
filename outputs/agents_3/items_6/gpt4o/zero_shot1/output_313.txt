Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  27  95  64   0  23
1  98  20  25  74  80  22
2  36  21   9  17  30  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach is to use a method like maximizing total valuations or ensuring that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible based on their preferences.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step method to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Highest Value Preferences:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate Based on Preferences:**
   - Allocate items to the agents who have the highest valuation for them, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - If one agent has significantly more items or higher value total than others, adjust by reallocating some items to balance the total valuations.

Let's apply this approach:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (98).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (27).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (95).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (74).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (80).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (23).

Now, let's allocate while considering fairness:

- Initially allocate:
  - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 5] (valuations: 27, 95, 23).
  - Agent 1 gets items [0, 3, 4] (valuations: 98, 74, 80).
  - Agent 2 gets no items.

Since Agent 2 has no items, we can consider reallocating some lower-valued items from Agents 0 and 1 to Agent 2, ensuring a more balanced distribution. However, based on the initial allocation, Agents 0 and 1 each have three items, which is equitable in terms of number of items. Here, it may not be possible to give Agent 2 an item without reducing the total value significantly for Agent 0 or 1, given that Agent 2's valuations are much lower.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": []
}
```
