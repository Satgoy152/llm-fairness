Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  16  99  86   5  80
1  24  73  86   5  85  93
2  78  54  98   2  60  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 16 99 86  5 80]
 [24 73 86  5 85 93]
 [78 54 98  2 60 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated. Let's consider the valuations and perform the allocation:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [27, 16, 99, 86, 5, 80]
- Agent 1: [24, 73, 86, 5, 85, 93]
- Agent 2: [78, 54, 98, 2, 60, 35]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (78)
2. **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (73)
3. **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (99)
4. **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (86)
5. **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (85)
6. **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (93)

### Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: Item [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0]
}
```
