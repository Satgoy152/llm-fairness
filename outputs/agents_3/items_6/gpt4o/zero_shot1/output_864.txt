Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42   3  77  76  77  92
1  65  88  48  99  88  11
2  64  96  43  69  56  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 96 43 69 56 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and every item is allocated.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 2, and 4.

4. Agent 0 values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 0 more than agent 2, so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
6. Finally, we allocate item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 still needs another item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their overall valuation for the items they receive.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 6 items is distributed among the 3 agents, maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
