Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  28  68  23  11  72
1  38  98  27  47  20   5
2  37  31  30  43  98  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [37 31 30 43 98 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. The goal is to distribute the items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is balanced as much as possible. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:** [96, 28, 68, 23, 11, 72]
2. **Agent 1 Valuations:** [38, 98, 27, 47, 20, 5]
3. **Agent 2 Valuations:** [37, 31, 30, 43, 98, 72]

To maximize fairness, we can allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, attempting to distribute them evenly:

- **Step 1:** Assign items with the highest valuations to the respective agents.
  - Item 0 (value 96) is the highest for Agent 0.
  - Item 1 (value 98) is the highest for Agent 1.
  - Item 4 (value 98) is the highest for Agent 2.

- **Step 2:** Allocate the remaining items while considering each agent's next highest valuation and ensuring each agent gets items.
  - Agent 0's next highest is Item 2 (value 68).
  - Agent 2's next highest is Item 5 (value 72).
  - Agent 1's next highest is Item 3 (value 47).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (value 96), Item 2 (value 68)
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (value 98), Item 3 (value 47)
- **Agent 2:** Item 4 (value 98), Item 5 (value 72)

This distribution maximizes each agent's value while maintaining fairness. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
