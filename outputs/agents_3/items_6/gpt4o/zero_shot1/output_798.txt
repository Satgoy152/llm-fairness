Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  30  41  32  57  71
1  83  15  23  50  72   1
2  41  30  70  97  56   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 15 23 50 72  1]
 [41 30 70 97 56  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that every item is allocated to one of the agents. Here's a potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 87.
   - Next highest is item 5 with a value of 71.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 72.
   - Next highest is item 3 with a value of 50.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 97. However, since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we look at the next highest.
   - The next highest available is item 2 with a value of 70.
   - Next is item 4 with a value of 56. However, since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, we look at the next highest.
   - Next available is item 1 with a value of 30.

Allocating based on these choices, we get:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 4].
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 1].

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
