Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  68  37  97  81   7
1  65  56  28   1  62  75
2   0  27  60  99  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 56 28  1 62 75]
 [ 0 27 60 99 65 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. With 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values are for items 3 (97) and 0 (81).
   - Allocate items 3 and 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After removing items 3 and 0, the highest remaining values are for items 5 (75) and 4 (62).
   - Allocate items 5 and 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items are 1 and 2, with values 27 and 60 respectively.
   - Allocate items 2 and 1 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
