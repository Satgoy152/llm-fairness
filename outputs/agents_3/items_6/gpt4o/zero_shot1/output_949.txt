Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  76  52  94  48  25
1  94  93  91  56  78  83
2  45  22  72  70  62   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 22 72 70 62  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a method like the Hungarian algorithm or a greedy algorithm to ensure each agent gets items according to their highest valuations, while trying to balance the total number of items distributed.

Given the table:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 42 | 76 | 52 | 94 | 48 | 25 |
| 1          | 94 | 93 | 91 | 56 | 78 | 83 |
| 2          | 45 | 22 | 72 | 70 | 62 |  9 |

Let's allocate items to agents:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (94).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (94).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (72).

Now, allocate the remaining items considering each agent's preferences:

4. Agent 1 can also get item 1 (93), as it is their next highest value.
5. Agent 0 can also get item 4 (48), as it is their next highest available value.
6. The remaining item 5 can be allocated to Agent 1, who values it at 83.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes their valuations within the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [2]
}
```
