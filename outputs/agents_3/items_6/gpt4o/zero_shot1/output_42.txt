Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  59  39  92  31  75
1  17  78  62  82   2  36
2   2  89  53  18  72  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 89 53 18 72 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences. We can use the concept of maximizing overall happiness by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Values include 12, 59, 39, 92, 31, 75. Highest value is for item 3 (92).
   - Agent 1: Values include 17, 78, 62, 82, 2, 36. Highest value is for item 1 (78).
   - Agent 2: Values include 2, 89, 53, 18, 72, 10. Highest value is for item 1 (89).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to the corresponding agents:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 wants item 1 too, but since it's already taken, we give them their next highest value item which is item 4 (72).

3. **Allocate remaining items by considering next highest values:**
   - For Agent 0, after item 3, the next highest valued items are 5 (75) and 1 (59), but item 1 is taken. So, allocate item 5.
   - For Agent 1, after item 1, the next highest valued items are 3 (82) and 2 (62). Item 3 is taken, so allocate item 2.
   - For Agent 2, after item 4, the next highest valued item is 1 (89), but it's taken, then item 2 (53) which is also taken, so allocate item 0.

4. **Check if all items are allocated:**
   - We have allocated items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 1. All items are allocated.

5. **Finalize the allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items reflecting their highest possible valuations while distributing all items fairly.
