Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  86  77  99   8  84
1  73  52  58  17  97   4
2  63  90  94  40   7  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [63 90 94 40  7 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to use a "max-sum" allocation, where we try to maximize the total value across all agents. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

Agent 0's valuations: [30, 86, 77, 99, 8, 84]  
Agent 1's valuations: [73, 52, 58, 17, 97, 4]  
Agent 2's valuations: [63, 90, 94, 40, 7, 44]  

A potential fair allocation could be based on selecting the highest value for each item, ensuring each agent gets two items:

- Item 0 (30, 73, 63): Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 1 (86, 52, 90): Allocate to Agent 2
- Item 2 (77, 58, 94): Allocate to Agent 2
- Item 3 (99, 17, 40): Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 4 (8, 97, 7): Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 5 (84, 4, 44): Allocate to Agent 0

Based on the above allocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
