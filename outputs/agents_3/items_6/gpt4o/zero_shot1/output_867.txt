Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  12   7  84  58  62
1  45  58  58  62  83  59
2  43  38  34  97  22  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 58 58 62 83 59]
 [43 38 34 97 22 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value perceived by each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0 Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 84.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1 Allocation:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 83.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2 Allocation:**
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 97, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 at 43.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Remaining Allocations:**
   - Items left: 1, 2, 5.
   - Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 5 at 62.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 2 at 58.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2's next highest valuation is item 1 at 38.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

The allocations will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This way, each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all 6 items are allocated.
