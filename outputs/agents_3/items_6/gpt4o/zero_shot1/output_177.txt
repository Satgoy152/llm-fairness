Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  31  90  35  57  59
1  63  60  55   0  50  28
2  89  15  85  36  98  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [89 15 85 36 98 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 61
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 90
- Item 3: 35
- Item 4: 57
- Item 5: 59

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 60
- Item 2: 55
- Item 3: 0
- Item 4: 50
- Item 5: 28

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 15
- Item 2: 85
- Item 3: 36
- Item 4: 98
- Item 5: 14

To maximize fairness and ensure each agent gets a reasonable allocation of high-value items, we can proceed with the following allocations:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it the most.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has the least items and item 3 is valued least by Agent 0 and Agent 2.

This allocation strategy aims to distribute items in a way that respects the highest individual valuations and ensures each agent receives items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
