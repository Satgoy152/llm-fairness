Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48   8  66  79  49  21
1  31  44   8  56  87   1
2  61  93   5  72  38  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [61 93  5 72 38 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent or ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while also ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (79), 2 (66), 0 (48)
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0 (since these are the highest valued by Agent 0).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation items: 4 (87), 1 (44), 3 (56)
   - Allocate items 4 and 1 to Agent 1 (since these are the highest valued by Agent 1).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (93), 3 (72), 0 (61)
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 2 (since item 0 is still available and item 5 is the only one left).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair amount of items based on their valuations, and that all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
