Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  44  12   2  75  11
1  21  68  69  20  69  67
2  86   8  78  60   4  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86  8 78 60  4 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common method to do this is to use a type of matching algorithm or optimization approach, like the Hungarian algorithm, to find the optimal allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [89, 44, 12, 2, 75, 11]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [21, 68, 69, 20, 69, 67]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [86, 8, 78, 60, 4, 77]

The goal is to allocate 6 items such that the distribution is as fair as possible, possibly maximizing the minimum satisfaction or value across agents.

Here's a possible allocation that achieves a fair distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 89)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 68)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 78)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 60)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 69)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 11)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5 with a total value of 100
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4 with a total value of 137
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3 with a total value of 138

This distribution aims to evenly distribute the items while trying to maximize the value for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
