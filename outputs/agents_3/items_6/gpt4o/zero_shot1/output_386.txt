Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  66  87  10  51  36
1   0  64   3  85  99  36
2  81  31  66  24  40  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [81 31 66 24 40 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives. Here's one approach to do that:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 1 highly with values 83, 87, and 66 respectively.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 4 and 3 highly with values 99 and 85 respectively.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 5 highly with value 96.

Letâ€™s allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the total value perceived by each agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
