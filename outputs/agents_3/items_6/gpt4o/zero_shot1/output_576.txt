Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  29  18  12  44  10
1  75  82  47   3  84  42
2  86  97  30  31  31  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We'll examine the valuations and distribute the items in a way that allows each agent to have a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by assigning the highest valued item for Agent 0. The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a valuation of 86.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign the highest valued item for Agent 1. The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 with a valuation of 84.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign the highest valued item for Agent 2. The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 with a valuation of 97.

Now each agent has one item. We will continue to allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

4. **Agent 0**: The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 4 with a valuation of 44, but it is already taken. The next highest available is item 1 with a valuation of 29, but it is also taken. Assign item 2 with a valuation of 18.
5. **Agent 1**: The next highest available for Agent 1 is item 0, but it is taken. Assign item 5 with a valuation of 42.
6. **Agent 2**: The next available item for Agent 2 is item 5, but it is taken. Assign item 3 with a valuation of 31.

Let's check the item allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 has items 1 and 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
