Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  12  17  14  85  31
1  60  51  51  81  55  84
2  92   6  85   7  95  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. A common approach is to try to maximize the total value perceived by all agents combined while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total perceived value:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (value 99).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item is item 3 (value 81).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item is item 4 (value 95).

After allocating the highest valued item to each agent, we have the following items allocated:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 4

Now let's allocate the remaining items 1, 2, and 5:

- For item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 51, Agent 2 values it at 6.
  - Highest value is for Agent 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

- For item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 values it at 51, Agent 2 values it at 85.
  - Highest value is for Agent 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

- For item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 84, Agent 2 values it at 13.
  - Highest value is for Agent 1, so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, we have allocated all 6 items:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
