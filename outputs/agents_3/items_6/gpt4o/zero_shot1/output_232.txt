Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  36  57  11  22  71
1  45  80  17  65  66  36
2  64  22  76  86  27  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 80 17 65 66 36]
 [64 22 76 86 27 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are three agents and six items, each agent can receive two items). Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Evaluate Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [27, 36, 57, 11, 22, 71]
   - Agent 1: [45, 80, 17, 65, 66, 36]
   - Agent 2: [64, 22, 76, 86, 27, 33]

2. **Find the highest value for each item among the agents:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (64)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (80)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (76)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (86)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (66)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (71)

3. **Allocate items based on the highest value:**
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item by adjusting allocations if needed.

4. **Propose Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]
   - Agent 2: [0, 2, 3]

5. **Adjust the allocation if needed to ensure fairness:**
   - Agent 0 should receive another item to balance the allocation. Since Agent 0 values item 2 highly (57), we can adjust the allocation of item 2 to Agent 0.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [2, 5]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]
   - Agent 2: [0, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
