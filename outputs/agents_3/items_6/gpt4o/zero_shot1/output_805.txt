Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  60  23  67  83  57
1  84  36  74  66  78  40
2  17  11  96  15  32  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method like the "max-min fair share" or similar equitable distribution strategies. 

Given the valuations from the table, let's proceed with an allocation that tries to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

Agent 0's valuations: 
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 60
- Item 2: 23
- Item 3: 67
- Item 4: 83
- Item 5: 57

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 84
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 74
- Item 3: 66
- Item 4: 78
- Item 5: 40

Agent 2's valuations:
- Item 0: 17
- Item 1: 11
- Item 2: 96
- Item 3: 15
- Item 4: 32
- Item 5: 61

Considering these valuations, a fair allocation would be:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (83 is the highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (84 is the highest valuation for Agent 1).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (96 is the highest valuation for Agent 2).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (67 is the next highest for Agent 0 after Item 4).
5. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (61 is the next highest for Agent 2 after Item 2).
6. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (36 is the next highest for Agent 1 after Item 0).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and it reasonably balances the total value each agent receives based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction for each agent according to their item valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.
