Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  55  17  53  53  53
1  13  63  15  94  54  86
2  83  91  48  50   6  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 63 15 94 54 86]
 [83 91 48 50  6 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We can approach this problem using a simple method where we look for the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the respective agent. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Agent 2 values it at 91
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest valuation)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 94
   - Agent 2 values it at 50
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 6
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

So, the allocations would be:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 2]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
