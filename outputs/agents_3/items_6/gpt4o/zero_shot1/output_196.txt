Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13   1  52  61  25  79
1  81  40  57  93  90  99
2  95   2  59  97   6  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that balances the total value each agent receives. One possible approach is to use a greedy allocation method where each agent receives the item they value the most, provided that item is still available.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 5 (value of 79).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5 (value of 99), but since item 5 is already allocated, we allocate item 3 (value of 93).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 (value of 97), but since item 3 is already allocated, we allocate item 0 (value of 95).

Now let's allocate the remaining items, considering the next most valued items for each agent:

4. **Agent 0**: The next highest item is item 3 (value of 61), but item 3 is already allocated. The next available highest is item 2 (value of 52).
5. **Agent 1**: The next available highest is item 4 (value of 90).
6. **Agent 2**: The next available highest is item 1 (value of 2), but this is too low compared to others. We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it more (value of 1), and allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value of 6).

This results in the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 2, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

Here's the resulting JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
