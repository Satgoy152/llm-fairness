Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  55  88  46   7  43
1  16  38  98  58  44  46
2  55  92  60  83  43  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 92 60 83 43 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation, we can use a strategy where each agent receives items that they value highly compared to the others. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:** Look for the items where each agent has a relatively higher valuation compared to others.

2. **Allocate items to maximize individual agent satisfaction:** Assign items to agents such that each agent receives items that provide them with the highest relative value.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Given these steps, let's analyze the table and perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Prefers Item 2 (88) and Item 1 (55) relatively more compared to other items.
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Prefers Item 2 (98), but it's already allocated. Next, Item 3 (58) and Item 5 (46) are highly valued.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Prefers Item 1 (92) and Item 3 (83), but Item 1 is already allocated. Next, Item 0 (55) is a good choice.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [2, 0]
- **Agent 1:** [3, 5]
- **Agent 2:** [1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while all items are distributed among the agents.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
