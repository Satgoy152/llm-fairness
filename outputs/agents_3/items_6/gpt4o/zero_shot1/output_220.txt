Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  17  73  52  63  12
1  75  76  87  77  64  64
2  27  20  87  51  13   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 20 87 51 13  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by giving each agent the items they value most while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 73)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 4 (value 63)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 3 (value 52)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 87)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 1 (value 76)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 0 (value 75)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 87)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 3 (value 51)
   - Next highest valued item: Item 0 (value 27)

Based on these valuations, we aim to allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 and Item 3 (total value 115)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 and Item 1 (total value 163)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 and Item 5 (total value 31)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while allocating all 6 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
