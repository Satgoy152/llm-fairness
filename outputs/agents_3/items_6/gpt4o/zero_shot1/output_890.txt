Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  90  73  64  60  56
1   3  65  16  80  37  92
2   1  61  90  22  69   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. A common approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent's assigned items while ensuring every agent receives at least one item.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 39, 90, 73, 64, 60, 56
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 3, 65, 16, 80, 37, 92
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 1, 61, 90, 22, 69, 9

Let's assign items to maximize satisfaction:

1. **Assign the highest value items to each agent**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (90), item 2 (73).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 5 (92), item 3 (80).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (90), item 4 (69).

2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item**:
   - Balancing the allocations, we might prioritize based on overall fairness and distribution.

Considering the above points, we can fairly distribute the items as follows:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 and item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 and item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to utilize the last remaining item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable set of items based on their valuations, given the constraint of 6 items total.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
