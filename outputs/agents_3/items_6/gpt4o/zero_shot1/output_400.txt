Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  34   3  78  56  40
1  45  92  31   8  64  11
2   9  11  63  31  13   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 34  3 78 56 40]
 [45 92 31  8 64 11]
 [ 9 11 63 31 13  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0 valuations: [92, 34, 3, 78, 56, 40]
Agent 1 valuations: [45, 92, 31, 8, 64, 11]
Agent 2 valuations: [9, 11, 63, 31, 13, 3]
```

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 92.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 63.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 78.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 64.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 40.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
