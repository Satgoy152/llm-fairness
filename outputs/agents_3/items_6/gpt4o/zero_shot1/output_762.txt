Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  70  64  75  77  74
1  67  25  45  91  48  55
2  35  39  24  78  93   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple greedy approach. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Determine the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 67.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 70.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 64.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.

2. **Assign the items:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 5
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 3
   - Agent 2: Item 4

3. **Check allocation fairness:**
   - Each agent has received at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
