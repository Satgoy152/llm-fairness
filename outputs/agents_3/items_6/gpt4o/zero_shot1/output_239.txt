Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  85  87  33  41  55
1  63  43  53  78  56  46
2  47  52  68  73  50  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 52 68 73 50 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, letâ€™s aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can approach this by examining each agent's valuation of the items and then distributing the items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: [49, 85, 87, 33, 41, 55]
- Agent 1 values items: [63, 43, 53, 78, 56, 46]
- Agent 2 values items: [47, 52, 68, 73, 50, 97]

One straightforward way to start this allocation is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 63, the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 85, the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 87, the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 78, the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 56, the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 97, the highest.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 2]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 2 gets item [5]

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent that values it the most while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
