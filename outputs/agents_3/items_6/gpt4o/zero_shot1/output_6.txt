Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  35  68  18  14  63
1  42  67   1  33  14  64
2  13  92  97  92  69  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Given there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items accordingly:

**Valuations:**
- Agent 0: [3, 35, 68, 18, 14, 63]
- Agent 1: [42, 67, 1, 33, 14, 64]
- Agent 2: [13, 92, 97, 92, 69, 58]

**Allocation Strategy:**
1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuations first while ensuring an even distribution.
2. Ensure each agent gets approximately the same number of items.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**
1. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (97), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
2. Agent 2 also has a high valuation for item 1 (92), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (42), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
4. Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 5 (64), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
5. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (18), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
6. Agent 0 also has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (14), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

**JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
