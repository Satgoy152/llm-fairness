Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  50  12  96  67  28
1  41  89  68   4  43  45
2  34  62  91  13  39  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 62 91 13 39 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible, given their individual preferences for the items. Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (96)
   - Next highest valuations: Item 0 (74), Item 4 (67)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (89)
   - Next highest valuations: Item 2 (68), Item 5 (45)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (98)
   - Next highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 1 (62)

Following a max-sum valuation approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 3 (96)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 1 (89) and Item 2 (68)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 5 (98) and Item 0 (34)
- Remaining item (Item 4) can be allocated to Agent 0 as it's their next highest preference after Item 3.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations among the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
