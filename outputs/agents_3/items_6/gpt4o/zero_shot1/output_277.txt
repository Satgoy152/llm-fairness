Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  48  25  71  30  35
1  88  78  56  60  19  72
2  42  95  74  47  65  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3: Value = 71
   - Item 0: Value = 0
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 71

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 5: Value = 72
   - Item 2: Value = 56
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 128

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 1: Value = 95
   - Item 4: Value = 65
   - Total value for Agent 2 = 160

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to balance the value each agent receives. Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and ensures that all six items are distributed.
