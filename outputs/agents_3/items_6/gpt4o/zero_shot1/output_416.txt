Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  83  42  88  83  79
1  73  83  67  20  21  69
2  73  60   5   1  89  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 60  5  1 89 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we'll use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items based on each agent's highest valuations for unallocated items.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [69, 83, 42, 88, 83, 79]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [73, 83, 67, 20, 21, 69]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [73, 60, 5, 1, 89, 53]

We will start by allocating items one by one, giving each item to the agent who values it the most, and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (88). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (89). Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (83). Allocate to Agent 0 (breaking tie arbitrarily).
4. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (73). Allocate to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 already has two items).
5. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (79). Allocate to Agent 0 (now has three items).
6. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (67). Allocate to Agent 1 (now has two items).

### Final Allocations

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 1, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 2**: Item [4]

### JSON Representation

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4]
}
```

Each agent has received an integer number of items, and all 6 items have been allocated.
