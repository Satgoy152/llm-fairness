Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  52   1   9  28  17
1   2  19  18  80  38  67
2   8  24  76  53  45   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, considering each agent's valuations. We'll use a simple method to allocate the items based on each agent's highest value for each item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Values: [81, 52, 1, 9, 28, 17]
  - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 81)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Values: [2, 19, 18, 80, 38, 67]
  - Highest valued item: Item 3 (value 80)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Values: [8, 24, 76, 53, 45, 5]
  - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 76)

Now, we allocate the remaining items based on the next highest values:

1. **Agent 0** has item 0, next highest values are item 1 (52) and item 4 (28).
2. **Agent 1** has item 3, next highest values are item 5 (67) and item 4 (38).
3. **Agent 2** has item 2, next highest values are item 3 (53) and item 1 (24).

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value 52)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (value 67)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (value 45)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their total value based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
