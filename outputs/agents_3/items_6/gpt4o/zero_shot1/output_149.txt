Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  75  43   0  98  81
1  66  12  64  10  22   0
2  44  26  56  96  79  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 75 43  0 98 81]
 [66 12 64 10 22  0]
 [44 26 56 96 79 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method known as "round-robin" allocation or focus on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least some items, if possible.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [99, 75, 43, 0, 98, 81]
Agent 1: [66, 12, 64, 10, 22, 0]
Agent 2: [44, 26, 56, 96, 79, 25]
```

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent.
2. Then continue assigning the next highest value that hasn't been allocated, ensuring each agent gets a fairly balanced allocation in terms of total value.

Below is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 99) and Item 4 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 64) and Item 1 (value 12)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value 96) and Item 5 (value 25)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items available.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
