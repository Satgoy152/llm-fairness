Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  54  99   3  56  16
1  90  49  64  27  99  39
2  82  61   4  13  17  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 54 99  3 56 16]
 [90 49 64 27 99 39]
 [82 61  4 13 17 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple strategy where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent receives items that are most valuable to them according to the given table.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 37
  - Agent 1 values at 90
  - Agent 2 values at 82
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value of 90).

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 54
  - Agent 1 values at 49
  - Agent 2 values at 61
  - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value of 61).

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 99
  - Agent 1 values at 64
  - Agent 2 values at 4
  - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value of 99).

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 3
  - Agent 1 values at 27
  - Agent 2 values at 13
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value of 27).

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 56
  - Agent 1 values at 99
  - Agent 2 values at 17
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value of 99).

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 16
  - Agent 1 values at 39
  - Agent 2 values at 36
  - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value of 39).

Now, let's compile this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 6.
