Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  47  20  13  54  70
1   4  52   3  96  64  41
2  33  69  47  88  17  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A common approach is to start by assigning the highest-valued item to each agent, then allocate the remaining items in a way that balances the total value among the agents.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Find the highest-valued item for each agent and assign it to them.
2. Allocate the remaining items by selecting the highest available value for any agent, ensuring that the total number of items allocated is six.

Based on the provided valuations, here is a step-by-step allocation:

### Initial Allocation
- Agent 0: Assign item 0 (value 82)
- Agent 1: Assign item 3 (value 96)
- Agent 2: Assign item 3 (value 88)

### Remaining Items
Items 1, 2, 4, 5 are left to be allocated. 

### Assigning Remaining Items
- **Agent 0**: Highest remaining value is item 5 (value 70)
- **Agent 1**: Next highest value left is item 4 (value 64)
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value left is item 1 (value 69)

Since we need to distribute exactly 6 items, let's review and ensure that the allocation is balanced in terms of value. 

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 1]

Now, letâ€™s express this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
