Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  29  78  49  47  23
1  58  34  56  24  27  72
2   1   9  48  11  82  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest-valued items first. We'll attempt to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 0 (85), item 2 (78), and item 3 (49). We can assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for item 5 (72), item 2 (56), and item 0 (58). We can assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for item 4 (82), item 2 (48), and item 1 (9). We can assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has one item. Let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0** can also take item 2, as it is their second-highest valued item.
5. **Agent 1** can take item 1, which is the next highest available value for them.
6. **Agent 2** can take item 3, which is the next highest available value for them.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Now, all 6 items have been allocated. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
