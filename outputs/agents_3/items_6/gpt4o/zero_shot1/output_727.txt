Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  26  26  19  76  58
1  38  87  67  71  15  33
2   7  72  16  82  74  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 72 16 82 74 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (93).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (87).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (82).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 4, and 5) while considering how to keep the allocation fair and maximize overall satisfaction:

4. **Agent 0:**
   - Consider assigning item 4 to agent 0, as they have a relatively high valuation for it (76).

5. **Agent 1:**
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it relatively highly (67).

6. **Agent 2:**
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they value it fairly well (50).

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed based on maximizing agent valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
