Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  16  66   8  23  85
1  64  21  41  77  95  37
2  50  17  77  62  64   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 21 41 77 95 37]
 [50 17 77 62 64  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 but must be allocated at least one item.

Given these considerations, here's a potential allocation that balances the distribution:

- Assign item 0 and item 5 to Agent 0 (valuations: 74, 85).
- Assign item 3 and item 4 to Agent 1 (valuations: 77, 95).
- Assign item 1 and item 2 to Agent 2 (valuations: 17, 77).

This respects the need to allocate all items and ensures each agent receives at least one item.

Now, in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
