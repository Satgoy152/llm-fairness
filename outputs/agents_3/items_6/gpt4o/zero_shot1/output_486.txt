Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76   3  90  58  40  44
1  50  54   4  24  41  96
2  67  21  42  20  71  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the overall satisfaction or valuation each agent has for the items they receive. This can often be approached by attempting to maximize the sum of the valuations for each allocation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations on items 0, 2
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 5
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations on items 4, 5

To maximize the total satisfaction, we can try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1** receives item 5
- **Agent 2** receives items 1, 3, and 4

Let's verify the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2 → 76 + 90 = 166
- Agent 1: Item 5 → 96
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, and 4 → 21 + 20 + 71 = 112

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
