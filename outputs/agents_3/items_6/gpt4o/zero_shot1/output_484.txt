Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  98  67  67   8  80
1  71  73  40  33  99   5
2  84  29  60   0  44   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items where each agent has relatively high valuations, ensuring a balanced distribution. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value items 1 and 0. Assigning these items to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: They highly value items 4 and 1. Since item 1 is already taken by Agent 0 and item 4 is still available, we can assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 0, but it's already taken by Agent 0. Their next highest valuations are for item 2 and item 0. We will assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Now, distribute the remaining items (3 and 5) in a way that balances the number of items each agent receives. Agent 1 can get item 3, and item 5 can be given to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
