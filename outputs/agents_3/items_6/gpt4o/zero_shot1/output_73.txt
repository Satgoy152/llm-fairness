Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  67  78  99   9  98
1  26  96   2  67  86  18
2  43  31   9  25  82  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations for the items and attempts to maximize overall satisfaction. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 and 3 the most, both at 99.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 96.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 82.

To ensure a fair distribution, we can assign:

- Items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, we have 3 more items to allocate (2, 5, and another one from the already allocated):

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 for balance, as it has a decent valuation of 78.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it has a decent valuation of 47.
- To balance allocation, assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, and 3
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 5

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
