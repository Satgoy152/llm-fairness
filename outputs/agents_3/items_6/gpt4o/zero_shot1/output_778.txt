Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  95  74  88  30  89
1   4  22  55  81   8  65
2  58  21  83  95  75  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a method like "maximum sum assignment" from combinatorial optimization or to iteratively allocate the highest valued items to each agent until all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations for items 1 and 5 (95 and 89, respectively).
2. **Agent 1**: They have a high valuation for item 3 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: They have high valuations for items 2 and 3 (83 and 95, respectively).

Let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (95), Item 5 (89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (81)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (83), Item 4 (75)
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (60) (since agent 0 still has a strong preference for this item)

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their valuations to the extent possible.
