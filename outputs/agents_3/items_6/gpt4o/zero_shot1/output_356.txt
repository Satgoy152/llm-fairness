Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  41  30  19  26  41
1  21  12  37  63  62  62
2  39  56   6   8  85  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 56  6  8 85 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will also ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, given the constraint of 6 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Consider the highest value items: Items 1 and 5 both have a value of 41.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value items for this agent are items 3, 4, and 5, each with a value of 62 or 63.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (value 63).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value item for this agent is item 4 (value 85).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining high-value items are 0 and 5.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0 (value 41).

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (value 21).

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (value 6).

Now, each agent has received two items, and all six items have been allocated fairly. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
