Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12   5  61  87  92   9
1  84  21   6  25  73  90
2  55  49  20   1  11  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12  5 61 87 92  9]
 [84 21  6 25 73 90]
 [55 49 20  1 11 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to balance the overall satisfaction across agents. One possible approach is to assign items in such a way that tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction level among all agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0: [12, 5, 61, 87, 92, 9]
Agent 1: [84, 21, 6, 25, 73, 90]
Agent 2: [55, 49, 20, 1, 11, 75]

We can try to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, considering the overall balance.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (92) and item 3 (87).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (84) and item 5 (90).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (75) and item 0 (55).

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highest.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest value for Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it is the highest value for Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest value for Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than other remaining items.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is the next highest value for Agent 2.

Now, we have assigned all 6 items:

Agent 0: [3, 4]
Agent 1: [0, 5]
Agent 2: [1, 2]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
