Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  51  78  52  74  74
1   5  51  59  87  56  96
2  66  18  11   8  36  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Best items based on value: 2 (78), 4 (74), 5 (74)
   - Allocate: Items 2 and 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best items based on value: 5 (96), 3 (87), 2 (59)
   - Allocate: Items 5 and 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best items based on value: 0 (66), 5 (70)
   - Allocate: Item 0 to Agent 2

Now, let's ensure each item is allocated and consider any changes:

- Agent 0: Has items 2 and 4
- Agent 1: Has items 5 and 3
- Agent 2: Has item 0
  
Unallocated item: 1

Let's reassess item 1:

- Agent 0 values item 1 at 51
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 51
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 18

Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has a tie with Agent 1 but Agent 1 already has high valued items).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 1
- Agent 1: Items 5, 3
- Agent 2: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```
