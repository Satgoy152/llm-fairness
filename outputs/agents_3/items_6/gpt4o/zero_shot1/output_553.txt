Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  46  44   4   2  42
1  11  72  49  34  59  43
2  79  22  73   7  88  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [79 22 73  7 88 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (42), followed by item 1 (46), and item 2 (44). 
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (72), but since item 1 is already assigned to Agent 0, we check the next highest.
   - Item 4 has the next highest valuation (59) for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (88), but since item 4 is assigned to Agent 1, check the next highest.
   - Item 0 has the next highest valuation (79) for Agent 2.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's continue to allocate the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest unallocated item for Agent 0 is item 2 (44).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Next highest unallocated item for Agent 1 is item 2 (49) which is already assigned to Agent 0, so consider item 5 (43).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign the remaining item, item 3 (7), to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values it the least, balancing the allocations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
