Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  60  50  47  52  90
1  13  20  21  77  57  43
2  71  67  41  68  22  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 67 41 68 22 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since there are 3 agents and 6 items, this is feasible). We will consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items to balance the perceived total value.

Let's evaluate the highest values each agent has for the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations: Item 5 (90), Item 1 (60), Item 4 (52)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (77), Item 4 (57), Item 5 (43)
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations: Item 0 (71), Item 3 (68), Item 1 (67)

Now, let's allocate based on trying to ensure each agent receives high-valued items they prefer:

1. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 highly values this item (90).
2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: This is the highest value for Agent 1 (77).
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 (71).

Now, allocate the remaining items while considering the next highest values:

4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this (60), and it provides the next highest value not yet assigned.
5. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this (50), completing their allocation.
6. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this (57), completing their allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high valuations, and all 6 items are distributed among the agents.
