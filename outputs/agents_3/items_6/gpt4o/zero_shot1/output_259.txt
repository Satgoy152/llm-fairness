Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  96  23  76  14  47
1  18   1  97  47  72  91
2  61  38  82  10  36  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18  1 97 47 72 91]
 [61 38 82 10 36 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction. A simple approach could be to allocate the highest-valued items to each agent based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Their highest valuation is for item 1 (96), followed by item 3 (76).
2. Agent 1: Their highest valuation is for item 2 (97), followed by item 5 (91).
3. Agent 2: Their highest valuation is for item 2 (82), but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1, we consider item 5 (62) and item 0 (61). 

Given these considerations, let's make the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and attempts to respect the agents' preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
