Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  95  95  37  97   2
1  63  93   5  56  36  20
2  53  59  80  61  74  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 93  5 56 36 20]
 [53 59 80 61 74 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [80, 95, 95, 37, 97, 2]
- Agent 1: [63, 93, 5, 56, 36, 20]
- Agent 2: [53, 59, 80, 61, 74, 55]

To proceed, I'll allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value based on their preferences:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 4 and 1 (97 and 95), so we'll allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 0 (93 and 63), but since item 1 is already taken, Agent 1 will receive item 0.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 2 and 4 (80 and 74), but since item 4 is already taken, Agent 2 will receive item 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3 and 5):

- Agent 0 already has items 4 and 1, with high valuations.
- Agent 1 could benefit from item 3 (56) as it adds significant value.
- Agent 2 could take item 5 to maximize their allocation.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: items 1, 4
- Agent 1: items 0, 3
- Agent 2: items 2, 5

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
