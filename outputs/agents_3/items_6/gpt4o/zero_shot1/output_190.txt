Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  30   0  53   2  72
1  84  42  45  50  16  57
2  34  12  62  67  62  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, continuing until all items are allocated. Here's how the allocation can be done based on the values given:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 84
   - Agent 2 values it at 34
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 30
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 12
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 50
   - Agent 2 values it at 67
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 2
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 57
   - Agent 2 values it at 42
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value).

After applying this allocation strategy, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most.
