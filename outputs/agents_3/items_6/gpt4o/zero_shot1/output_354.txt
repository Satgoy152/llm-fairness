Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  92  73  40  82   5
1  69  53  85   1  99  86
2   8  75  15  98   8  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that all items are allocated without any overlaps.

Let's look at each agent's preferences:

- Agent 0: Values items highest as follows: Item 1 (92), Item 4 (82), Item 2 (73), Item 3 (40), Item 0 (38), Item 5 (5).
- Agent 1: Values items highest as follows: Item 4 (99), Item 5 (86), Item 2 (85), Item 0 (69), Item 1 (53), Item 3 (1).
- Agent 2: Values items highest as follows: Item 3 (98), Item 1 (75), Item 5 (16), Item 2 (15), Item 0 (8), Item 4 (8).

A fair allocation can be determined by choosing the highest value items for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (92), Item 4 (82), Item 2 (73)
   - Allocate: Item 1 (92)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 5 (86), Item 2 (85)
   - Allocate: Item 4 (99), Item 5 (86)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 1 (75)
   - Allocate: Item 3 (98), Item 2 (15), Item 0 (8)

Let's ensure all items are allocated and there are no overlaps:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: [1]
- Items allocated to Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Items allocated to Agent 2: [3, 2, 0]

All items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 2, 0]
}
```
