Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  77  40  30  38  49
1  57  99  36  97  71  76
2  35  70  80  55  67  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 77 40 30 38 49]
 [57 99 36 97 71 76]
 [35 70 80 55 67 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total values while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's take a closer look at the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [66, 77, 40, 30, 38, 49]
- Agent 1: [57, 99, 36, 97, 71, 76]
- Agent 2: [35, 70, 80, 55, 67, 67]

One strategy is to assign each agent their highest valued item first, and then distribute the remaining items to maximize total value.

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (77)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (99) (instead, assign Item 3 for variety and fairness)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (80)

2. Allocate remaining items to balance and maximize the benefit for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (66), Item 5 (49)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (71)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (55)

This ensures each agent has at least one item, and we've balanced the allocation while considering their preferences. The total number of items allocated is 6.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
