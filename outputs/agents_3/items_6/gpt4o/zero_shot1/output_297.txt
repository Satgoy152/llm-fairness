Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  86  45  93  63  59
1  13  49  62  82  57  27
2  86   5  65  29  68  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the agents' preferences as shown by their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value for agent 0 at 93.
   - Item 1 has the second-highest value for agent 0 at 86.
   - Item 5 has a relatively high value for agent 0 at 59.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 has the highest value for agent 1 at 62.
   - Item 4 has the second-highest value for agent 1 at 57.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0 has the highest value for agent 2 at 86.

With these considerations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, while all six items are fairly distributed.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
