Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  43  54  47  86  35
1  40  23  73  71  27  14
2  39  94  34  45  10  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that the allocations are balanced and possibly maximize the total value for each agent. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (86), 2 (54)
   - Allocate item 4 (highest value) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (73), 3 (71)
   - Allocate item 2 (highest remaining value) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (94), 3 (45)
   - Allocate item 1 (highest value) to Agent 2.

4. **Back to Agent 0:**
   - Remaining highest value items: 0 (43), 3 (47)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Back to Agent 1:**
   - Remaining highest value items: 0 (40), 5 (14)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

6. **Back to Agent 2:**
   - Remaining item: 5 (30)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

The final allocation will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent as much as possible given the constraints.
