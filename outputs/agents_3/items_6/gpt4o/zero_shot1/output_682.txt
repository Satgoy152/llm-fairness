Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  76  72  52  47   2
1  39  70  24   9  25  99
2  63  70  32   4  18  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 76 72 52 47  2]
 [39 70 24  9 25 99]
 [63 70 32  4 18 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the highest (99), so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the highest (99), so item 5 should be allocated to them.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the highest (70), so item 1 should be allocated to them.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, and 4). We can assign them based on the next highest values from the remaining agents:

4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, who values it at 72, the highest among the remaining options for them.
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, who values it at 9, the highest among the remaining options for them.
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, who values it at 18, the highest among the remaining options for them.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
