Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  50   6   8  50   7
1  13  42  70  41  93   1
2  77  58  64  69  59  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 42 70 41 93  1]
 [77 58 64 69 59 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's consider the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item is 60 (item 0).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item is 93 (item 4).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item is 99 (item 5).

Let's allocate these high-value items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.

Now, allocate the remaining items to balance the allocations:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 3.
- Agent 0's remaining highest value: item 1 (50).
- Agent 1's remaining highest value: item 2 (70).
- Agent 2's remaining highest value: item 3 (69).

Allocate these items:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Now each agent has two items:

- Agent 0: items 0, 1.
- Agent 1: items 4, 2.
- Agent 2: items 5, 3.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
