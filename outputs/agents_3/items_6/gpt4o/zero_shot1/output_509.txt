Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  81  48  33  14   2
1  71  48  73  32  48  66
2  60  88  21  59  97   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 48 73 32 48 66]
 [60 88 21 59 97  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction or value across all agents. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most. Hereâ€™s how the allocations can be determined:

1. **Agent 0's Values:** [3, 81, 48, 33, 14, 2]
2. **Agent 1's Values:** [71, 48, 73, 32, 48, 66]
3. **Agent 2's Values:** [60, 88, 21, 59, 97, 0]

Let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 71, Agent 2 values it at 60, and Agent 0 values it at 3. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it at 88, Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 2 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it at 59, Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 48, and Agent 0 values it at 14. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it at 66, Agent 0 values it at 2, and Agent 2 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total allocation is 6 items.
