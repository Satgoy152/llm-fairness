Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  66  83  17  68  24
1  41  44  72  38  23  63
2  41  14  77   4  58  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 44 72 38 23 63]
 [41 14 77  4 58 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 3 agents and 6 items, ideally, each agent should get 2 items.

Let's allocate the items by examining the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Values: [51, 66, 83, 17, 68, 24]

Agent 1:
- Values: [41, 44, 72, 38, 23, 63]

Agent 2:
- Values: [41, 14, 77, 4, 58, 22]

A possible allocation could be to give each agent the items they value the most, ensuring no item is double-allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 2 (83) and 4 (68).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 2 (72) and 5 (63), but item 2 is already taken, so we choose items 5 (63) and 1 (44) for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 2 (77) and 4 (58), but both are taken, so we choose items 0 (41) and 3 (4).

Re-evaluating, we find a better allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2 (83) and 1 (66).
- Agent 1: Items 5 (63) and 3 (38).
- Agent 2: Items 0 (41) and 4 (58).

This allocation gives each agent two items and tries to maximize their individual valuations. 

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
