Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  11  81  26  88  44
1  78  63  99  73  70  32
2  55  67  81  64  38  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 63 99 73 70 32]
 [55 67 81 64 38 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the matrix of valuations, let's try to allocate the items so that the total valuation for each agent is maximized.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are item 4 (88) and item 2 (81).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are item 2 (99), item 0 (78), and item 3 (73).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are item 2 (81) and item 1 (67).
   - Since item 2 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 5) considering the next highest valuations for each agent:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Next best option is item 3 with a value of 26.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Next best option is item 0 with a value of 78.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as it is the best remaining option for Agent 2 with a value of 47.

After this allocation, each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
