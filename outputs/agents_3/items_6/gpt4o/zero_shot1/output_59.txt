Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  15  54  88  24  15
1  94  97  21  36  95  84
2  43  40   7  90  79  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive for every possible subset of items.
2. Try to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets at least one item and the total allocation is fair in terms of value distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on maximizing the values:

- Agent 0 values: [76, 15, 54, 88, 24, 15]
- Agent 1 values: [94, 97, 21, 36, 95, 84]
- Agent 2 values: [43, 40, 7, 90, 79, 76]

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (value 88) and item 0 (value 76).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value 97) and item 4 (value 95).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (value 7) and item 5 (value 76).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on the preferences provided.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the 3 agents while attempting to balance the values each agent receives.
