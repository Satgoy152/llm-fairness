Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  69  89  56  44  71
1   3  32   8  94  64  18
2  68  11  48  89   6  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 32  8 94 64 18]
 [68 11 48 89  6 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can consider a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Each agent should receive at least one item, to the extent possible, while considering their preferences.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [65, 69, 89, 56, 44, 71]
- Agent 1 values: [3, 32, 8, 94, 64, 18]
- Agent 2 values: [68, 11, 48, 89, 6, 97]

We will allocate items to agents based on their highest preference values:

1. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values are for items 5 (97) and 3 (89). 
   - Allocate items 5 and 3 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest remaining values are for items 2 (89) and 1 (69).
   - Allocate items 2 and 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest remaining values are for items 4 (64) and 0 (3).
   - Allocate items 4 and 0 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, every agent has received at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
