Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  52  21  81  31  61
1   0  20  76  17  29  38
2  89  36  93  19  96   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Consider the total value each agent can receive from all items:
   - Agent 0: 53 + 52 + 21 + 81 + 31 + 61 = 299
   - Agent 1: 0 + 20 + 76 + 17 + 29 + 38 = 180
   - Agent 2: 89 + 36 + 93 + 19 + 96 + 2 = 335

2. To balance the allocation, assign the highest value items to each agent such that they all receive similar total values:

   - Agent 0 values: 
     - Item 3: 81
     - Item 5: 61
     - Item 0: 53

   - Agent 1 values:
     - Item 2: 76
     - Item 4: 29

   - Agent 2 values:
     - Item 4: 96
     - Item 2: 93
     - Item 0: 89

3. Allocate items based on the highest values for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

   - Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [2, 3]
   - Agent 2 receives items: [4, 5]

4. Check if the allocation satisfies all conditions and that only 6 items are allocated:

   - Agent 0: [0, 1] → Total Value = 53 + 52 = 105
   - Agent 1: [2, 3] → Total Value = 76 + 17 = 93
   - Agent 2: [4, 5] → Total Value = 96 + 2 = 98

5. Present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fairly balanced distribution of items based on the agents' valuations.
