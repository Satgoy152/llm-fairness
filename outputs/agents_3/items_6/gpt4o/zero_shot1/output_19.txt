Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  18  57  80  72   6
1  94  95  20  85  60   3
2  87  18  31  78  85  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [87 18 31 78 85 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One approach is to use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on valuations. Let's try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest valuation: 94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest valuation: 95).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (highest valuation: 57).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (highest valuation: 80).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (highest valuation: 85).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (remaining item, agent 2 has a reasonable valuation of 20).

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
