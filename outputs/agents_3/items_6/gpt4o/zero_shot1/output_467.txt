Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  84  93  83  24   2
1  32  65  98  90   0  36
2  86  60  67  46  69   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 60 67 46 69  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we need to maximize the total value for each agent. A common method to achieve this is to use an optimization approach like the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. However, due to the simplicity of this problem, we can manually allocate the items by inspecting the valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [29, 84, 93, 83, 24, 2]
- Agent 1: [32, 65, 98, 90, 0, 36]
- Agent 2: [86, 60, 67, 46, 69, 3]

To allocate fairly, we want to consider each agent's highest valuation and distribute the items accordingly:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value = 93).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value = 98), but since item 2 is already taken, we look at their next highest valuation: item 3 (value = 90).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value = 86).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 has high valuations from Agent 0 (84) and Agent 1 (65). We should give it to Agent 0 since Agent 1 already has item 3.
- Item 4 has a high valuation from Agent 2 (69).
- Item 5 is best valued by Agent 1 (36).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
