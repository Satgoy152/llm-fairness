Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  29  31  56  57  94
1   1  12  95  72  44  53
2  42   7  98   8  91  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42  7 98  8 91 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. This type of allocation problem is often approached using concepts from fair division and combinatorial optimization.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 51.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 29.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.

By assigning items based on the highest valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their individual valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
