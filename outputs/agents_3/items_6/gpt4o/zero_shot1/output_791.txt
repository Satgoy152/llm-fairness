Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  84  79  40  24   4
1  78  63  46  95  86   4
2  31  45  72  33  49  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 45 72 33 49 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can use a simple heuristic to accomplish this: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 2
   - Agent 1 values it at 78
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 63
   - Agent 2 values it at 45
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 72
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 95
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 24
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Agent 2 values it at 49
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 96
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, we present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
``` 

Each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations, with each item assigned to the agent who values it the most.
