Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  36  73  35  46  78
1  87  65  97  87  26  50
2  71  16  64  48  87  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 36 73 35 46 78]
 [87 65 97 87 26 50]
 [71 16 64 48 87 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

First, let's examine each agent's valuations:

- Agent 0: [35, 36, 73, 35, 46, 78]
- Agent 1: [87, 65, 97, 87, 26, 50]
- Agent 2: [71, 16, 64, 48, 87, 38]

We can use a method that attempts to maximize total satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (97).
2. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (87).
3. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (78).
4. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (87).
5. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (87), but since Agent 1 already has 2 items, we give it to the next highest valuation, which is Agent 2 (48).
6. **Item 1**: Highest remaining valuation by Agent 1 (65), but Agent 1 already has 2 items, so it goes to the next highest, Agent 0 (36).

This allocation ensures that each agent's preferences are considered, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4, 3]
}
```
