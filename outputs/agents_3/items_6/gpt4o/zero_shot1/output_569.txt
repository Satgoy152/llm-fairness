Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  67  28  90   4  28
1  69  45  72  47   4  70
2  85  37  25  71  66  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 67 28 90  4 28]
 [69 45 72 47  4 70]
 [85 37 25 71 66 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives as close as possible to an equal number of items. Given there are 6 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 2 items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Choose items with high valuations: Item 3 (value 90) and Item 1 (value 67).
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 90 + 67 = 157.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Choose items with high valuations: Item 2 (value 72) and Item 5 (value 70).
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 72 + 70 = 142.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Choose items with high valuations: Item 0 (value 85) and Item 4 (value 66).
   - Total valuation for Agent 2: 85 + 66 = 151.

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items, and the allocations are made in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
