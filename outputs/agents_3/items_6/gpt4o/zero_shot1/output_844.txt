Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  26  71  28  65  87
1  47  56  45  33  88  98
2  25  73  32  30  38  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 73 32 30 38 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We can use a method that seeks to maximize the total utility or minimize envy among agents. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 62 + 26 + 71 + 28 + 65 + 87 = 339
   - Agent 1: 47 + 56 + 45 + 33 + 88 + 98 = 367
   - Agent 2: 25 + 73 + 32 + 30 + 38 + 29 = 227

2. Allocate items by comparing the relative values agents assign to each item and ensuring a fair distribution.

3. Try to ensure each agent gets at least one high-value item from their perspective.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 (value 62) and 5 (value 87) for a total value of 149.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 (value 56), 4 (value 88), for a total value of 144.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 (value 32) and 3 (value 30) for a total value of 62.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
