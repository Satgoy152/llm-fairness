Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  66  63  94  75  57
1  45   9  20  23  29  44
2  42  71   6  23  19  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 66 63 94 75 57]
 [45  9 20 23 29 44]
 [42 71  6 23 19 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and devise a strategy to allocate the items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [19, 66, 63, 94, 75, 57]
- Agent 1: [45, 9, 20, 23, 29, 44]
- Agent 2: [42, 71, 6, 23, 19, 56]

Given these values, we can allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value received by each agent:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value (94) for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 because it has the highest value (71) for Agent 2.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it has the second-highest value (75) for Agent 0.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 because it has the second-highest value (56) for Agent 2.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because it has the highest value (45) for Agent 1.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because it has the third-highest value (63) for Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets 3 items, Agent 1 gets 1 item, and Agent 2 gets 2 items, while maximizing the values based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
