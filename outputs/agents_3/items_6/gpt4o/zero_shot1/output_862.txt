Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  82  73  57  45  26
1   6  75  58  95  22  18
2  93  93  70  15  19  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 75 58 95 22 18]
 [93 93 70 15 19 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a greedy approach to allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it highest at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest at 93.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest at 73.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it highest at 95.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 45.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest at 95.

Based on the above valuations, we can attempt a fair allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
6. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
