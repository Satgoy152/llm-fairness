Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  44  71  15   2  15
1  80  42  94  74  55  63
2  69  29  58  91  28  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 44 71 15  2 15]
 [80 42 94 74 55 63]
 [69 29 58 91 28 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
-----------|-----------------------
    0      | 71  44  71  15   2  15
    1      | 80  42  94  74  55  63
    2      | 69  29  58  91  28  59
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 94). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 91). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 80). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 44). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 63). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 2). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some items, and the total number of items allocated is 6. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
