Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  30  60  44  86  96
1   2   8  91   5  28  59
2  64   9  83  97  58  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2  8 91  5 28 59]
 [64  9 83 97 58 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One approach is to iteratively assign the highest-valued item for each agent, then adjust to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

Agent 0: [21, 30, 60, 44, 86, 96]
Agent 1: [2, 8, 91, 5, 28, 59]
Agent 2: [64, 9, 83, 97, 58, 55]

We can initially assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 96), item 2 to agent 1 (value 91), and item 3 to agent 2 (value 97).

Now the allocations are:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3]

Next, we assign the remaining items, considering the second-highest valuations:

2. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 86) because agent 0 values it the most among remaining items.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 64) because agent 2 values it the most among remaining items.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 30) because agent 0 values it the most among remaining items.

Now the allocations are:
- Agent 0: [5, 4, 1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3, 0]

This distribution ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent. All 6 items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
