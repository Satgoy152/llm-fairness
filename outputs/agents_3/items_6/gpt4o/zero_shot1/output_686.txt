Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  23   4  50  31  25
1  28  78  28   6  54  59
2  38  44  55  45  26  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that balances the total valuation sum each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation to determine a balanced distribution of value.
2. Assign items to agents in such a way that attempts to equalize the total value received by each agent as much as possible.

Let's work through these steps:

### Agent 0:
- The highest value items for Agent 0 are item 3 (50), item 4 (31), and item 0 (25).

### Agent 1:
- The highest value items for Agent 1 are item 1 (78), item 5 (59), and item 4 (54).

### Agent 2:
- The highest value items for Agent 2 are item 5 (72), item 2 (55), and item 1 (44).

To balance the allocation:
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because it is the highest value for them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it is the highest value for them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 because it is the highest value for them.

Now, allocate the remaining items based on remaining valuations and to ensure each agent gets two items if possible:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because it has a high value for them and balances their total.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 to balance their total.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 to balance their total.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives items that they value highly.
