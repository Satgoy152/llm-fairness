Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  95   2  23  15  25
1  36  46   3  48  36  51
2  47  97  17  95  52  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the table you provided, let's consider each agent's preferences and distribute items accordingly. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items:** 
   - Item 1 (95)
   - Item 0 (35)

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items:** 
   - Item 5 (51)
   - Item 3 (48)

3. **Agent 2's highest valued items:** 
   - Item 3 (95)
   - Item 1 (97)
   - Item 0 (47)

Now let's allocate the items, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for any item by any agent)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (second highest value by Agent 2)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest value)

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest remaining value for Agent 1)

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0)

This allocation gives each agent their highest remaining value items after considering the highest overall values.

Here is the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, respects their valuations, and all 6 items are allocated.
