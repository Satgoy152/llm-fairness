Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  14  83  54  87  15
1  29  86   4  10  68   5
2   2  19  40  51   4  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among 3 agents based on their valuations and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can follow an approach that maximizes the total satisfaction based on their respective values.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Highest Valuation Prioritization**:
   - First, identify the highest value each agent has for any item.
   - Allocate the item with the highest valuation to the corresponding agent.

2. **Subsequent Allocations**:
   - Continue assigning the remaining items by selecting the highest available valuation for any agent.

**Allocation Steps**:
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 87).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 86).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 51).

Now, allocate the remaining items:
- The next highest valuation is for Agent 0 for item 2 (value 83).
- Next, Agent 0 for item 3 (value 54), but item 3 is already allocated to Agent 2.
- Next, Agent 1 for item 4 (value 68), but item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0.
- Next, Agent 0 for item 0 (value 60).
- Next, Agent 2 for item 5 (value 23).

Now all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on maximizing their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
