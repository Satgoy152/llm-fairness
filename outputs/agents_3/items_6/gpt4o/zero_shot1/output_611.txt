Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  74  58  96  53  14
1  72  67   8  49  47   1
2   4  43  99  30  78  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 67  8 49 47  1]
 [ 4 43 99 30 78 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the valuation matrix and allocate the items:

Valuation Matrix:
```
Agent\Item   0   1   2   3   4   5
0           30  74  58  96  53  14
1           72  67   8  49  47   1
2            4  43  99  30  78  12
```

We want to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is fair. Let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Item 3 is the highest-valued item for Agent 0 with a value of 96.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Item 0 is the highest-valued item for Agent 1 with a value of 72.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Item 2 is the highest-valued item for Agent 2 with a value of 99.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

- **Items Remaining:** 1, 4, 5

The remaining items should be allocated to ensure a fair distribution, considering the overall valuations and attempting to balance the total value:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 3. 
  - Allocate item 1 (74 value) to maximize the total value for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:** Already has item 0.
  - Allocate item 4 (47 value) to reasonably balance Agent 1's total value.

- **Agent 2:** Already has item 2.
  - Allocate item 5 (12 value) as it is the remaining item.

Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is balanced based on their values.
