Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  35  88  75  58  30
1  19  15  77  38  70  34
2  51  75  44  13  70  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 15 77 38 70 34]
 [51 75 44 13 70 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction based on the given valuations. We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a reasonable amount of value, considering the preferences indicated by their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [86, 35, 88, 75, 58, 30]
Agent 1: [19, 15, 77, 38, 70, 34]
Agent 2: [51, 75, 44, 13, 70, 40]
```

We will proceed by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 2 (88), 0 (86), and 3 (75).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 4 (70), 2 (77), and 3 (38).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 1 (75), 4 (70), and 0 (51).

Now, let's make allocations while ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent:

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 86).
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2 (value 75).
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 77).
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 75).
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2 (value 70).
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 34).

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute high-valued items based on agents' preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair share in terms of value.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are distributed among the three agents.
