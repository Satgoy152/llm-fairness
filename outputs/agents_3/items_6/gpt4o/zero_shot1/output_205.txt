Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  19  71  49  14  26
1   5  60  33  71  11  12
2  58   3   9   2  98  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt to allocate items as fairly as possible:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 3 and significant value for item 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 very highly and has some value for item 0.

Given these observations, one possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 61 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 60 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 71 for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 71 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 98 for Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 10 for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation is relatively fair based on the valuations.

The resulting allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
