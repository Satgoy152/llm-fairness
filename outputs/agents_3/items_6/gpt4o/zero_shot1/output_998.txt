Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  31  39  92  13   3
1  13  10  12  74  70  68
2  96  10  87  44  83  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 10 12 74 70 68]
 [96 10 87 44 83 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, keeping in mind that each agent should get an integer number of items and only 6 items are available in total.

Let's consider allocating items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (92), Item 0 (62), Item 2 (39)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (74), Item 4 (70), Item 5 (68)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (96), Item 2 (87), Item 4 (83)

Allocating based on the highest valuations and trying to ensure fairness, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 3 (total value = 62 + 92 = 154)
- **Agent 1** gets items 4 and 5 (total value = 70 + 68 = 138)
- **Agent 2** gets items 1 and 2 (total value = 10 + 87 = 97)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of allocated items is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
