Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   2  97  42  37  77
1  64  45  61  86  13  29
2  53  19  50  70  87  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73  2 97 42 37 77]
 [64 45 61 86 13 29]
 [53 19 50 70 87 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [73, 2, 97, 42, 37, 77]
- Agent 1: [64, 45, 61, 86, 13, 29]
- Agent 2: [53, 19, 50, 70, 87, 13]

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Allocate the highest valued items first:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 with 97.
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 2 with 87.
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 1 with 86.

2. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 has items 2 and needs more items. The next highest for Agent 0 is item 5 with a value of 77.
   - Agent 1 has item 3 and needs more items. The next highest for Agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 64.
   - Agent 2 has item 4 and needs more items. The next highest for Agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 19.

3. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items [3, 0]
   - Agent 2: Items [4, 1]

Each agent receives two items, and all six items are allocated.

**Final Allocations:**
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
