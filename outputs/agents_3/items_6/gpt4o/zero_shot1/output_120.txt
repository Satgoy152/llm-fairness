Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  40  94  32  33  76
1  50  35  28  68  12  67
2  68  82  42  54  87  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 94.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 68.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 96.

2. Now, we will allocate the remaining items by considering the highest remaining values across agents for each item, ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

   - Items 0 and 1 can be assigned to Agent 2, as they have the highest values for these items (68 and 82, respectively).
   - Item 4 can go to Agent 2 because it has the highest value for this item (87).
   - Finally, assign any unallocated items to Agent 0 (e.g., item 1).

After ensuring each agent gets at least one item and respecting the fairness criteria, the allocation can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has received items according to their highest valuations, while distributing all items fairly.
