Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  82  15  53  82  95
1  53  23  58   8  57  62
2  18  94  59  58  80  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [18 94 59 58 80 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all six items are distributed among the agents. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on the given valuations.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method like the "maximum sum of valuations" approach, where we assign items to agents based on maximizing their total valuation.

Let's break down the item allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (95), 0 (87), 4 (82)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (58), 5 (62), 0 (53)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (94), 4 (80), 5 (76)

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 87)
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 94)
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 58)
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 53)
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 80)
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 62)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least two items and is reasonably fair based on the valuation table.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
