Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  36  63  32  71  88
1  89  85   3  23  21  23
2  62   5  39  28  45  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A common approach is to use a method like "round-robin" or "greedy allocation" based on the highest value given by the agents to the items.

Here, I will allocate the items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (Value 88)
   - Second highest value item: Item 4 (Value 71)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (Value 89)
   - Second highest value item: Item 1 (Value 85)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (Value 39)
   - Second highest value item: Item 3 (Value 28)

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and the allocation is based on the highest valuations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 6 items to the agents, ensuring each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuation preferences.
