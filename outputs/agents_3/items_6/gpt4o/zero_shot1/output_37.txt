Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  52  25  20  68  98
1  24  51   5  13  70  17
2  77   5  13  68  59   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 52 25 20 68 98]
 [24 51  5 13 70 17]
 [77  5 13 68 59  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives. We will also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

We start by examining the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate items to agents to maximize their valuation while ensuring fairness.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 5: Value = 98
   - Item 4: Value = 68
   - Item 0: Value = 33

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 4: Value = 70
   - Item 1: Value = 51
   - Item 0: Value = 24

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 0: Value = 77
   - Item 3: Value = 68
   - Item 4: Value = 59

We will try to allocate the items based on the highest valuations and ensure fairness among agents.

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 98).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 70).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 68).

Now, we have 3 items allocated and 3 remaining.

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 77).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation of 52 for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation of 25).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 5].
- Agent 1 receives item [4].
- Agent 2 receives items [0, 3].

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
