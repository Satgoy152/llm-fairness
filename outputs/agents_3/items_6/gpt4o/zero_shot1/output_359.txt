Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  32   1  15  39  50
1  91  12   8  35  32  58
2  31  26  67  76   1  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that reflects these preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 23
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 15
  - Item 4: 39
  - Item 5: 50

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 35
  - Item 4: 32
  - Item 5: 58

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 76
  - Item 4: 1
  - Item 5: 20

We can aim to allocate the highest-valued items to each agent based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (91), so give item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (50), so give item 5 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (76), so give item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 0 values item 4 next highest (39), so give item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 2 values item 2 next highest (67), so give item 2 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 1 values item 1 next highest (12), so give item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
