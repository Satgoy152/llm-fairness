Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  73  49  97  54  23
1  77  66  29  36   5   1
2  38  37  72  55  30   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - Agent 2 values it at 38.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Agent 1 values it at 66.
   - Agent 2 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 29.
   - Agent 2 values it at 72.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Agent 2 values it at 55.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 54.
   - Agent 1 values it at 5.
   - Agent 2 values it at 30.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Agent 2 values it at 9.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. Agent 1 currently has none, so let's make some adjustments:

- Reallocate **Item 4** from Agent 0 to Agent 1. Agent 0 will still have items 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Reallocate **Item 2** from Agent 2 to Agent 2, but this remains as is since Agent 2 already has it.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
