Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  86  51  22  50  46
1  93  91   6  63  29  47
2   6  61  32   8  22  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 91  6 63 29 47]
 [ 6 61 32  8 22 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest value items: 1 (86), 2 (51), 0 (35)
- Agent 1:
  - Highest value items: 0 (93), 1 (91), 3 (63)
- Agent 2:
  - Highest value items: 5 (68), 1 (61), 2 (32)

We'll try to give each agent their highest possible value items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (93), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1 (86), so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (68), so we assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Now, let's allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 4) in a way that maximizes the remaining total value:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (51), so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (63), so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (29), so we assign item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item while maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
