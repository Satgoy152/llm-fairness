Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  82  19  93  52  77
1  75  23  25  75  31  21
2  64  76  32  91  98  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[48 82 19 93 52 77]
 [75 23 25 75 31 21]
 [64 76 32 91 98 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 75, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 82, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 32, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 93, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 96, which is the highest.

Based on this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed.
