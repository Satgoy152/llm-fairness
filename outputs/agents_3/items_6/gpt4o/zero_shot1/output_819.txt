Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  41  36  92  91  81
1   7  40  20  83  79  18
2   1  53  52  39  78  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Let's assess how to allocate the items based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [48, 41, 36, 92, 91, 81]
   - Highest valued items: 3 (92), 4 (91), 5 (81)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [7, 40, 20, 83, 79, 18]
   - Highest valued items: 3 (83), 4 (79), 1 (40)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [1, 53, 52, 39, 78, 37]
   - Highest valued items: 1 (53), 2 (52), 4 (78)

To ensure fairness, we can aim to give each agent their top-valued items as much as possible while ensuring that all 6 items are allocated.

**Allocation Plan:**

- **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values item 3 and 4 the most, and given those items have high valuations, we can allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values item 5 more than Agent 2 does, and Agent 0 already received two high-value items.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 2, as these are among the higher values for Agent 2.

Now, we've allocated 5 items: 3 and 4 to Agent 0, 5 to Agent 1, and 1 and 2 to Agent 2.

The remaining item, item 0, has the highest valuation for Agent 0. However, to balance the allocation and give each agent at least one item, we can consider the next highest valuation among Agents 1 and 2 for item 0:

- Agent 1 values item 0 at 7.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 1.

Thus, it makes more sense to give item 0 to Agent 1 to ensure all agents get an item, and Agent 1 gets another item to balance the allocation.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.
