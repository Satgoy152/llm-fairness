Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  71  30  92  18  67
1  58  98  23  98  24  99
2  14  29  78  70  60  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [14 29 78 70 60 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each gets approximately an equal share of the items. Here is one possible allocation:

Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 0.  
Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 5.  
Agent 2 has high valuation for item 2 and decent valuations for item 4.

Here's how the allocation could look:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

This allocation gives each agent two items and respects individual preferences based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
