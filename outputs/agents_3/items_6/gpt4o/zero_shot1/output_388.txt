Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  16  33  56  70  63
1  80  88  24   7  65  35
2  32   7  75  35  64   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 88 24  7 65 35]
 [32  7 75 35 64  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of each item by the agents and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible). Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Has a high valuation for item 0 (98), which is the highest among all agents for any item.
   - Also has a significant valuation for item 4 (70).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Has a high valuation for item 1 (88), which is the highest for this item.
   - Item 5 is valued at 35 by Agent 1, which is reasonable compared to other options.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Has a high valuation for item 2 (75), which is the highest among all agents for this item.
   - Can take item 3, valued at 35.

Now, we assign the items based on these valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 2:** Items [2, 3]

This allocation maximizes each agent's benefit based on their valuations. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are allocated with each agent receiving items that maximize their respective valuations.
