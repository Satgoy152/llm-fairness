Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  82  75  34   7  94
1  36  69  22  89   2  78
2  17  35  67  19  31  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [17 35 67 19 31 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, given there are 6 items and 3 agents. We'll try to distribute the items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (94), Item 1 (82), Item 2 (75)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (89), Item 1 (69), Item 5 (78)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (67), Item 1 (35), Item 4 (31)

Now, let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets an item:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Assign Item 5 (highest value 94)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Assign Item 3 (highest value 89)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Assign Item 2 (highest value 67)

Now each agent has at least one item. Next, we allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 4

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Assign Item 1 (82)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Assign Item 0 (36)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Assign Item 4 (31)

This distribution ensures a fair allocation based on the highest preferences possible, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
