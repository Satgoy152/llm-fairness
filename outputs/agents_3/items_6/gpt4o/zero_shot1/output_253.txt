Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  51  76  40  79  18
1  31  64  96   2   1  84
2  83  77  37   9   3  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 64 96  2  1 84]
 [83 77 37  9  3 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. One common approach to this problem is to use an optimization-based method such as the Hungarian algorithm, but for simplicity, we will manually allocate items by considering the highest valuations first.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Start with the highest value item for Agent 0, which is item 4 valued at 79. Next, consider item 2 valued at 76.

2. **Agent 1**: Start with the highest value item for Agent 1, which is item 2 valued at 96, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so we choose the next highest, which is item 5 valued at 84. Then, consider item 1 valued at 64.

3. **Agent 2**: Start with the highest value item for Agent 2, which is item 0 valued at 83. Next, consider item 1 valued at 77, but it's taken by Agent 1, so choose the next highest available, which is item 2, but it's taken by Agent 0, so select item 3 valued at 9.

After considering these, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4, 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 5, 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 0, 3

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
