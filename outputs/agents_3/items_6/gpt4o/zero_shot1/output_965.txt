Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88   4  41  60  33  18
1   5  13  33  98  79  93
2  28  27   4  61   5  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 13 33 98 79 93]
 [28 27  4 61  5 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest values to each agent, ensuring each receives an integer number of items.
2. Adjust allocations to balance fairness if necessary.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (88), followed by item 3 (60).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (98), followed by item 5 (93).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (71), followed by item 3 (61).

Given these preferences, we can follow these steps for allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it at 88, which is the highest among all agents for this item).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it at 98, which is the highest for item 3).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (agent 2 values it at 71, the highest for item 5).
4. Consider the remaining items: 1, 2, and 4.

- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (agent 0 values it at 41, higher than other agents).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it at 79, higher than other agents).
- Assign item 1 to agent 2 (agent 2 values it at 27, higher than other agents).

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items fairly based on the provided valuations, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable total value from their allocated items.
