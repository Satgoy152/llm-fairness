Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  28   5  17  39  49
1  88  46  67  35  83  52
2  40  41  53  23   6  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. **Item Valuation Review**:
   - Agent 0 values: [67, 28, 5, 17, 39, 49]
   - Agent 1 values: [88, 46, 67, 35, 83, 52]
   - Agent 2 values: [40, 41, 53, 23, 6, 74]

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to the agent who has the highest valuation for them.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (88)
   - Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (46)
   - Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (67)
   - Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (35)
   - Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (83)
   - Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (74)

4. **Review Allocation for Fairness**:
   - Agent 1 has received too many items, so redistribute for balance.
   - Reallocate considering fairness, enabling each agent to receive at least one item where possible.

5. **Final Fair Allocation**:
   - Reassign items to balance the distribution and cover the constraint of integer distribution.

After balancing and ensuring the allocation is fair while maximizing valuation for each agent, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations and keeps the total number of allocated items to 6.
