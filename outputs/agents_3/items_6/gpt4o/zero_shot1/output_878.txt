Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  98  92  50  43  18
1  69  70   2  84  14  49
2  29  10  29  57  27  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation each agent receives from the items they get. One way to approach this is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to maximize the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 80
   - Item 1: Value 98

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 84
   - Item 5: Value 49

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value 29
   - Item 4: Value 27

The allocations can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the three agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
