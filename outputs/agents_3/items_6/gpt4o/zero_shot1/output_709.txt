Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  19   7  93  81  74
1  71  64  44  75  34   5
2  76  70  40  57  69  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 19  7 93 81 74]
 [71 64 44 75 34  5]
 [76 70 40 57 69 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0 valuations: [9, 19, 7, 93, 81, 74]
Agent 1 valuations: [71, 64, 44, 75, 34, 5]
Agent 2 valuations: [76, 70, 40, 57, 69, 16]
```

Given there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 and 4 (93 and 81).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 1 (71 and 64).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 5 (40 and 16).

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and the allocations are based on maximizing their utility from their perspectives.

### Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This distribution should fairly and optimally allocate the items based on the given valuations.
