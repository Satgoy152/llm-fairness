Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  94  82  85  65  55
1  42  40   4  81  49  40
2  57  61   3  75   5  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 40  4 81 49 40]
 [57 61  3 75  5 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one possible method to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 81.
2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 94.
3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 82.
4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 81.
5. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 49.
6. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 59.

This allocation ensures each agent is assigned items they value highly. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```
