Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  78  67  20   6  63
1  13  33  26  75  95  87
2  45  69  12  35  97  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 33 26 75 95 87]
 [45 69 12 35 97 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction. Let's examine each agent's preference based on the valuations provided and try to distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [44, 78, 67, 20, 6, 63]
- Agent 1: [13, 33, 26, 75, 95, 87]
- Agent 2: [45, 69, 12, 35, 97, 17]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (78), 2 (67), and 5 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (95), 5 (87), and 3 (75).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (97), 1 (69), and 3 (35).

### Allocation:
- **Item 4**: Valued highest by Agent 2 (97), allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (78), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Valued second highest by Agent 1 (87), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Valued highest by Agent 1 (75), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Valued highest by Agent 0 (44), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Valued second highest by Agent 0 (67), allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2].
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 5].
- Agent 2 gets item [4].

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4]
}
```
