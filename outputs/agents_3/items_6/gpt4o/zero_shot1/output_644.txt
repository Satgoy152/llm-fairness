Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  65  71  81  85   3
1  13  49  57  22  74   1
2  91  80  65  96   4  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We also aim to balance the distribution as evenly as possible across the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [22, 65, 71, 81, 85, 3]
- Agent 1 values: [13, 49, 57, 22, 74, 1]
- Agent 2 values: [91, 80, 65, 96, 4, 82]

One possible approach to fairly allocate the items is:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation for this agent and is the highest compared to other agents.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it has a high valuation for this agent and is the highest compared to other agents.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has a high valuation for this agent and is the highest compared to other agents.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has a high valuation for this agent and is the highest compared to other agents.
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation for this agent and is the highest compared to other agents.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation for this agent and is the highest compared to other agents.

This allocation ensures that we distribute items to agents based on their highest valuation while also ensuring each agent receives an item. The allocation can be represented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on each agent's valuations.
