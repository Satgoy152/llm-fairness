Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  45  55  74  71  99
1  70  22  93  85  16   2
2  87  35  11   0  92  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (where possible) and all items are allocated.

One possible fair allocation is as follows:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item first.
2. Distribute remaining items based on remaining highest valuations.

Let's go through this process:

### Initial Highest Valuations
- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 93)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 92)

### Assign Highest Valued Items
- Agent 0 gets Item 5.
- Agent 1 gets Item 2.
- Agent 2 gets Item 4.

### Remaining Items: 0, 1, 3

### Allocation of Remaining Items
- Agent 0: Highest remaining values for items are 83 (Item 0) and 74 (Item 3).
- Agent 1: Highest remaining values for items are 85 (Item 3) and 70 (Item 0).
- Agent 2: Highest remaining values for items are 87 (Item 0) and 55 (Item 5).

Assign based on highest remaining values:
- Agent 0 gets Item 0 (value 83).
- Agent 1 gets Item 3 (value 85).
- Agent 2 gets Item 1 (value 35).

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items [5, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 1]

### JSON Representation
```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their preferences while all items are distributed fairly.
