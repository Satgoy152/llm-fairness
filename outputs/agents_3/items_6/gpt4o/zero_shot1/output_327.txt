Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  52  30  73   3  49
1  76  68  96  50  31  18
2  17  85  69  14   7  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 85 69 14  7 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness. Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent will receive 2 items.

Let's consider the allocations based on the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 3 (73), Item 1 (52)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 0 (76)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (85), Item 5 (58)

Let's make the allocations ensuring each agent gets 2 items and the total number of items allocated is 6:

- Assign Item 3 and Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 and Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 5 and Item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation takes into account the highest valuations each agent has and ensures each agent receives 2 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```
