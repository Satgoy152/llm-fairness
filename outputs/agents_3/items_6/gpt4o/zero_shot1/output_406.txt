Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85   6  30  13  62  29
1  58  69  58  39  38  57
2  46  55  30  56  38  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85  6 30 13 62 29]
 [58 69 58 39 38 57]
 [46 55 30 56 38 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with a fair allocation:

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [85, 6, 30, 13, 62, 29]
- Agent 1: [58, 69, 58, 39, 38, 57]
- Agent 2: [46, 55, 30, 56, 38, 23]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Each agent should get at least one item.
2. Try to assign the highest valued items to the respective agents.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than necessary unless unavoidable.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 85) and item 4 (value 62)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 69) and item 5 (value 57)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 30) and item 3 (value 56)

### Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 4, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 3, which are their highest valued items.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total satisfaction among all agents is relatively balanced based on their individual valuations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
