Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49   5  53   9  24  77
1  21  96  27  98  62  68
2  75  63  93  90  88  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents, which typically involves giving each agent the items they value most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and only a total of 6 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 49
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 9
- Item 4: 24
- Item 5: 77

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 21
- Item 1: 96
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 98
- Item 4: 62
- Item 5: 68

Agent 2:
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 63
- Item 2: 93
- Item 3: 90
- Item 4: 88
- Item 5: 90

To distribute the items fairly, we will try to assign items in such a way that each agent gets some of their most valued items, while also ensuring that no agent is left without any items unless necessary.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most, so assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Next, assign item 0 to agent 2, who values it second highest.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 1, who values it the second highest.
6. Finally, assign item 4 to agent 2, who has the third highest valuation for it.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
