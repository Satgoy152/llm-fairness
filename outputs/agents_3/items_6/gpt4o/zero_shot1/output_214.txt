Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  12  57   0  69  26
1  26  20  44  73   9  93
2  62  58  10  72  48  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 58 10 72 48 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the highest valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 0
  - Item 4: 69
  - Item 5: 26

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 73
  - Item 4: 9
  - Item 5: 93

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 72
  - Item 4: 48
  - Item 5: 73

Let's assign items to agents by identifying which agent values each item the most:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0: 24
   - Agent 1: 26
   - Agent 2: 62
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 12
   - Agent 1: 20
   - Agent 2: 58
   - Allocate to Agent 2

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 57
   - Agent 1: 44
   - Agent 2: 10
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 0
   - Agent 1: 73
   - Agent 2: 72
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 69
   - Agent 1: 9
   - Agent 2: 48
   - Allocate to Agent 0

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0: 26
   - Agent 1: 93
   - Agent 2: 73
   - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and that each agent receives an integer number of items.
