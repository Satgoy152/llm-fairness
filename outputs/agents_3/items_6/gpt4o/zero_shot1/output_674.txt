Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25   9  19   1  86  94
1  59  43  83  52  69  23
2  21  52  13  67  12   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25  9 19  1 86 94]
 [59 43 83 52 69 23]
 [21 52 13 67 12  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We'll proceed with the following steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their total value, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's examine the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [25, 9, 19, 1, 86, 94]
Agent 1: [59, 43, 83, 52, 69, 23]
Agent 2: [21, 52, 13, 67, 12, 1]
```

Now we will assign items to agents:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Assign remaining items by maximizing the total valuation per agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has highest valuations for items 5 and 4.
- Agent 1 has highest valuations for items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has highest valuations for items 3 and 1.

Using this information, we can allocate as follows:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 94).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 83).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 67).

Now, allocate the remaining items [0, 1, 4]:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 86).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 52).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 59).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, maximizing their valuations while ensuring each item is allocated once.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
