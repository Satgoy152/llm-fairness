Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14   0  45  56  31  33
1  12  69   3  60  50  85
2  64  96  76  20  63  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and attempt to maximize their satisfaction. One approach is to use a method called "Greedy allocation," where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The valuations are [14, 12, 64]. Agent 2 values it the most.
2. **Item 1**: The valuations are [0, 69, 96]. Agent 2 values it the most.
3. **Item 2**: The valuations are [45, 3, 76]. Agent 2 values it the most.
4. **Item 3**: The valuations are [56, 60, 20]. Agent 1 values it the most.
5. **Item 4**: The valuations are [31, 50, 63]. Agent 2 values it the most.
6. **Item 5**: The valuations are [33, 85, 53]. Agent 1 values it the most.

After allocating based on highest valuations, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than necessary if possible:

- Agent 2 currently has items 0, 1, 2, and 4, which is 4 items.
- Agent 1 has items 3 and 5, which is 2 items.
- Agent 0 does not have any items.

To make the allocation fairer, we can consider reallocating one item from Agent 2 to Agent 0:

- Reallocate **Item 0** from Agent 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 2 has the highest valuation for other items as well.

Now the allocation is as follows:

Agent 0: [0]  
Agent 1: [3, 5]  
Agent 2: [1, 2, 4]  

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
