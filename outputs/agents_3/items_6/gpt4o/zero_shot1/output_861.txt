Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  33  77  42  18   7
1   4  21  17  86  55  39
2  24  56  70  87  62  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 21 17 86 55 39]
 [24 56 70 87 62 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

### Valuations Table:
```
       Items
      0   1   2   3   4   5
A0  48  33  77  42  18   7
A1   4  21  17  86  55  39
A2  24  56  70  87  62  78
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are items 2 and 0. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3, but since it's already taken, we assign item 5, which has the second-highest value for Agent 2.

### Remaining Items:
- Items 0, 1, and 4 are still available.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a high value for them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is the next best option for them.
- Finally, assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high valuations according to their preferences, and all items are distributed.
