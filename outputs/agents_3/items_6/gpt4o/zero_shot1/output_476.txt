Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  74  46  28  79  84
1  75  81  36  23  97  69
2  57  46  80  17  28  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the satisfaction or total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items that they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items that they value highly.
- Agent 2 receives items that they value highly.

Let's go through the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 0 with a value of 84.
   - Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0 with a value of 79.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1 with a value of 81.
   - Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1 with a value of 36.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2 with a value of 57.
   - Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 2 with a value of 17.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and all six items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
