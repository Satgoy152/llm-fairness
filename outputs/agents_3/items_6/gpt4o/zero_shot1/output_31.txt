Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  22  87  12  79  76
1  13  35  79  51  16  86
2  39  55  83  41  61   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, taking into account their individual valuations for each item. Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items: [2 (87), 4 (79), 5 (76)]
   - Agent 1 values items: [5 (86), 2 (79), 3 (51)]
   - Agent 2 values items: [2 (83), 1 (55), 4 (61)]

2. **Maximize Total Value:**
   - First, allocate the highest valued items that are unique to each agent.
   - Then, resolve any conflicts for items valued highly by multiple agents.

3. **Initial Allocation Considerations:**
   - Agent 0's highest value is item 2 (87)
   - Agent 1's highest value is item 5 (86)
   - Agent 2's highest value is item 2 (83)

4. **Resolve Conflicts and Allocate Items:**
   - Item 2: Highest value for Agent 0 (87) and Agent 1 (79). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Highest value for Agent 1 (86). Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 2 (55) as the next highest non-conflicting item.

5. **Continue Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 has item 2. Allocate item 4 (79), second-highest for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has item 5. Allocate item 3 (51), second-highest for Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has item 1. Allocate item 0 (39), next highest for Agent 2.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [5, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 0]

This ensures each agent gets valuable items according to their preference.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
