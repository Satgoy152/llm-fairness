Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  61  33  68   9  65
1  74  54  60  92  30  38
2  71  39  40  87  16  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 3 agents and 6 items, ideally, each agent should get 2 items to ensure the distribution is fair in terms of quantity.

Let's allocate the items using a heuristic approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with 2 items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the values provided:

1. Look at item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 21
   - Agent 1 values it at 74 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 71

   Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Look at item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 61 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 39

   Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. Look at item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 33
   - Agent 1 values it at 60 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 40

   Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Look at item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 92 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 87

   Allocate item 3 to Agent 1. However, Agent 1 already has 2 items, so we need to give it to the next highest, which is Agent 2.

5. Look at item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Agent 2 values it at 16 (highest value among agents who have fewer than 2 items)

   Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

6. Look at item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 38
   - Agent 2 values it at 98

   Allocate item 5 to Agent 2. However, Agent 2 already has 2 items, so we give it to the next highest, which is Agent 0.

Now, each agent has 2 items, and the allocation is complete.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
