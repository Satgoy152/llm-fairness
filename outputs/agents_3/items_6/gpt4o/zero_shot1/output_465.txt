Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  44   7  34  98  58
1   3  83  42  23  24  82
2  19  42   2  73   3  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 44  7 34 98 58]
 [ 3 83 42 23 24 82]
 [19 42  2 73  3 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets, while ensuring each agent gets some items. Given the valuations provided in the table, we can evaluate the potential allocations.

Let's make a possible allocation based on maximizing individual values:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Item 4: Value 98 (highest for agent 0)
   - Item 0: Value 62 (second highest for agent 0)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Item 1: Value 83 (highest for agent 1)
   - Item 5: Value 82 (second highest for agent 1)

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Item 3: Value 73 (highest for agent 2)
   - Item 2: Value 2 (only remaining item)

This allocation ensures each agent receives 2 items, and the allocation maximizes the value for each agent given the constraints. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
