Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  40  66  98  59  32
1  34  20  42  58  65  70
2  63  91  35  19  68   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[47 40 66 98 59 32]
 [34 20 42 58 65 70]
 [63 91 35 19 68  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

The valuations table is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [47, 40, 66, 98, 59, 32]
Agent 1: [34, 20, 42, 58, 65, 70]
Agent 2: [63, 91, 35, 19, 68, 9]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 3 (98), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (70), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (91), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Now consider remaining items: 0, 2, 4.
5. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (63), allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 0 values item 2 (66) the most after item 3, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
7. Finally, item 4: Agent 1 values item 4 the most (65), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent has received a fair share of the items based on their preferences. The allocation is complete with each agent receiving two items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
