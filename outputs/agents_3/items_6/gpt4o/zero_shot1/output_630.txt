Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  72  62   9   7  73
1  32  17  41  44  54  96
2  82  97   4  97  35  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 17 41 44 54 96]
 [82 97  4 97 35 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total value received by each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 and 5 (72 and 73 respectively).
   - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 and 4 (96 and 54 respectively), but item 5 is already allocated.
   - Allocate items 4 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1, 3, and 0 (97, 97, and 82 respectively), but items 1 and 3 are already allocated.
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 2.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated and no item is assigned to more than one agent:

- Item 0: Allocated to Agent 2
- Item 1: Allocated to Agent 0
- Item 2: Allocated to Agent 2
- Item 3: Allocated to Agent 1
- Item 4: Allocated to Agent 1
- Item 5: Allocated to Agent 0

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
