Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  42  40  22   5  30
1  56  15  24  86  21   0
2  53  93  58  69  54  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We also ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the total valuation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (valuation 93). Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (valuation 86). Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 1** also has a high valuation for item 0 (valuation 56). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2 (valuation 58). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (valuation 56). Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
6. The remaining item is 4. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (valuation 54). Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuations for the agents while ensuring a fair and complete allocation.
