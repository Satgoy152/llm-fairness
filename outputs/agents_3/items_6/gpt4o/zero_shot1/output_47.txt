Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   2  63  31  58  27
1   4  15  23  85  98  32
2  80  21   3   1  13  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation each agent has for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Here’s one approach to allocate the items:

1. Find the item with the highest value for each agent and try to assign it to them if it doesn't conflict with another agent's high-value item.
2. If conflicts occur, assign the item to the agent who values it the most and then allocate remaining items considering the remaining high valuations or distribute evenly.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valuation items: 2 (63), 4 (58)
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valuation items: 4 (98), 3 (85)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valuation items: 0 (80), 5 (60)

**Resolve Conflicts:**

- Item 4 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 1 due to the highest valuation (98).
- Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2. Assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 3 is then assigned to Agent 1 as it’s the next highest for them.
- Item 5 is assigned to Agent 2 since they value it highly.
- Item 1 can be assigned to Agent 0 as it’s low priority for others.
- Item 2 is assigned to Agent 0 as they have a high value for it.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance between giving each agent their most valued items while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items.
