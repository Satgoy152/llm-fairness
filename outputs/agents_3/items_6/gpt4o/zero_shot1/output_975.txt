Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  13  23  15  81  85
1   9  22  29  40  24  30
2  67  25  31   3   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to account for their valuations, let's try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest valued items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a somewhat even distribution of valuations with a peak at item 3.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 and a decent valuation for item 0.

Let's make allocations based on maximizing the total utility for each agent:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 4 and 5 (highest values for agent 0).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 3 (highest value for agent 1).
- Agent 2: Allocate items 0 and 2 (high values, and item 5 is already allocated to agent 0).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 1 (leftover item with the highest value for agent 1).

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
