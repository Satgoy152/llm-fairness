Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  27  44  32  53  59
1  84  46  37  10   0   1
2  60  65  61  20  30  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 46 37 10  0  1]
 [60 65 61 20 30 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider giving each agent a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring each agent receives items. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

**Step 1: Analyze Valuations**
- Agent 0's highest-valued items: 59 (Item 5), 53 (Items 0 and 4).
- Agent 1's highest-valued items: 84 (Item 0), 46 (Item 1), 37 (Item 2).
- Agent 2's highest-valued items: 65 (Item 1), 64 (Item 5), 61 (Item 2).

**Step 2: Assign Items Based on Valuations**
1. **Assigning Item 0**: It has the highest value for Agent 1 (84), so assign it to Agent 1.
2. **Assigning Item 5**: It has a high value for Agent 0 (59) and Agent 2 (64). Assign it to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has fewer high-value options.
3. **Assigning Item 1**: It has a high value for Agent 2 (65). Assign it to Agent 2.
4. **Assigning Item 2**: It has a good value for Agent 2 (61). Assign it to Agent 2.
5. **Assigning Item 4**: It has a high value for Agent 0 (53). Assign it to Agent 0.
6. **Assigning Item 3**: It has the highest remaining value for Agent 0 (32). Assign it to Agent 0.

**Step 3: Allocations**
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 5

**Step 4: Ensure Fairness and Completeness**
- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 1 item
- Agent 2: 3 items

All 6 items are allocated fairly, considering each agent's highest-valued items.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
