Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  91  24  26  31  15
1  35  89  41  59  78  38
2   7  43  33  62  52  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 43 33 62 52 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and try to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We want to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [18, 91, 24, 26, 31, 15]
- Agent 1: [35, 89, 41, 59, 78, 38]
- Agent 2: [7, 43, 33, 62, 52, 28]

One possible allocation strategy is to maximize the total utility across all agents while trying to distribute items evenly.

Here's a proposed allocation:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value)
- Assign item 0, 4 to Agent 1 (second highest values)
- Assign items 2, 3, 5 to Agent 2 (remaining items and balanced value)

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 5]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
