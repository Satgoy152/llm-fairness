Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  93  32  86  94  67
1  94   0  40  58  64  76
2   8  28  81  84  71  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 93 32 86 94 67]
 [94  0 40 58 64 76]
 [ 8 28 81 84 71 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can do this by considering the highest valuations first and then assigning items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Values: [85, 93, 32, 86, 94, 67]
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 94)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Values: [94, 0, 40, 58, 64, 76]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 94)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Values: [8, 28, 81, 84, 71, 28]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 84)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

Now each agent has one item. We proceed to allocate the remaining items.

4. **Remaining Items:** 1, 2, 5

5. **Item 1:**  
   - Highest value by Agent 0 (value 93)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 2:**  
   - Highest value by Agent 2 (value 81)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

7. **Item 5:**  
   - Highest value by Agent 1 (value 76)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
