Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  16  49  38  71  94
1  28  51  96  60  75  47
2  54  52  33  45  87  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents (0, 1, and 2), we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the items and their values for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [79, 16, 49, 38, 71, 94]
   - Agent 1: [28, 51, 96, 60, 75, 47]
   - Agent 2: [54, 52, 33, 45, 87, 91]

2. **Identify the highest value each agent has for the items:**

   - Agent 0's highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 0 (79)
   - Agent 1's highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 4 (75)
   - Agent 2's highest values: Item 5 (91), Item 4 (87)

3. **Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total value:**

   - Agent 1 should receive Item 2, as it is the highest value for any item at 96.
   - Agent 2 should receive Item 5, as it is their second highest value at 91.
   - Agent 0 should receive Item 0, as it's their second highest value at 79.

4. **Allocate remaining items by considering the next best options:**

   - Agent 1 can take Item 4, as it has a high value for them (75) and is their next best option.
   - Agent 0 can take Item 1 and Item 3, as they provide a reasonable sum of values for Agent 0 compared to other options.

5. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 4
   - Agent 2: Item 5

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
