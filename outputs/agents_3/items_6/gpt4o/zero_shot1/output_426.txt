Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  65  69   8  75  41
1  53  63  77  29  30  54
2  73  23  66   9  43  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for all agents. The goal is to ensure each agent receives items such that the sum of their valuations for those items is as high as possible, while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0 preferences:**
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (94), then item 4 (75), item 2 (69), item 1 (65).

2. **Agent 1 preferences:**
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (77), then item 1 (63), item 5 (54).

3. **Agent 2 preferences:**
   - Highest valuation for item 0 (73), then item 2 (66).

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Highly valued by both Agent 0 (94) and Agent 2 (73), but Agent 0 values it more. Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Highly valued by Agent 0 (65) and Agent 1 (63). Assign to Agent 0, who values it slightly more.
3. **Item 2:** Highly valued by Agent 1 (77) and Agent 2 (66). Assign to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it the most.
4. **Item 3:** Valued by Agent 1 (29) and least by Agent 2 (9), assigned to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** Valued by Agent 0 (75), assigned to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** Valued by Agent 1 (54), assigned to Agent 1.

After allocation, Agent 2 doesn't receive any items. To distribute fairly and ensure each agent has at least one item, we can adjust as follows:

- Reassign item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 2.

Now, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution while maximizing the total valuation for each agent.
