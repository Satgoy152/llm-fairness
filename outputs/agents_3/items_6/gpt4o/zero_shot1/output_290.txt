Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  10  23  21  41  53
1  83  45   1  12  44  74
2  29  41  39  39  64  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 45  1 12 44 74]
 [29 41 39 39 64 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring every agent gets an integer number of items. Below is one such allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 5 most highly (53), followed by item 4 (41). We can give these to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 most highly (83) and item 5 next (74). Since item 5 is already allocated, we give item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 most highly as well (84), but since it's already allocated, we consider the next highest valued items. We can give item 2 (39) and item 3 (39) to agent 2.

Now, items 1 and 4 remain, and we need to assign each of them to an agent:

- Agent 0 values item 1 as 10 and item 4 as 41. Item 4 has already been given to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 as 45, which is the highest remaining unallocated value among the items and agents.
- Item 4 is already allocated to agent 0.

Thus, the allocations can be:

- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
