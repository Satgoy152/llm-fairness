Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  44  69  25  47  86
1  13  66  87  55   2  60
2  93  86  70  53  20  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 86 70 53 20 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a variant of the Hungarian algorithm or to simply allocate the highest valued items for each agent step by step. Here, I'll provide a simple allocation strategy:

Agent 0's valuations: [75, 44, 69, 25, 47, 86]  
Agent 1's valuations: [13, 66, 87, 55, 2, 60]  
Agent 2's valuations: [93, 86, 70, 53, 20, 75]

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 93 for agent 2, highest available).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 87 for agent 1, highest available).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 86 for agent 0, highest available).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 86 for agent 2, next highest available).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 55 for agent 1, next highest available).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 47 for agent 0, next highest available).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable total value from their allocated items. Now, let's format the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This JSON structure indicates that agent 0 receives items 5 and 4, agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, and agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.
