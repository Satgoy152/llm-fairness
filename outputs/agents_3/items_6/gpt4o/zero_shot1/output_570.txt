Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  68  30  63  52  89
1  63  35  35  28   8  23
2  71  40  22  24  51  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 6 items being allocated in total. We'll aim to maximize the total value for all agents while distributing the items as evenly as possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [64, 68, 30, 63, 52, 89]
- Agent 1: [63, 35, 35, 28, 8, 23]
- Agent 2: [71, 40, 22, 24, 51, 78]

To allocate the items, we can use the following approach:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure fairness and maximize total value.

After analyzing the valuations, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation maximizes each agent's total value received from the items:

- Agent 0: 68 (item 1) + 63 (item 3) + 89 (item 5) = 220
- Agent 1: 35 (item 2) = 35
- Agent 2: 71 (item 0) + 51 (item 4) = 122

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
