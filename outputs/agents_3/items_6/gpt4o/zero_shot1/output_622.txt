Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  29  62  28   3  45
1   6  58   1  56  90   3
2  60  14  74   6  48  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 58  1 56 90  3]
 [60 14 74  6 48 92]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, considering the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Let's analyze the data and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Items: [50, 29, 62, 28, 3, 45]
   
2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Items: [6, 58, 1, 56, 90, 3]
   
3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - Items: [60, 14, 74, 6, 48, 92]

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Prioritize items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.
- Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

**Steps:**

1. **Item 0:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (60).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (58).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (74).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (56).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (92).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0 receives no items as their highest valuations were not competitive.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, and 5.

This ensures that each agent receives items they value highly.

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
