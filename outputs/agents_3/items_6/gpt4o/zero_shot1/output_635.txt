Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  42   3  89  40  87
1   3  57  95  17  58  93
2  93  31  47   6  93  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their perceived value based on their individual valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Using this approach, we try to balance the allocations by considering the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 and item 5 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 2 and item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 0 and item 4 highly.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 3 and item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 and item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 and item 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
