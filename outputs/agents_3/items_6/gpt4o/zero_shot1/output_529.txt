Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  96  78  22  13  53
1  94  13  49  96  83  70
2  26  91  10  34  71   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (value) for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's approach this by examining the valuations and assigning items to maximize each agent's total value:

First, let's consider the total value each agent could achieve for all items:

- Agent 0: 18 + 96 + 78 + 22 + 13 + 53 = 280
- Agent 1: 94 + 13 + 49 + 96 + 83 + 70 = 405
- Agent 2: 26 + 91 + 10 + 34 + 71 + 7 = 239

Now, let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value, making sure each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 1 (96)
   - Second highest value: Item 2 (78)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (94)
   - Second highest value: Item 3 (96)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (91)
   - Second highest value: Item 4 (71)

We will assign items to each agent while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0 and second-highest for Agent 2)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Agent 2)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)

This way, each agent gets a fair allocation while maximizing their total satisfaction based on the valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
