Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  37  51  36  65  49
1  32  91  45  31  65  47
2   3   3   7  26   3  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 37 51 36 65 49]
 [32 91 45 31 65 47]
 [ 3  3  7 26  3 55]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 37, 51, 36, 65, 49]
- Agent 1: [32, 91, 45, 31, 65, 47]
- Agent 2: [3, 3, 7, 26, 3, 55]

We can proceed with the allocation by considering both maximizing the value for each agent and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust for fairness and total allocation.

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0** has high values for items 4 and 2.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most, followed by items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 2** values item 5 significantly more than others.

Let's try to distribute these items fairly:

1. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 91) to Agent 1, since it's the highest single valuation.
2. **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (value 65) to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (value 55) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 51) to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (value 32) to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (value 26) to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations

Following the above strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is six.
