Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  61  74  43  82  18
1  23  84  88  49  44  73
2  16  81  39  24   5  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 61 74 43 82 18]
 [23 84 88 49 44 73]
 [16 81 39 24  5 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated to one agent only. One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring each agent gets roughly the same total valuation.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (78) and 4 (82).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 (84) and 2 (88).
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (96).

Beginning the allocation with the highest valuation items for each agent:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, items 3 is left unassigned. We need to allocate it to the agent who would have the highest additional valuation from receiving it, which is Agent 1 (valuation of 49 for item 3).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 2: Item 5

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total valuation is reasonably balanced across the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```
