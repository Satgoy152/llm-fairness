Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  37  28  31   7  10
1  91  20  44  74  30  38
2  30  71  39  89  37  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we should aim to allocate items to agents such that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One method to achieve this is by using an algorithm like the "Envy-Free Algorithm" or simply by inspecting the valuations to ensure that the allocations are as balanced as possible.

Let's start by examining the valuations and attempting to allocate the items:

**Agent 0 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 67
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 28
- Item 3: 31
- Item 4: 7
- Item 5: 10

**Agent 1 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 91
- Item 1: 20
- Item 2: 44
- Item 3: 74
- Item 4: 30
- Item 5: 38

**Agent 2 Valuations:**
- Item 0: 30
- Item 1: 71
- Item 2: 39
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 37
- Item 5: 91

Based on the valuations, we can observe the following potential allocations to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Highest value for Item 0 (67) and Item 1 (37)
  
- **Agent 1:** 
  - Highest value for Item 3 (74), and relatively high for Item 4 (30)
  
- **Agent 2:** 
  - Highest value for Item 5 (91), and relatively high for Item 2 (39)

Now let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Allocate Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items for which they have relatively high valuations, leading to a fair and envy-free allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
