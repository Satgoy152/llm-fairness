Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36   4  13  87  60  95
1  15  58  57  88  57  26
2   2  39  82  29   0  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. This involves considering the valuations of the items by each agent and distributing them to balance the total value each agent receives. One common method to achieve this is the "envy-free" allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

| Item/Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 36 | 15 | 2  |
| 1          | 4  | 58 | 39 |
| 2          | 13 | 57 | 82 |
| 3          | 87 | 88 | 29 |
| 4          | 60 | 57 | 0  |
| 5          | 95 | 26 | 27 |

We aim to distribute the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is roughly balanced. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values Item 5 the highest (95), compared to the other agents.
2. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest (88), compared to the other agents.
3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values Item 2 the highest (82), compared to the other agents.
4. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for Item 4 (60), after considering the other agents.
5. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (58).
6. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 has the lowest valuation for all items, but by this point, allocating Item 0 here helps balance the total perceived value.

This allocation attempts to balance the total values perceived by each agent. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```
