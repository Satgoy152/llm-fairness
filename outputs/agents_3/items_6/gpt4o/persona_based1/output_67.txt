Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  28  49  76  36  94
1  86  88  88  65  67  35
2  19  54  62  77  88  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Additionally, each agent should receive an integer number of items. Given the constraints and the valuations, let's attempt to find an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's evaluate the valuations and aim to assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their total perceived value while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, since we have 3 agents and 6 items. This should help in minimizing potential envy.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 0 (94). 
   - Item 3 has the second-highest value (76).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 (88).
   - Item 2 also has the same value as Item 1 for Agent 1 (88).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 2 (88).
   - Item 0 is the next choice with significant value (19).

By following this allocation, each agent gets items they highly value, reducing potential envy between agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, thereby using all 6 items, and is designed to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
