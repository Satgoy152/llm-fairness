Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  49  44  40  18   8
1  66  30  54  48  22   6
2  62  28  38  91  96  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 30 54 48 22  6]
 [62 28 38 91 96 77]]
Output:
To allocate items to the agents in a fair manner, aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what any other agent receives, based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (76).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (66), but has the second-highest value for item 2 (54).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (96).

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since it has the highest value for it.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for it.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since it is their second-highest valued item after item 0 which is already taken by Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 1, 3, and 5.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (91), so assign it to them.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (30) more than the other remaining items, so assign it to them.
   - Agent 2 also values item 5 (77), so assign it to them.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [2, 1]
   - Agent 2: [4, 3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, potentially minimizing envy.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4, 3, 5]
}
```
