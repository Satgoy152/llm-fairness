Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  24  24  26  53  14
1  47  89  31  12  81   6
2   4  26  48  91  74   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, according to their valuations. Here's how we can approach the problem:

First, let's outline the agents and their valuations for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [9, 24, 24, 26, 53, 14]
- Agent 1's valuations: [47, 89, 31, 12, 81, 6]
- Agent 2's valuations: [4, 26, 48, 91, 74, 3]

Given that we have 3 agents and 6 items, each agent should ideally get 2 items. However, due to the disparity in valuations, the goal is to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing individual satisfaction while minimizing envy:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them if possible:
   - Agent 0's highest valued item is item 4 (value 53).
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is item 1 (value 89).
   - Agent 2's highest valued item is item 3 (value 91).

2. Allocate these items:
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 3 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 2, 5) in a way that continues to minimize envy:

3. Consider the next highest valuations for each unallocated item:
   - Item 0 is valued 47 by Agent 1.
   - Item 2 is valued 48 by Agent 2.
   - Item 5 is valued 14 by Agent 0.

4. Allocate based on these valuations:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, each agent receives 2 items, and we've attempted to minimize envy by allocating items based on their highest remaining values for each agent.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 2]
}
```
