Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  77   2  76   0  46
1  79  32  69  34  64  67
2  42  35  68  62  93  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations. Envy-freeness implies that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, given their personal valuations.

Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0: \(10 + 77 + 2 + 76 + 0 + 46 = 211\)
   - Agent 1: \(79 + 32 + 69 + 34 + 64 + 67 = 345\)
   - Agent 2: \(42 + 35 + 68 + 62 + 93 + 26 = 326\)

2. **Fair Share Calculation**: Divide each agent's total valuation by the number of items to find their "fair share" per item.
   - Fair share for each agent (all agents have 6 items): 
     - Agent 0: \( \frac{211}{6} \approx 35.17\)
     - Agent 1: \( \frac{345}{6} \approx 57.5\)
     - Agent 2: \( \frac{326}{6} \approx 54.33\)

3. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items by starting with the highest valued items for each agent until all items are allocated, trying to match their fair share.

4. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust allocations if necessary to reduce any potential envy.

Here is a potential allocation based on these principles:

- **Agent 0**: Values items 1 and 3 highly, so we allocate those.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly and moderately values items 4 and 5.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly, followed by item 2 and item 3.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items that together approximate their fair share, based on their own valuations, while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.
