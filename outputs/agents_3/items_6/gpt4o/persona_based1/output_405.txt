Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  73  66  22  41  69
1  71  46  50  31  31  90
2  74  85   0  14  73  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. One approach to achieve this is to ensure that each agent receives items with a total value that is as close as possible to the maximum value they could have obtained, had they been able to choose any items freely. 

Let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0: \(28 + 73 + 66 + 22 + 41 + 69 = 299\)
- Agent 1: \(71 + 46 + 50 + 31 + 31 + 90 = 319\)
- Agent 2: \(74 + 85 + 0 + 14 + 73 + 61 = 307\)

Now, we'll try to allocate items to maximize fairness. A possible approach is to follow these steps:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Continue allocating remaining items so that the total value each agent receives is balanced.

Considering this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (73) and item 5 second most (69).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (90) and item 0 second most (71).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (85) and item 4 second most (73).

Let's try an allocation and adjust to minimize envy:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 85 for Agent 2).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 90 for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 71 for Agent 1).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 73 for Agent 2).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 66 for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 22 for Agent 0).

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3 with a total value of 66 + 22 = 88.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5 with a total value of 71 + 90 = 161.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4 with a total value of 85 + 73 = 158.

This allocation attempts to make the distribution fairly balanced given the constraints. The total values are relatively close, minimizing the potential for envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
