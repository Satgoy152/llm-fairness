Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  57  49  60  69  57
1  88  50  82  18  23  51
2  37  92  13   2  36  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 92 13  2 36 64]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their valuations, I will attempt to achieve an envy-free distribution. This means that each agent should feel that their allocated items are at least as valuable as the items allocated to any other agent.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  57  49  60  69  57
1  88  50  82  18  23  51
2  37  92  13   2  36  64
```

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can consider maximizing the minimum value each agent perceives in their allocation. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the most, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 1 values it the most (82), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
  
- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values it the most (60), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
  
- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 2 values it the most (64), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and assigns all items in a way that respects their highest preferences. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This distribution attempts to be envy-free by respecting each agent's highest valued items while distributing the remaining items in a fair manner.
