Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  81  96  12  96  67
1  95  96  87   3  62   8
2   8  85  48  49  88  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims to be fair and envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items. Here's one potential way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that they value highly and are not as highly valued by other agents.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, prioritize items they value highly relative to other agents.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items, trying to maximize their value.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 96
  - Item 5: 67

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 3
  - Item 4: 62
  - Item 5: 8

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 48
  - Item 3: 49
  - Item 4: 88
  - Item 5: 18

Now we can proceed with an allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value for Agent 1 (95), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 1 (96), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value for Agent 0 (96), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 2 (49), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highest value for Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 96 and 88, respectively. Allocate to Agent 0 for overall fairness since they have fewer items.
- **Item 5**: Highest value for Agent 0 (67), so allocate to Agent 0.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 2, 4, and 5; Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1; Agent 2 receives item 3. This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their relative valuations.
