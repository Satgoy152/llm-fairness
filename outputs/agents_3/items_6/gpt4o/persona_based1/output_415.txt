Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  46  49  69  28  35
1  55   8  42   5  73  65
2  19  39  75  35  57  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 46 49 69 28 35]
 [55  8 42  5 73 65]
 [19 39 75 35 57 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible based on the provided valuations. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share of the items according to their preferences.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(77 + 46 + 49 + 69 + 28 + 35 = 304\)
- Agent 1: \(55 + 8 + 42 + 5 + 73 + 65 = 248\)
- Agent 2: \(19 + 39 + 75 + 35 + 57 + 70 = 295\)

Next, let's try to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair portion of their total valuation. We will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items they value highly.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highly values item 0 (77) and item 3 (69).
   - We allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highly values item 4 (73) and item 5 (65).
   - We allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highly values item 2 (75) and has moderate interest in item 1 (39).
   - We allocate items 2 and 1 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives high-value items from their perspective, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
