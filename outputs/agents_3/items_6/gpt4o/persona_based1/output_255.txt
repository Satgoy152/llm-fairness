Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  56  83  61  15  83
1  95  55  14   0  68  96
2  38  90  38  20   2  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can approach this problem by considering the valuations each agent has for the items and trying to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 2, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0, 5, and 4.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1, 2, and 3.

We want to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while minimizing the total envy.

Given this, a possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2, which have high valuations (76 and 83, respectively).
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 4, which have high valuations (96 and 68, respectively).
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 3, which have high valuations (90 and 20, respectively).

This allocation ensures each agent receives some of the items they value most, and every item is allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
