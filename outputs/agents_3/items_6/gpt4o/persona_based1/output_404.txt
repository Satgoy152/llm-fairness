Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  36  58  15  93  70
1  97  54  76  38  84  80
2  10  64  30  73  52  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can employ a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This involves having the agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool of items until all items are allocated. This method aims to minimize envy by allowing each agent to choose based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Determine which agent values the highest item and let them pick first.
2. Continue in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (value 97, highest value among all).
2. **Agent 0** picks item 4 (value 93, highest remaining for them).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 5 (value 97, highest remaining for them).
4. **Agent 1** picks item 2 (value 76, next highest for them).
5. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 36, next highest for them).
6. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 73, only item remaining).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while ensuring each receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.
