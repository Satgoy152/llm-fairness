Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  43  22  36  87  62
1  26  42  94  11  87  57
2  15  62  57  95  11  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible, considering that each agent has different valuations for the items. We want to allocate each item to the agent that values it the most, thereby minimizing envy. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 88.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 62.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agents 0 and 1 both value it at 87. 
   - To maintain balance and considering previous allocations, assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 64.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, and 5.

This allocation is designed to ensure that agents receive items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
