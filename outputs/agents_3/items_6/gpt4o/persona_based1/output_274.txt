Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  30  29  61  63   8
1  92  22  17  58  23  73
2  26  99  87  97  26  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 30 29 61 63  8]
 [92 22 17 58 23 73]
 [26 99 87 97 26 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share, minimizing envy.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [69, 30, 29, 61, 63, 8]
- Agent 1: [92, 22, 17, 58, 23, 73]
- Agent 2: [26, 99, 87, 97, 26, 48]

We will try to find an allocation where each agent receives items they value highly.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (69)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (63)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (92), but already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 5 (73)
   - Second next: Item 3 (58)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (99)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (97), but already taken by Agent 1
   - Next highest: Item 2 (87)

### Allocating the Items

- **Agent 0**: We allocate items 0 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: We allocate items 3 and 5.
- **Agent 2**: We allocate items 1 and 2.

### Verification

Each agent receives their highest possible valued items among the available options, minimizing envy among the agents.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
