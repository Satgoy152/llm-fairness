Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  96   7  24   9  26
1  96  76  64  80  32  36
2  74  14  67   1  81  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim for each agent to receive a set of items that maximizes their perceived value, while minimizing the likelihood of envying another agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we need to carefully consider how each item is valued by each agent to find a fair distribution.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 1 and 0, with valuations of 96 and 73, respectively. Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 places high value on items 0 and 3, with valuations of 96 and 80, respectively. However, since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1. We can also give Agent 1 item 5, which they value at 36, as it is relatively higher than other agents' valuations for this item.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 4 the most at 81. We allocate item 4 to Agent 2. Additionally, Agent 2 values item 2 at 67, which is a high valuation compared to others. We can assign item 2 to Agent 2 as well.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, reducing the likelihood of envy and achieving a fair division based on the given valuations.
