Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  13  91  92  42  55
1  28   3  35  91  55  87
2  52   3  87  78  44  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for an envy-free allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility each agent receives, ensuring that no agent feels envious of another’s allocation.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly at: 2 (91), 3 (92).
- Agent 1 values items highly at: 3 (91), 5 (87).
- Agent 2 values items highly at: 5 (92), 2 (87).

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent maximizes their perceived value of the items they receive, and no agent feels envious of another. One approach is to assign each agent items that they value highly, while ensuring that the allocation is balanced across all agents.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 because they value it very highly (92).
2. Allocate item 5 to agent 2 because they value it very highly (92).
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 because it’s their second-highest valued item (35), and item 3 has already been allocated.
4. Allocate item 4 to agent 1 because it's their next highest valued available item (55).
5. Allocate item 0 to agent 2 because it adds significant value to their allocation (52).
6. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 to balance the allocation and because it adds to their utility (13).

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items and attempts to balance the distribution to avoid envy.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 3] 
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
