Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  38  66  93  35  35
1  73  48  89  64  31  98
2  93  56  21  47  17  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure or maximum Nash welfare allocation. Here, I'll attempt to provide an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives at least one item. 

Given the valuations, let's try to balance the total value each agent receives:

Agent 0's valuations: [59, 38, 66, 93, 35, 35]
Agent 1's valuations: [73, 48, 89, 64, 31, 98]
Agent 2's valuations: [93, 56, 21, 47, 17, 81]

1. Initially, assign each agent their highest valued item to ensure everyone gets something valuable:

   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 93)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 98)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 93)

This leaves items 1, 2, and 4 unallocated.

2. Now, allocate the remaining items to balance the total valuation.

   - For item 1: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 38
     - Agent 1 values it at 48
     - Agent 2 values it at 56

   Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value).

   - For item 2:
     - Agent 0 values it at 66
     - Agent 1 values it at 89
     - Agent 2 values it at 21

   Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value).

   - For item 4:
     - Agent 0 values it at 35
     - Agent 1 values it at 31
     - Agent 2 values it at 17

   Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value).

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 1

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
