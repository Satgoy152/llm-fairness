Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  96  95  59  60  18
1  91  26  72  52  89  37
2  95  66  67  20  52  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 26 72 52 89 37]
 [95 66 67 20 52 65]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. An envy-free allocation would mean that each agent values their assigned items at least as much as any other agent's assigned items.

Let's evaluate some potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 0, 4, and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 0, 1, and 2.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 0 (91), which no other agent values more than 95. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 1 (96). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 0** also has the highest value for item 2 (95). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has a relatively high value for item 4 (89). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 2** has a high value for item 5 (65), which is higher than what agent 1 values it. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
6. **Agent 1** values item 3 at 52, which is higher compared to agent 0's valuation of 59 and agent 2's valuation of 20. Assign item 3 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 2, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing their individual satisfaction while minimizing envy.
