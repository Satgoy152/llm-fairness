Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  90  75  41  72  11
1  75  57  66  39   4  56
2  52  86  17   2  93  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 90 75 41 72 11]
 [75 57 66 39  4 56]
 [52 86 17  2 93 85]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. The valuations matrix is as follows:

```
      0   1   2   3   4   5
0    78  90  75  41  72  11
1    75  57  66  39   4  56
2    52  86  17   2  93  85
```

To proceed, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share.

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: [78, 90, 75, 41, 72, 11]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**: [75, 57, 66, 39,  4, 56]
3. **Agent 2's Valuations**: [52, 86, 17,  2, 93, 85]

### Allocation Strategy:
- Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences, ensuring no envy arises.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Assign Item 1** to Agent 0 (valued highest by Agent 0 at 90).
2. **Assign Item 4** to Agent 2 (valued highest by Agent 2 at 93).
3. **Assign Item 0** to Agent 0 (valued highly by Agent 0 at 78).
4. **Assign Item 5** to Agent 2 (valued highly by Agent 2 at 85).
5. **Assign Item 2** to Agent 1 (valued at 66, second highest available for Agent 1).
6. **Assign Item 3** to Agent 1 (remaining item, valued at 39 by Agent 1).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]

This allocation considers the highest preference each agent has for available items and attempts to ensure no agent would prefer another's allocation over their own.

{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
