Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  86   7  23  41  71
1  21   9  84  11   9   6
2  52  61  83  44   9  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items, which can help achieve a fair and envy-free allocation. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **List all items and their valuations for each agent.**
2. **Attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed.**
3. **Check for potential envy situations and adjust if necessary.**

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- **Agent 0 (valuations):** [73, 86, 7, 23, 41, 71]
- **Agent 1 (valuations):** [21, 9, 84, 11, 9, 6]
- **Agent 2 (valuations):** [52, 61, 83, 44, 9, 56]

**Allocation strategy:**
- Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 highly values items 2 and 5.

Based on this, we can try the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 1] (valuations = 73 + 86 = 159)
- **Agent 1:** [2, 4] (valuations = 84 + 9 = 93)
- **Agent 2:** [3, 5] (valuations = 44 + 56 = 100)

Now let's check if each agent is satisfied:
- Agent 0 has the highest valued items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 2, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 2 gets item 5, which is one of their highly valued.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation of their items and reduce potential envy. Because each agent receives items they value highly, this can be considered a fair allocation under these circumstances.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
