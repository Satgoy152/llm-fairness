Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  85  73  67  56  30
1  51  59  99  15  86  73
2  62  76  29  30  44  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 76 29 30 44 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure the allocation is envy-free or at least minimizes envy, depending on the feasibility. Here, we consider the valuations each agent has for the items, and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as being the best or equivalent to others.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [48, 85, 73, 67, 56, 30]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [51, 59, 99, 15, 86, 73]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [62, 76, 29, 30, 44, 52]

A potential allocation strategy could involve giving each agent their most valued items, ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 6. We will attempt to balance the allocation while considering the highest valued items for each agent.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Value:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (85)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (99)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (62)

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 3, 4, 5

   At this point, each agent has one item. Next, we allocate the remaining items to ensure fairness and minimize envy.

3. **Review Remaining Items Based on Highest Values:**
   - Agent 0's next highest preference: Item 2 (already allocated), Item 3 (67)
   - Agent 1's next highest preference: Item 4 (86)
   - Agent 2's next highest preference: Item 1 (76, already allocated), Item 5 (52)

4. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0: Gets Item 3 (67)
   - Agent 1: Gets Item 4 (86)
   - Agent 2: Gets Item 5 (52)

This allocation gives each agent two items, and it's based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This configuration attempts to minimize envy and distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.
