Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  21  16  58   5  99
1   5  76  49  93  18  29
2  54  26  40  58   1  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a combination of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring no agent envies another. Given that each agent has different valuations for each item, we should aim to distribute items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (99), followed by item 3 (58). Giving these items to agent 0 maximizes their total valuation.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (93), but since it is already allocated to agent 0, we give them items 1 (76) and 2 (49), which are the next highest valued items.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Agent 2 can be allocated item 0 (54), item 4 (1), and item 5 (68). However, item 5 is already taken by agent 0, so they can be given item 4 as a leftover. 

Revisiting the allocation, we can adjust to ensure all items are allocated and the total number of items equals 6:

- Allocate items with the highest value to each agent, ensuring they do not envy another's allocation.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 5]
- **Agent 1:** [1, 2]
- **Agent 2:** [3, 4]

With this allocation, each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing potential envy among agents.

The final JSON allocation is:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
