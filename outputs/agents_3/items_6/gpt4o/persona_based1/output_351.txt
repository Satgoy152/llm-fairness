Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  73  57  26  48  65
1   2  19  95  29  55  45
2  59   7   7  83  98  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 73 57 26 48 65]
 [ 2 19 95 29 55 45]
 [59  7  7 83 98 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of items received by another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [77, 73, 57, 26, 48, 65]
- Agent 1: [2, 19, 95, 29, 55, 45]
- Agent 2: [59, 7, 7, 83, 98, 62]

We will use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items, taking turns in selecting items in a way that respects their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** values items 0, 1, and 5 highly. We will try to assign these to Agent 0, but ensure no agent is envious.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most. Therefore, item 2 should be given to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 3 and 4. We should prioritize these for Agent 2.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 5, as they are among the highest values for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2, as it is the highest valued for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 3 and 4, as these are highly valued by Agent 2.

Finally, allocate item 1 to Agent 0 to balance the number of items among the agents since this maintains a fair distribution and respects the valuations.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among their highest preferences, thus striving for envy-freeness.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, which are highly valued by them.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, which is their top preference.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 4, and 5, which match their high valuations.

This allocation aims to balance the item distribution while respecting each agent's preferences to the greatest extent possible within the constraints given.
