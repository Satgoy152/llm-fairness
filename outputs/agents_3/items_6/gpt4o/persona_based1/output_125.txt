Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  59  30  11  24  47
1  90  42  34  19  36  81
2  10  21  25  64  37  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[20 59 30 11 24 47]
 [90 42 34 19 36 81]
 [10 21 25 64 37 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items, we consider the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. With 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure fair division.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0: 20 + 59 + 30 + 11 + 24 + 47 = 191
- Agent 1: 90 + 42 + 34 + 19 + 36 + 81 = 302
- Agent 2: 10 + 21 + 25 + 64 + 37 + 22 = 179

Now, let's proceed with the allocation by ensuring that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their happiness while maintaining envy-freeness among them. We will try to assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's highest values**: 
   - Item 1 (59)
   - Item 5 (47)

2. **Agent 1's highest values**:
   - Item 0 (90)
   - Item 5 (81) — Already allocated to Agent 0, so choose next highest value:
   - Item 4 (36)

3. **Agent 2's highest values**:
   - Item 3 (64)
   - Item 4 (37) — Already allocated to Agent 1, so choose next highest value:
   - Item 2 (25)

Given these choices, we ensure each agent gets 2 items and no agent envies another:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
