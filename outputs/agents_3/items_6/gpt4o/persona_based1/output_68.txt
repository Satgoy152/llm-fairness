Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  69  25  47   4  85
1   5  78  90  26  13  90
2  54  72  52  91  30  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we want to allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents in such a way that the allocation is fair and possibly envy-free. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities that each agent receives. This often results in a fair allocation.

Let's start by listing out the items each agent values the most, which can help us make a more informed decision:

- Agent 0 values item 5 at 85 the most.
- Agent 1 values items 2 and 5 both at 90 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 91 the most.

Given these valuations, let's try to allocate items to maximize fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest, and no other agent values item 3 as highly as Agent 2 does. Therefore, we assign item 3 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 1** has the highest value on items 2 and 5. To minimize envy, we should give one of these high-value items to Agent 1. Let's give item 2 to Agent 1, as this is one of the highest valued by them and not highly valued by the others.

3. **Agent 0** highly values item 5, which is also highly valued by Agent 1. However, since Agent 1 already has item 2, we can give item 5 to Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. For item 0, Agent 2 has a decent value of 54, which is higher than the others, so we can assign item 0 to Agent 2.

5. For item 1, Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 72, so it makes sense to give item 1 to Agent 2.

6. Finally, item 4 has relatively low values across the board, with Agent 2 having a slightly higher value at 30. However, to ensure Agent 0 has more than one item, we can allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 3

Checking the number of items, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
