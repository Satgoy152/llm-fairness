Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  84  44  99  16  39
1  46  10  48  16  46  23
2  34  64  55  76  11  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we'll consider the agents' valuations of each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their share to be at least as valuable as the other agents' shares.

We'll use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a similar heuristic to attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation. Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations**:  
   Items in decreasing order of value: 3 (99), 1 (84), 2 (44), 0 (43), 5 (39), 4 (16)

2. **Agent 1's valuations**:  
   Items in decreasing order of value: 0 (46), 2 (48), 4 (46), 5 (23), 3 (16), 1 (10)

3. **Agent 2's valuations**:  
   Items in decreasing order of value: 3 (76), 5 (63), 1 (64), 2 (55), 0 (34), 4 (11)

### Allocation Strategy:
- Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, but ensure each agent receives at least one item to balance their total perceived value.

### Initial Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (99)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (46)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (63)

### Remaining Items:
- Items 0, 1, 2

### Further Allocation:
- **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most among remaining, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values Item 1 the most among remaining, allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** receives Item 2, the only remaining item.

### Final Allocation:
Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.  
Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.  
Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
