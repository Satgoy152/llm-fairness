Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  16  14  72  89   3
1  36  78  58  14   7   3
2  53  74  88  72  36  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 16 14 72 89  3]
 [36 78 58 14  7  3]
 [53 74 88 72 36 82]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations, ideally achieving an allocation that is envy-free or as close to it as possible.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [27, 16, 14, 72, 89, 3]
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (Value: 89)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [36, 78, 58, 14, 7, 3]
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (Value: 78)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [53, 74, 88, 72, 36, 82]
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (Value: 88)

This initial assignment of the highest-valued items gives:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2

**Remaining Items: 0, 3, 5**

**Re-evaluate Remaining Items:**

1. **Agent 0's next highest preference:**
   - Item 3 (Value: 72)

2. **Agent 1's next highest preference:**
   - Item 0 (Value: 36)

3. **Agent 2's next highest preference:**
   - Item 5 (Value: 82)

Allocating based on next highest preferences:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 5

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [4, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming to minimize envy.

**Final JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
