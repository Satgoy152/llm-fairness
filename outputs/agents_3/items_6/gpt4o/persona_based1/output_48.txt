Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  96   3  96  63  36
1  52  93  62  55  40  98
2  96  74  87  50  81  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 96  3 96 63 36]
 [52 93 62 55 40 98]
 [96 74 87 50 81 96]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to achieve fairness and minimize envy is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or the "Maximum Nash Welfare" criterion. However, given the constraints and the need for a quick allocation, we'll use a simple approach to balance the allocations based on the given valuations.

### Valuations Table:
```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  96   3  96  63  36
1  52  93  62  55  40  98
2  96  74  87  50  81  96
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify Highest Valuation for each Item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This reduces envy since each agent receives items they value highly.
2. **Ensure each Agent gets at least one Item**: Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, based on their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (96) -> Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (96) -> Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most (87) -> Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (96) -> Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most (81) -> Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (98) -> Assign to Agent 1.

### Adjustments for Fairness:
Currently, Agent 1 has only one item, while Agent 0 and Agent 2 have multiple items. To balance this, we can reassign some items to ensure a fair distribution. 

Re-evaluate to balance:
- Agent 0 has items [1, 3]
- Agent 1 has items [5]
- Agent 2 has items [0, 2, 4]

Since Agent 1 has only one item, we can consider if we can reassign any item to increase their allocation without significantly reducing the valuation for other agents.

### Final Allocation:
```
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and it balances the number of items each agent receives as evenly as possible.
