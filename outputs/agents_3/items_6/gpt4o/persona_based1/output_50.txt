Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  92  50  78  31  18
1  65  33  43  89  53  13
2  37  29  94  68  79  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 92 50 78 31 18]
 [65 33 43 89 53 13]
 [37 29 94 68 79 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to achieve a fair division, ideally minimizing envy among them. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [89, 92, 50, 78, 31, 18]
- Agent 1: [65, 33, 43, 89, 53, 13]
- Agent 2: [37, 29, 94, 68, 79, 81]

Let's aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets the most valuable items according to their own valuation. 

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1** values items 3 and 0 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 and 5 highly.

We can try a Greedy Allocation approach to achieve a fair division:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since 89 is the highest value for them.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since 92 is the highest value for them.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since 94 is the highest value for them.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since 89 is the highest value for them.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since 79 is the highest value for them.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 since 81 is the highest value for them.

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation allows each agent to receive their highest valued items wherever possible, which should minimize envy and provide a fair division of items.
