Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  41  67   3  14  86
1  20  33  67  68  66  47
2  34  77  78  98  39  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's, given their own valuations. Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, we can allocate 2 items to each agent.

Here is one way to allocate the items to achieve a reasonable balance:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 5 (86)
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest remaining valuations: Item 3 (68), Item 2 (67)
   - Allocate items 3 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations for remaining items: Item 1 (77), Item 4 (39)
   - Allocate items 1 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
