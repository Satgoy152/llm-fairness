Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  28  70  32  49  90
1  76  11  93  68  21  24
2  23  29  10  86  99  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 28 70 32 49 90]
 [76 11 93 68 21 24]
 [23 29 10 86 99 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent given their own preferences.

First, let's list the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [99, 28, 70, 32, 49, 90]
- Agent 1: [76, 11, 93, 68, 21, 24]
- Agent 2: [23, 29, 10, 86, 99, 63]

We will consider an allocation strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach for fair division is to allocate items starting with the highest valuation per agent until all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 0 (99) and item 5 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 2 (93) and item 3 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 4 (99).

Now, let's assign the remaining items considering the least overall impact on preferences:

- **Remaining Items**: 1
- **Agent 2** has a moderate valuation for item 1 (29), which is higher than any other agent's remaining valuations for unclaimed items.

### Final Allocation

Based on the above steps, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their preferences while keeping the distribution as fair as possible.
