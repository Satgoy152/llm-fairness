Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  24  57  93   5  58
1  94  47  22  25  90  91
2   1  21  86  12  86  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1 21 86 12 86 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective. Given the table of valuations:

```
     0   1   2   3   4   5
0   80  24  57  93   5  58
1   94  47  22  25  90  91
2    1  21  86  12  86  83
```

We'll use a method that approximately maximizes the perceived value for each agent. One simple way is to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, since there are as many items as agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Valuations: Agent 0: 80, Agent 1: 94, Agent 2: 1
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Valuations: Agent 0: 24, Agent 1: 47, Agent 2: 21
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Valuations: Agent 0: 57, Agent 1: 22, Agent 2: 86
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest valuation).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Valuations: Agent 0: 93, Agent 1: 25, Agent 2: 12
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Valuations: Agent 0: 5, Agent 1: 90, Agent 2: 86
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Valuations: Agent 0: 58, Agent 1: 91, Agent 2: 83
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation).

### Resulting Allocation:

Agent 1, having received too many items, needs to redistribute to satisfy the condition that each agent receives at least one item.

- Move Item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 now has 2 items, Agent 1 has 3).
- Move Item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 now has 2 items, Agent 1 has 2).

This ensures each agent receives at least two items, and the total count of items remains 6.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize the total perceived value for each agent, given the constraints.
