Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  74  29  13  99  84
1  24   0  35  23  85  33
2  41  71  10  50  40  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 74 29 13 99 84]
 [24  0 35 23 85 33]
 [41 71 10 50 40 95]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider strategies for fair division such as maximizing the total valuation across all agents and ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [93, 74, 29, 13, 99, 84]
- Agent 1 values: [24, 0, 35, 23, 85, 33]
- Agent 2 values: [41, 71, 10, 50, 40, 95]

One approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation of items they receive while trying to balance the distribution fairly.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 4 (99) and item 0 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 4 (85) and item 2 (35).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 5 (95) and item 1 (71).

### Allocation Steps:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 for a high valuation.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as they have the second highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, given their highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 for a reasonable valuation.

### Final Allocations:

The allocation based on the above considerations is:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 5]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
