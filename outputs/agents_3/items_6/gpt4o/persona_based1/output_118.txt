Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  79  90  44  37  39
1  89  35  31  86  39  63
2  49  10  72  57   8   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that respects some fairness criteria, such as envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own. Below is one possible allocation that takes into account the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values for items: 65, 79, 90, 44, 37, 39
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Items 2 (90), 1 (79), and 0 (65)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values for items: 89, 35, 31, 86, 39, 63
   - Highest value items for Agent 1: Items 0 (89), 3 (86), and 5 (63)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values for items: 49, 10, 72, 57, 8, 3
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: Items 2 (72), 3 (57), and 0 (49)

Given the constraints and the need to allocate all 6 items, a possible allocation could be:

- Assign Items [0, 1] to Agent 0
- Assign Items [3, 5] to Agent 1
- Assign Items [2, 4] to Agent 2

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent has a reasonable share according to their highest-valued items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
