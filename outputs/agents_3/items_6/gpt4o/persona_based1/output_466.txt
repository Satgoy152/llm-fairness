Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  56  83  94  56  75
1   2   5  54  67  59  61
2  71   8  74  28  73  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [71  8 74 28 73 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation:** Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for the items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This approach is a heuristic to achieve envy-freeness where possible.

3. **Balance Allocation:** Make sure each agent gets an equal or near-equal number of items if possible, while respecting their valuations.

Let's calculate and allocate the items:

### Step 1: Total Valuation
- Agent 0: 90 + 56 + 83 + 94 + 56 + 75 = 454
- Agent 1: 2 + 5 + 54 + 67 + 59 + 61 = 248
- Agent 2: 71 + 8 + 74 + 28 + 73 + 32 = 286

### Step 2: Allocate Items
1. **Item 3:** Highest value for Agent 0 (94), allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0:** Highest value for Agent 0 (90), allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Highest value for Agent 0 (83), allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 4:** Next highest value for Agent 2 (73), allocate to Agent 2.
5. **Item 5:** Next highest value for Agent 1 (61), allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 1:** Next highest value for Agent 0 (56), since Agent 0 already has 3 items, we should consider balancing:
   - Allocate to Agent 2 (8), as Agent 2 needs more items.

### Step 3: Final Allocation
- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [1, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, while aiming to maximize their total perceived value of the items they receive. Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
