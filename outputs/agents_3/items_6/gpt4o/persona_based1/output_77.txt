Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51   6  22  91  52  44
1  95  36  11  27  61  82
2  49   2  64  43  91  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51  6 22 91 52 44]
 [95 36 11 27 61 82]
 [49  2 64 43 91 23]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 95.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 6.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with 64.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 91.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 91.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most with 82.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Verify the Allocation:**
   - Each agent should receive at least one item, and all items should be allocated.
   - Agent 0: [1, 3]
   - Agent 1: [0, 5]
   - Agent 2: [2, 4]

4. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - Each agent gets items based on their highest valuations to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items in a manner that maximizes their perceived value, based on the given valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
