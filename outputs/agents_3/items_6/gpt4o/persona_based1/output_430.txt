Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  28  79  87  50  74
1  89  54  46  70  97  39
2  76  74  28  10  23  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, and no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's first examine the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0: 45 
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 87
  - Item 4: 50
  - Item 5: 74
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 97
  - Item 5: 39
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 10
  - Item 4: 23
  - Item 5: 59

Now, let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign items that Agent 0 values highly and try to avoid conflicts with other agents' high-value items. 
   - Assign: Item 2 (79), Item 3 (87)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Assign items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Assign: Item 0 (89), Item 4 (97)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items that Agent 2 values highly and try to avoid conflicts with other agents' high-value items.
   - Assign: Item 1 (74), Item 5 (59)

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items that they value highly and attempts to minimize envy among agents, considering the given valuations.
