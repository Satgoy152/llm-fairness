Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  22  59  48  81   9
1  46  72  77   3  10  98
2  95  92  93  33  67  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 22 59 48 81  9]
 [46 72 77  3 10 98]
 [95 92 93 33 67 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocation at least as highly as any other agent's allocation. We can use a heuristic approach to attempt to achieve a fair allocation given the valuations matrix:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  22  59  48  81   9
1  46  72  77   3  10  98
2  95  92  93  33  67  62
```

One method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This might not always produce an envy-free allocation, but it gives a starting point for analysis:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 95 by agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 92 by agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 93 by agent 2.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 48 by agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 81 by agent 0.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 98 by agent 1.

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2

Let's check the allocations and see if they can be adjusted to reduce envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4 with a total valuation of 48 + 81 = 129.
- Agent 1 receives item 5 with a total valuation of 98.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 1, and 2 with a total valuation of 95 + 92 + 93 = 280.

Re-evaluate or swap items to improve fairness:

Since Agent 1 values item 5 the highest and Agent 2 has a significantly higher total value, we can attempt to balance the allocations by ensuring each agent's total valuation is closer. This might involve reallocating items with high total values fairly without creating significant envy.

After considering potential swaps and allocations to balance the individual valuations, let's try a different allocation strategy that attempts a more balanced approach:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 because they value it the highest.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because their valuation is second highest after Agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as their valuation is the highest.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as their valuation is the highest.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as their valuation is the highest.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1

Convert this allocation to the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the items based on the initial highest valuations while trying to ensure some level of fairness in distribution.
