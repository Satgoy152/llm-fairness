Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  59  59  61  41  78
1  94  97   6   0  37   7
2  47  99  19  55  13  59
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 99 19 55 13 59]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division with respect to the given valuations, we aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

Let's examine the valuations and try to find an allocation that is as fair as possible:

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: [43, 59, 59, 61, 41, 78]
- **Agent 1**: [94, 97, 6, 0, 37, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [47, 99, 19, 55, 13, 59]

### Strategy for Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent** to prioritize their allocation.
2. **Check for overlaps** where multiple agents highly value the same item and resolve these based on maximizing overall fairness.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (97), which is also highly valued by Agent 2 (99). To minimize envy, allocate item 1 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 has the highest value for it.
  
2. **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (78), which is not highly valued by others. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly (94), and it is not the highest value for others. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 0** and **Agent 2** both have significant values for item 3, but Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 2** values item 2 significantly more compared to others. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

6. **Agent 1** values item 4 (37) more than the others. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2]

This allocation aims to minimize envy by assigning items based on each agent's highest relative valuations.
