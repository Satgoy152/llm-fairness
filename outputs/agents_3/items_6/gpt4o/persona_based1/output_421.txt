Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  88  29  99  64   4
1  36  68   0  41  25  14
2  91  88  98  98  87  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 88 29 99 64  4]
 [36 68  0 41 25 14]
 [91 88 98 98 87 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they received as much value as any other agent based on their own valuations. Given the table of valuations, we will attempt to assign items to agents such that the sum of values for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

### Valuation Table:
```
Agent \ Item | 0   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5
------------------------------------------------
Agent 0      | 8   | 88 | 29 | 99 | 64 | 4
Agent 1      | 36  | 68 | 0  | 41 | 25 | 14
Agent 2      | 91  | 88 | 98 | 98 | 87 | 50
```

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for most items. We can start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent to maximize their utility. This helps in reducing envy:
   - Allocate Item 2 (value 98) to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 3 (value 99) to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 (value 68) to Agent 1.

2. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left are: 0, 4, 5.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items Strategically**:
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 highly (value 91). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Item 4 has a value of 64 for Agent 0, which is the highest for them among the remaining items. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - The only remaining item, 5, will be allocated to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives Items 0 and 2.

These allocations attempt to maximize each agent's perceived value based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### JSON Format Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
