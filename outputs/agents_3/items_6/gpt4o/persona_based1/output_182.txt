Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  75  36  91  59  51
1  62  68  79  62  64  71
2  30  16  12  51  34  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for a distribution where each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. A common approach is to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive, ensuring that the allocations are as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 1 has relatively balanced valuations across most items, with a notably high value for item 2.
- Agent 2 generally has lower valuations, but the highest for item 3 compared to other items.

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: To maximize their total value, we can allocate items with the highest valuations for them. These are items 3 and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Their highest value is for item 2 and a reasonably high value for item 5. We can allocate these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The remaining items, 0 and 4, can be allocated to Agent 2, as their valuations are relatively balanced across these items.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This distribution aims to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy.

Now, formatted in the requested JSON structure:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
