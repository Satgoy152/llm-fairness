Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  95  94  25  34  34
1  18  53  72  47  57  84
2  69  23  68  51  15  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness among the three agents, we can use the Max-Min Fairness approach. This involves ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their minimum happiness, given the limitations of integer allocations.

Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** 50, 95, 94, 25, 34, 34
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** 18, 53, 72, 47, 57, 84
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** 69, 23, 68, 51, 15, 77

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate high-value items first:**
    - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (95), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
    - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (84), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
    - Agent 2 values item 0 highly (69), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance the valuations:**
    - Remaining items are 2, 3, and 4.
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 94).
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (value 51).
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 57).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a share that reflects their preferences and tries to balance the overall happiness.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes potential envy between agents.
