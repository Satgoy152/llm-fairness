Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  88  22  14  23  89
1  63  85  92  65  98  38
2  37  57  91  34  46  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 88 22 14 23 89]
 [63 85 92 65 98 38]
 [37 57 91 34 46 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 88, 22, 14, 23, 89]
- Agent 1: [63, 85, 92, 65, 98, 38]
- Agent 2: [37, 57, 91, 34, 46, 28]

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. **Identify each agent's highest valued items**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (89).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (91).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute remaining items considering overall balance**:

- Remaining items: [0, 1, 3]

   - Item 1 is valued highly by Agent 0 (88) and Agent 1 (85), and moderately by Agent 2 (57). To balance, allocate item 1 to Agent 0, who has the lowest total value so far.
   - Item 0 is valued moderately across all agents, but Agent 1 currently has the least. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 is valued moderately by all and can be given to Agent 2 to balance their total value.

The allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5] (Values: 88, 89)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4] (Values: 63, 98)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3] (Values: 91, 34)

This distribution attempts to balance the total values perceived by each agent and tries to achieve as much envy-freeness as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
