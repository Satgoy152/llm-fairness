Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74   3   0  61   1  80
1  25  54  13  94   3   7
2  67  31  18  90  40  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 31 18 90 40 47]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we want to allocate items in such a way that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to distribute the items to the agents. 

The valuation table is as follows:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 74     | 3      | 0      | 61     | 1      | 80     |
| 1     | 25     | 54     | 13     | 94     | 3      | 7      |
| 2     | 67     | 31     | 18     | 90     | 40     | 47     |

To start, we can allocate items based on each agent's highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 80 for item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 94 for item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 90 for item 3, but it's already taken. Next highest is 67 for item 0.

After this initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: item 5
- Agent 1: item 3
- Agent 2: item 0

Remaining items: 1, 2, 4

Next, we continue allocating remaining items based on the next highest values:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is 74 for item 0, but it's taken. Highest remaining is 61 for item 3, taken. Then 3 for item 1, which is free.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest remaining is 54 for item 1, but it's taken. Then 13 for item 2, which is free.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest remaining is 40 for item 4, which is free.

After these allocations, we have:
- Agent 0: items 5, 1
- Agent 1: items 3, 2
- Agent 2: items 0, 4

All items are now allocated. Each agent has at least one item. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
