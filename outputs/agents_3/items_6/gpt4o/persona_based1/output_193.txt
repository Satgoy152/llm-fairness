Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  12  74  43  63  49
1  44   9  25  66  47  97
2  31  34   7  96  90   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we want to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. One common approach is to use the method of "sequential allocation" or "round-robin" for dividing items based on preferences.

First, let's assess the strategy for allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the highest (74) and item 4 the second highest (63).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 5 the highest (97) and item 3 the second highest (66).
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 3 the highest (96) and item 4 the second highest (90).

In a round-robin approach, each agent takes turns picking their highest-valued item available:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 74).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 97).
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 96).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 63).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 44).
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 34).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has 2 items. Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 0
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 1

The allocation is as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation respects the principle of fairness by considering each agent's preferences as much as possible.
