Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  45   3   3  44  20
1  47  58  58  49  90  87
2  24  18  80  93  26   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll look at the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible, and ideally, no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [79, 45, 3, 3, 44, 20]
- Agent 1's valuations: [47, 58, 58, 49, 90, 87]
- Agent 2's valuations: [24, 18, 80, 93, 26, 3]

We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most. Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most. Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

Now allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations:

4. Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 2 and 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 1 (as it has a higher valuation for agent 1).
5. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
6. Item 1 is valued more by agent 0 than agent 2. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

### Final Allocation
Following the above strategy, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences and attempts to minimize envy among them.
