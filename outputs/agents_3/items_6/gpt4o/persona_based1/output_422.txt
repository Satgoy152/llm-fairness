Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  33  51  90  64  65
1  92  94  53  54  49  26
2  88  61  76   3  41   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 94 53 54 49 26]
 [88 61 76  3 41  9]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can consider the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach helps ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  33  51  90  64  65
1  92  94  53  54  49  26
2  88  61  76   3  41   9
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by looking at the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate those items to the respective agents if no conflicts arise.
2. **Consider Maximum Minimum Fairness:** Ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their minimum gain or at least gets an item they value reasonably.

### Steps:
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1. Allocate these to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 has reasonable values for items 2 and 5, which are not highly valued by others. Allocate items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.
- Item 4 is left. Agent 0 values it more than Agent 2, so allocate it to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value significantly, minimizing envy. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
