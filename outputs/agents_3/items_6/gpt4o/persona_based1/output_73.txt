Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  13  95  82  71  71
1  32  28  87  74  65  22
2  40  15  52  94  21  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 13 95 82 71 71]
 [32 28 87 74 65 22]
 [40 15 52 94 21 14]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy by trying to achieve an envy-free allocation. This involves considering the valuations each agent has for the items and distributing the items in a way that each agent values their assigned items at least as much as the items assigned to others.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [32, 13, 95, 82, 71, 71]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [32, 28, 87, 74, 65, 22]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [40, 15, 52, 94, 21, 14]

A useful approach is to allocate high-valued items according to each agent's preference, while ensuring that no agent feels they are worse off compared to others. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (95)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (82)
   - Third highest: Items 4 and 5 (both 71)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (87)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (74)
   - Third highest: Item 4 (65)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (94)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (52)
   - Third highest: Item 0 (40)

To balance these preferences and allocate all 6 items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 2 and 4. These are among the highest valued for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 1 and 3. Item 3 is highly valued and item 1 is moderately valued.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 0 and 5. Item 0 is highly valued, and item 5 is the remaining item.

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences and ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
