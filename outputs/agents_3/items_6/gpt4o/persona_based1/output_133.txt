Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  64  85  42  12  23
1  68  76  73  71  56  26
2  77  84  90  41  40  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In this problem, we need to allocate 6 items among 3 agents in a way that is fair, considering each agent's valuation of each item. One common approach to achieve a fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [61, 64, 85, 42, 12, 23]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [68, 76, 73, 71, 56, 26]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [77, 84, 90, 41, 40, 67]

A simple way to allocate items is to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Allocate the highest valued item to each agent**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 90).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 76).
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 61).

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance the allocations**:
   - Since agent 2 has already received item 2, let's allocate item 5 to agent 2 (value 67).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (value 71).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 12).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and the allocation is conducted in a way that attempts to respect valuations. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

With this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the distribution is designed to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent's highest-valued items.
