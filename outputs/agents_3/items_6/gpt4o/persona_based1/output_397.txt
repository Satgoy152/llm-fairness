Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62   0  15  25  99  48
1  32  88   8  93  17  46
2  49  40  51  13  22  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents in such a way that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible. Here's one way to approach this problem:

First, let's list the items in the order of each agent's preference based on their valuations:

- Agent 0's preferences (in decreasing order of value): Item 4 (99), Item 0 (62), Item 5 (48), Item 3 (25), Item 2 (15), Item 1 (0).
- Agent 1's preferences: Item 3 (93), Item 1 (88), Item 5 (46), Item 0 (32), Item 4 (17), Item 2 (8).
- Agent 2's preferences: Item 2 (51), Item 0 (49), Item 1 (40), Item 4 (22), Item 5 (17), Item 3 (13).

Next, we aim to allocate items to minimize envy. We can use an iterative process, considering the highest valued items for each agent and ensuring each agent gets at least one of their top choices if possible.

1. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their highest value.
2. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.

Now, each agent has one item, and we have allocated 3 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

4. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their second highest value.
5. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their second highest value.
6. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2, as it is the next best available for them after Item 2 and Item 0 are taken.

This allocation should ensure that each agent is getting items based on their preferences, reducing envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
