Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  61  74   3   7  88
1  44  50  94  54  43  89
2  47  17  63  49  13  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation. A reasonable approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item (since there are 6 items and 3 agents).

First, let's consider each agent's highest valued items:

- Agent 0's highest values: Item 0 (88), Item 5 (88)
- Agent 1's highest values: Item 2 (94), Item 5 (89)
- Agent 2's highest values: Item 5 (67), Item 2 (63)

Given these preferences, an allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent first, trying to avoid conflicts.
2. Allocate remaining items based on the next highest valuations available.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values Item 2 (94) and Item 5 (89). Let's assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values Item 0 (88) and Item 5 (88) equally. Let's assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 5 (67) as their highest after Item 2, which is already taken. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Now, the remaining items are 1, 3, and 4.

For the remaining items:

- Assign Item 1 (61) to **Agent 0** as it's their next highest valued remaining item.
- Assign Item 3 (54) to **Agent 1** as it's their next highest valued remaining item.
- Assign Item 4 (49) to **Agent 2** as it's their next highest valued remaining item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair division of items based on each agent's preferences and aims to minimize envy among the agents.
