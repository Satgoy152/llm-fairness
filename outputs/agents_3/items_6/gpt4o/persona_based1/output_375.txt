Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  52  77  72  40  55
1  61  67  67  63  20  95
2  69  60  50  50  52  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels satisfied with their share relative to what others receive. A common approach is to use methods like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) or Envy-Free up to one item (EF1) to guide the allocation process. Here, I'll provide an allocation that tries to balance the values each agent receives.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [31, 52, 77, 72, 40, 55]
- **Agent 1**: [61, 67, 67, 63, 20, 95]
- **Agent 2**: [69, 60, 50, 50, 52, 61]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 2 and 3, as they have relatively high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize item 5 due to its high value, and balance with other items to ensure fairness.
3. **Agent 2**: Consider items 0 and 1, which have relatively high values for Agent 2.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [2, 3]
  - Values: 77 (item 2) + 72 (item 3) = 149
- **Agent 1**: [5, 4]
  - Values: 95 (item 5) + 20 (item 4) = 115
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1]
  - Values: 69 (item 0) + 60 (item 1) = 129

This allocation attempts to balance the total values received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
