Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  97   8  87  75   2
1  79   9  89  67  96  81
2  92  98  29   5  59  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 97  8 87 75  2]
 [79  9 89 67 96 81]
 [92 98 29  5 59 26]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the steps for the allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 87.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations** while ensuring each agent has at least one item:

   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

3. **Verify the allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
