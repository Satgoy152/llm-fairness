Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  20  95  73  56  66
1  58  27  19  56  75  49
2  33  32  88  90  67  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 32 88 90 67 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly. The goal is to minimize envy among agents by maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's calculate the total value each agent can derive from all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 75 + 20 + 95 + 73 + 56 + 66 = 385
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 58 + 27 + 19 + 56 + 75 + 49 = 284
- Agent 2's total valuation for all items: 33 + 32 + 88 + 90 + 67 + 26 = 336

Given these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values items 4, 0, and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values items 3, 2, and 4.

To distribute fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 2] (valued at 75 and 95) for a total valuation of 170.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [4, 5] (valued at 75 and 49) for a total valuation of 124.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [1, 3] (valued at 32 and 90) for a total valuation of 122.

This allocation allows each agent to receive items they highly value while minimizing potential envy.

Here is the fair allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
