Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  94  58  71  49  90
1   6  85  94  77  17  22
2  50  64  62  40  84  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 85 94 77 17 22]
 [50 64 62 40 84 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another. This involves selecting items that give each agent the highest possible value without creating envy.

Let's start by analyzing the values each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 values: [73, 94, 58, 71, 49, 90]
- Agent 1 values: [6, 85, 94, 77, 17, 22]
- Agent 2 values: [50, 64, 62, 40, 84, 98]

One approach to ensure a fair distribution is to allocate items in a way that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 94)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 98)

2. Assign remaining items considering the next highest values and ensuring a balanced distribution:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (value 73)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 77)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (value 84)

Now, each agent receives two items, which is a balanced allocation given the total of 6 items. This allocation also considers the highest preferences of each agent and ensures that no agent envies another based on the total value they receive.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
