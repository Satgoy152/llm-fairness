Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  67  48  82  64  67
1  68   8  73  88  42  66
2  96  57   5  65  19  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 57  5 65 19 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Ideally, we want each agent to value their allocation at least as much as the allocation any other agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values items 3 and 0 highly. Assigning them these items maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 highly, but it's already allocated. The next best available items based on their valuation are items 5 and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 0, but it's already allocated. The next best available items based on their valuation are items 1 and 4.

Performing an allocation based on highest available valuations:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 0]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 4]

This allocation attempts to maximize the total perceived value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
