Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  82  60  79   4  71
1  57  10  64  16   1  73
2  95  27  61  70  68  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 82 60 79  4 71]
 [57 10 64 16  1 73]
 [95 27 61 70 68 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free as much as possible, meaning each agent should be satisfied with their own allocation and should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We have 3 agents and 6 items, so each agent will receive exactly 2 items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [26, 82, 60, 79, 4, 71]
- Agent 1: [57, 10, 64, 16, 1, 73]
- Agent 2: [95, 27, 61, 70, 68, 77]

We will try to allocate the items so that each agent gets a pair of items they value highly, and attempt to keep the overall value distribution as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most with a value of 95. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most with a value of 82. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most with a value of 73. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
4. Next, consider the remaining high-value items:
   - For Agent 0, items 3 and 5 are highly valued, but item 5 is already taken. Among the remaining items, item 3 has a value of 79 for Agent 0.
   - For Agent 1, items 2 and 3 have decent values, but item 3 is already considered. Item 2 has a value of 64.
   - For Agent 2, item 5 was a high-value item, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 4 with a value of 68.

5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is the highest remaining for Agent 0.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the highest remaining for Agent 1.
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it is the highest remaining for Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 4

This allocation is reasonably balanced based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly.
