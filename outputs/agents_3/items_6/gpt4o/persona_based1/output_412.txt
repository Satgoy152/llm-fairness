Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  41  44  70   6  97
1  68  91  39  12  10  98
2  28  40  67   2  81  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 41 44 70  6 97]
 [68 91 39 12 10 98]
 [28 40 67  2 81 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that considers envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "round robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This method involves assigning items one by one to agents in a way that respects their preferences and attempts to minimize envy.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [52, 41, 44, 70, 6, 97]
Agent 1: [68, 91, 39, 12, 10, 98]
Agent 2: [28, 40, 67, 2, 81, 84]
```

We will proceed by selecting the highest-valued unallocated item for each agent in turn, until all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (valued at 97).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (valued at 91).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (valued at 81).

Next round:

4. **Agent 0** picks item 3 (valued at 70).
5. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (valued at 68).
6. **Agent 2** picks item 2 (valued at 67).

This allocation minimizes potential envy between agents given their preference rankings and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```
