Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  24  58  18  51  75  63
1  64  68  71  36  24  74
2  74  86  97  52  72  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. One approach to achieving an envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible) allocation is to use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, known as the maximin share (MMS) allocation. This method attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least as much as they would get in their worst-case scenario if they were to divide the items themselves.

Let's first calculate the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as: 24, 58, 18, 51, 75, 63. Total = 24 + 58 + 18 + 51 + 75 + 63 = 289.
- Agent 1 values the items as: 64, 68, 71, 36, 24, 74. Total = 64 + 68 + 71 + 36 + 24 + 74 = 337.
- Agent 2 values the items as: 74, 86, 97, 52, 72, 49. Total = 74 + 86 + 97 + 52 + 72 + 49 = 430.

Next, we strive to divide the items into bundles such that each agent receives a bundle whose value is as close as possible to their fair share, which we can assume to be approximately one-third of their total valuation.

Approximate fair shares:
- Agent 0: 289 / 3 ≈ 96.33
- Agent 1: 337 / 3 ≈ 112.33
- Agent 2: 430 / 3 ≈ 143.33

Now, let's try to allocate the items while considering these fair shares:

1. Agent 0:
   - Items 4 (75) and 3 (51), Total = 126

2. Agent 1:
   - Items 5 (74) and 2 (71), Total = 145

3. Agent 2:
   - Items 1 (86) and 0 (74), Total = 160

This allocation attempts to give each agent a bundle of items close to or above their approximate fair share.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
