Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  99  99  40  93  40
1  51  60  19  89  14  59
2  41  73  48  26  12  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 73 48 26 12 11]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels their allocation is as fair as possible given their individual valuations. One common approach is to try to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [63, 99, 99, 40, 93, 40]
- Agent 1: [51, 60, 19, 89, 14, 59]
- Agent 2: [41, 73, 48, 26, 12, 11]

A simple heuristic to achieve fairness is to first allocate items based on each agent's highest-valued items, while ensuring no agent receives all the high-value items. Since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: 99 (item 1 and 2), 93 (item 4)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: 89 (item 3), 60 (item 1), 59 (item 5)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: 73 (item 1), 48 (item 2), 41 (item 0)
   - Since item 1 is already allocated, allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest available)

Now, allocate remaining items to balance:

4. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate item 4 (next highest value available for Agent 0)

5. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 5 (next highest value available for Agent 1)

6. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 0 (highest value among remaining for Agent 2)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance fairness based on individual preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
