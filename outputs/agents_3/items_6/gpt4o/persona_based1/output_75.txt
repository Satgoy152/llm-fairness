Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3  4   5
0   1  28  39  83  2  45
1  71  95  79  83  4  70
2   1  61  58  15  3   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to distribute the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy. One method to achieve this is by using the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, which is a common approach in fair division.

Let's assess the situation and distribute the items:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (83).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (95).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (61).

2. **Allocate the highest value items to the respective agents:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to maximize fairness:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 5 (45) as their next highest value.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0 (71) as it provides them high utility.
   - Agent 2 receives item 2 (58) as their next highest value.
   - The remaining item, item 4, should be assigned to Agent 0 to balance the number of items and minimize envy.

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 5, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 0
- Agent 2: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their utility given the constraints, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the initial valuations.

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2]
}
```
