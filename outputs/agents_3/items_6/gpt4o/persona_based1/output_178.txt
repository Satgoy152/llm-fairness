Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  90  60  52  97  34
1  58  32  26  16   8  59
2  44  59  27  58  48  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close as possible, we need to allocate items such that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as good as any other agent's bundle. This can be quite challenging, especially with discrete items, but we can attempt to minimize envy by considering the valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 1 has relatively low valuations across all items, but item 5 stands out as valuable to them.
- Agent 2 has a more even distribution of values but does not highly prioritize any specific item.

A reasonable approach is to start by allocating the most valuable items for each agent and then adjust to ensure all items are distributed:

1. **Agent 0**: Ideal items are 0, 1, and 4 as they have high valuations for these items.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 is their highest valuation, and we can try to increase the total value of their allocation by giving them items they value reasonably.
3. **Agent 2**: Can be allocated leftover items that still contribute to a relatively high total value.

Let's propose an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 4

Now, let's check the total valuations for each agent with this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 69 (item 0) + 90 (item 1) = 159
- **Agent 1**: 59 (item 5) + 16 (item 3) = 75
- **Agent 2**: 27 (item 2) + 48 (item 4) = 75

This allocation allocates all 6 items and attempts to balance the perceived fairness based on the initial valuations. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy, given the constraints of discrete allocations and the agents' valuations.
