Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  16  90  43  41   9
1  78   2  94   2  35  77
2  62  61  60  73  91  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims to achieve fairness and envy-freeness, we can employ a method that optimizes for the highest value each agent can receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. 

Here's one approach to do this:

1. Start by determining which items have the highest valuation from each agent, and allocate those items accordingly.
2. Assign the remaining items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for all agents and minimizes envy.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the most (value 90).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 2 the most as well, but since Agent 0 can already receive item 2, we look for the next best option for Agent 1. Agent 1 values item 0 the second most (value 78).
- **Agent 2:** Has a high valuation for item 4 (value 91).

After assigning the highest valued items:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items [1, 3, 5] while attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

- **Remaining for Agent 0:** Items 3 (value 43) and 1 (value 16).
- **Remaining for Agent 1:** Item 5 (value 77).
- **Remaining for Agent 2:** No remaining items.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Item 4, 1

Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 1]
}
```
