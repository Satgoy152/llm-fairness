Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36   6  95  62  96  86
1  88  23  95  68  96  93
2  49  64  69  90   4  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 23 95 68 96 93]
 [49 64 69 90  4 28]]
Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we'll consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A common goal is to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives, ensuring that no agent envies another.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [36, 6, 95, 62, 96, 86]
- Agent 1: [88, 23, 95, 68, 96, 93]
- Agent 2: [49, 64, 69, 90, 4, 28]

To achieve a fair division, we'll attempt to give each agent items such that their total value is maximized relative to other possible allocations. We can use the following strategy:

1. **Allocate high-value items shared by multiple agents**: Items that are highly valued by more than one agent should be allocated carefully to ensure fairness. 

2. **Allocate unique high-value items**: If an item is highly valued by only one agent, allocate it to that agent.

3. **Balance remaining allocations**: Once unique high-value items are distributed, allocate remaining items to balance total valuations.

Following this strategy:

- **Item 4** is valued highly (96) by both agents 0 and 1. We can allocate it to agent 1, who also values it at 96, ensuring they receive a high-value item.
- **Item 2** is valued at 95 by both agents 0 and 1. To balance, we give it to agent 0.
- **Item 3** has the highest value (90) from agent 2, so we allocate it to them.
- **Item 5** is highly valued by agent 1 (93) and relatively lower by the others, so we allocate it to agent 1.
- **Item 0** can be allocated to agent 0, as it is decently valued (36) and can help balance the total value.
- **Item 1** can be allocated to agent 2, as they value it at 64, which is higher than the other agents.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives and minimize envy among agents.
