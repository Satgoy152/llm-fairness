Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90   5  29  28  49  45
1   6  64  62  17  51  13
2  17  54  65  96  49  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 64 62 17 51 13]
 [17 54 65 96 49 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free and each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Given the valuation table, we'll aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while attempting to minimize envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (90).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (64).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (96).

2. **Initial Allocation of High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - For the remaining items (2, 4, 5), consider the next highest valuations by each agent.

4. **Allocating Item 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (65). Assign item 2 to agent 2.

5. **Allocating Item 4:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 next highest (51). Assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Allocating Item 5:**
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (94). Assign item 5 to agent 2.

7. **Review and Adjust if Necessary:**
   - Ensure all items are assigned and every agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, checking for potential adjustments to reduce any envy.

Based on the above steps, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the distribution seeks to balance the total valuations across agents.
