Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  44  50  72  83  65
1  33  75  72  87  13  91
2  23  27  36  80  55  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 44 50 72 83 65]
 [33 75 72 87 13 91]
 [23 27 36 80 55 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible, meaning each agent should feel they received as much value as any other agent from their perspective. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility.

Let's consider the valuations from the table:

```
Agent 0: [65, 44, 50, 72, 83, 65]
Agent 1: [33, 75, 72, 87, 13, 91]
Agent 2: [23, 27, 36, 80, 55, 52]
```

We can approach this problem using a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign items based on maximizing value for each agent while trying to maintain balance. Here's how we can allocate these items:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for Agent 0 (83).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1 (91).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for Agent 2 (80).
4. Now, assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has the next highest value for Agent 1 (75).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the next highest value for Agent 0 (65).
6. Finally, assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it provides a good balance (50).

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' perceived values and minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual utility, given the constraints.
