Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  41  86  66  19   1
1  52  38  91  21  25  19
2  53  42  60  47  25  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. We will utilize a method that distributes the items based on maximizing each agent's individual valuation while attempting to maintain fairness.

Let's consider the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 35     | 41     | 86     | 66     | 19     | 1      |
| 1     | 52     | 38     | 91     | 21     | 25     | 19     |
| 2     | 53     | 42     | 60     | 47     | 25     | 23     |

To achieve an allocation, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is only allocated once and that each agent receives approximately an equal share of total value.

2. Adjust assignments if necessary to ensure all items are allocated and to improve fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations for items 2 and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations for items 2 and 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations for items 0 and 2.

To resolve conflicts and ensure all items are assigned:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest valuation.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it's the next highest available value for them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their next best choice.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it is still available and they value it higher than Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 2 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 0, 1, and 5.

This allocation is as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
