Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  82  87   4  65  10
1  94  89  89  86  23  89
2  30  98  71  46   2  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's proceed through the following steps:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**  
   We will first identify the items that are highly valued by each agent and try to allocate those items accordingly.

2. **Allocate Based on High Valuation:**  
   We'll start by allocating items that are most valued by each agent, as this is likely to reduce envy.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**  
   After allocating high-value items, distribute the remaining items so that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [59, 82, 87, 4, 65, 10]
- Agent 1: [94, 89, 89, 86, 23, 89]
- Agent 2: [30, 98, 71, 46, 2, 33]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **High-Valuation Allocation:**
   - Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2 (98), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1 (94), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Remaining High-Valuation Allocation:**
   - Item 2 is valued equally by Agents 0 and 1 (87 and 89, respectively), but Agent 0 has a slightly higher preference for item 2 over other available items. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 (86), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Item 4 is left, and its highest valuation is with Agent 0 (65), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Item 5 is left for Agent 1, as they have a relatively high valuation of 89 compared to other available options.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they value highly, which should minimize envy.

{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1]
}
