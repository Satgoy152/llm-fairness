Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  11  91  59  57  55
1  11  94  26  12  42  13
2  28   0  27  59  57  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we aim to minimize envy and try to achieve an envy-free allocation. Given that each agent has different valuations for each item, here is one approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 39 + 11 + 91 + 59 + 57 + 55 = 312
   - Agent 1: 11 + 94 + 26 + 12 + 42 + 13 = 198
   - Agent 2: 28 + 0 + 27 + 59 + 57 + 33 = 204

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations to reduce envy.

3. **Assign Each Item:**
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (91). Assign it to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1 (94). Assign it to Agent 1.
   - Items 3 and 4 are valued equally by Agent 0 and 2, but Agent 2 has no items yet, so assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (57).
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (55) because it is the highest remaining value for Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (28) because Agent 1 does not value it highly and Agent 2 has only one item.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (12) as it is the highest remaining value for Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure each item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Based on the above strategy, here is the final allocation in the specified format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, thus minimizing envy.
