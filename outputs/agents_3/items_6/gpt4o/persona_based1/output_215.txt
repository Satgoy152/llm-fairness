Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  58  42  35  12  24
1  25  36  45  31  20  50
2  41  48  47  64  13  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I'll aim to ensure envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List Agents and Items:** We have 3 agents (0, 1, 2) and 6 items (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

2. **Initial Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [64, 58, 42, 35, 12, 24]
   - Agent 1: [25, 36, 45, 31, 20, 50]
   - Agent 2: [41, 48, 47, 64, 13, 26]

3. **Determine Preferences:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most, followed by item 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most, followed by item 2.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most, followed by item 2.

4. **Fair Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items based on agent preferences, ensuring each agent gets an item they highly value.
   - Continue allocating the remaining items while maintaining a balance so no one envies another's allocation.

5. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

6. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 also values item 1 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 as the second highest. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 less but has no allocation yet beyond the initial item. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

7. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: [2, 5]
   - Agent 2: [3, 4]

This allocation should be envy-free given the preferences and valuations provided. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
