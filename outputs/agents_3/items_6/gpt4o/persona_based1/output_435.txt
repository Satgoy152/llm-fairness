Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51   1  11  23  23   5
1   7  72  12  47  63  26
2  64  63  25  63  84  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51  1 11 23 23  5]
 [ 7 72 12 47 63 26]
 [64 63 25 63 84 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring each agent gets as close to their fair share as possible. Given the valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their individual valuation.

Firstly, we calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \( 51 + 1 + 11 + 23 + 23 + 5 = 114 \)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \( 7 + 72 + 12 + 47 + 63 + 26 = 227 \)
- Agent 2's total valuation: \( 64 + 63 + 25 + 63 + 84 + 10 = 309 \)

Next, we determine a fair allocation by considering the proportional share each agent should receive based on their valuations. Since there are 6 items, we aim to distribute them such that each agent gets a bundle of items close to their proportional value.

After analyzing the values, one possible fair allocation is:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation considers the highest values each agent places on different items:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 5, with values 51, 11, and 5 respectively, totaling 67.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4, with values 72 and 63 respectively, totaling 135.
- Agent 2 gets item 3, with a value of 63.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation achieves a balance where each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences, and the total number of items allocated is 6, satisfying the problem constraints.
