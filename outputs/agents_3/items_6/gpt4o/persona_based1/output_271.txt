Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  59  71  50  44  19
1  71  11  36  54  56  38
2  94   6   4  34  82  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to allocate the items such that envy among the agents is minimized. One common method for fair division is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion or the "Max-Min" method. Here, we will use a heuristic approach to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with the items they receive.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 50
  - Item 4: 44
  - Item 5: 19

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 54
  - Item 4: 56
  - Item 5: 38

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 82
  - Item 5: 14

To ensure fairness, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value highest, to the extent possible, while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. Assign items based on highest valuations first:
   - Agent 2 values Item 0 the most (94), so assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (71), so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most, but it's already assigned; the next is Item 4 (56), so assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

2. Continue with the next highest unallocated item for each agent:
   - Agent 2 next values Item 4 (82), but it’s taken; next is Item 3 (34), so assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 next values Item 1 (59), so assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 next values Item 3 (54), but it’s taken; next is Item 5 (38), so assign Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. Allocate remaining items:
   - Only Item 4 is left, and it must go to the agent with the least total value so far. Agent 0 has received items with values 71 + 59 = 130, Agent 1 has 56 + 38 = 94, and Agent 2 has 94 + 34 = 128. 
   - Since Agent 1 has the least total value, assign the remaining Item 4 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
