Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65   0  25  57   0  51
1  64  19  19  64  97   9
2  65  42  21  50  19  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. We can use a simple algorithm, like the "round-robin" method, to help ensure fairness, but let's attempt to maximize each agent's value based on their preferences.

Let's start by analyzing the preferences of each agent:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most, followed by items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest and item 1 as the next most valuable.

A potential allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it the highest.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is one of their most valued items.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it higher than the other agents.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it is their third most valued item.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it balances the allocation and is valued moderately by all.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

Each agent receives two items, and this allocation maximizes each agent's value based on their preferences while keeping the distribution fair.
