Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  15  47   4  86  33
1  47  26  45  23  35  45
2  28  72  45  95  64  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use a method based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. Our goal is to ensure that each agent receives the items in such a way that they feel their share is as valuable as possible given their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Items values: 11, 15, 47, 4, 86, 33

Agent 1:
- Items values: 47, 26, 45, 23, 35, 45

Agent 2:
- Items values: 28, 72, 45, 95, 64, 36

We want to allocate the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is maximized, and the allocation is envy-free if possible. A simple heuristic is to assign the most valuable items to each agent based on their unique preferences.

Let's start by identifying which items have the highest value for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (86).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (47) and item 5 (45).
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (95).

Now, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 86 for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 47 for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 45 for Agent 1).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 95 for Agent 2).
5. Now, we have items 1 and 2 left. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 72 for Agent 2).
6. Lastly, assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 47 for Agent 0).

The allocations are now as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 4 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 1

This allocation tries to respect the highest values while dividing items in a way that reduces envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
