Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58   7  67  99  28  76
1  61  63  20  92  46  43
2  21  55  89  26   7  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58  7 67 99 28 76]
 [61 63 20 92 46 43]
 [21 55 89 26  7 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that ensures envy-freeness or as close to it as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 7, 67, 99, 28, 76]
- Agent 1's valuations: [61, 63, 20, 92, 46, 43]
- Agent 2's valuations: [21, 55, 89, 26, 7, 30]

One common approach is to use a greedy method where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Let's apply this approach:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (58).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (63).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (89).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (46).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (76).

However, this allocation results in Agent 0 receiving three items, Agent 1 receiving two items, and Agent 2 receiving one item. Let's adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is six. We will aim to balance the number of items each agent receives while maintaining high valuations.

To balance the allocation and ensure fairness:
- Reallocate item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and it respects the highest possible individual valuations while balancing the distribution.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
