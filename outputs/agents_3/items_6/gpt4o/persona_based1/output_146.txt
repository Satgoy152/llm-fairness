Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  12  59  64  93  76
1  16  96  61  31  86  71
2  60  77   2  96   7  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 12 59 64 93 76]
 [16 96 61 31 86 71]
 [60 77  2 96  7 42]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can use an algorithmic approach, such as the "Envy-Free Matching" algorithm, to attempt this.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Valuation Table

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  12  59  64  93  76
1  16  96  61  31  86  71
2  60  77   2  96   7  42
```

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Assign highest valued items first**: Begin by allocating each agent their highest valued item that is still available and move forward.

2. **Iterative Allocation**: For remaining items, consider remaining valuations and allocate to the agent who values them most, ensuring no envy is introduced if possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 4 (93), allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (96), allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 3 (96), allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Remaining Items: 0, 2, 5

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 60 (highest remaining), allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 59 (highest remaining), allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 76 (highest remaining), allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation

After balancing valuations and allocations, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints and aims to minimize potential envy among the agents.
