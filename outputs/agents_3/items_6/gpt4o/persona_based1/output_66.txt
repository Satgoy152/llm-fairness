Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82   5  28  57  39  80
1  17  92  86  23  64  55
2   6  13  15  35  71  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82  5 28 57 39 80]
 [17 92 86 23 64 55]
 [ 6 13 15 35 71 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other allocation they could have received.

## Valuations Table

- Agent 0: [82, 5, 28, 57, 39, 80]
- Agent 1: [17, 92, 86, 23, 64, 55]
- Agent 2: [6, 13, 15, 35, 71, 65]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (82) and item 5 (80).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 (92) and item 2 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (71) and item 3 (35).

### Allocations:

- **Agent 0** will receive items 0 and 5.
- **Agent 1** will receive items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 2** will receive items 3 and 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, maintaining a fair division where the potential for envy is minimized.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
