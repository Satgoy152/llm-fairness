Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  75  10  13  60  35
1   7  52  50   9  55  58
2  79  46  20  14  88  98
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the agents' valuations for each item, let's explore a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 0 and item 1. Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them a high total value.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 and item 4 quite highly. Allocating these to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 the most, but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, we can allocate items 2 and 3 because they are less value to other agents and Agent 2 values item 4 the most after item 5.

Let's assign the items accordingly:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and the total number of items allocated is six.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
