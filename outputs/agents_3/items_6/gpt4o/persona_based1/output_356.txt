Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54   5  58  65  10  23
1  22  53  54  39  71  86
2   9  95  72  41  92  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider each agent's valuations of the items. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify preferences**: 
   - Agent 0: Highest values: Item 3 (65), Item 2 (58), Item 0 (54)
   - Agent 1: Highest values: Item 5 (86), Item 4 (71), Item 2 (54)
   - Agent 2: Highest values: Item 1 (95), Item 4 (92), Item 2 (72)

2. **Allocate items by preference**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item.
   - Resolve conflicts by considering the second highest or third highest valued items.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 3
   - Agent 1: Item 5
   - Agent 2: Item 1

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items left: 0, 2, 4
   - Assign these to agents to balance the allocation while considering their next highest preferences.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3 and Item 0 (next highest available preference).
   - Agent 1 gets Item 5 and Item 4 (next highest preference).
   - Agent 2 gets Item 1 and Item 2 (next highest preference).

The allocation aims to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences for available items.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
