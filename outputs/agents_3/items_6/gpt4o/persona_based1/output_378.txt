Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71   2   7  34  68  84
1  28  25  73  37  98  17
2  58  73  28  55  53  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each allocation is envy-free, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring the overall allocation minimizes envy.

Let's calculate the maximum possible valuation each agent can get by considering different allocations. The goal is to find a distribution where each agent is as content as possible with their share.

Here is one possible approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [71, 2, 7, 34, 68, 84]
   - Highest valuations are for items: 0 (71) and 5 (84).
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [28, 25, 73, 37, 98, 17]
   - Highest valuations are for items: 4 (98) and 2 (73).
   - Allocate items 4 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [58, 73, 28, 55, 53, 37]
   - Highest valuations are for items: 1 (73) and 3 (55).
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items for which they have the highest valuations, thereby minimizing envy.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items they value highly.
