Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  10   6  36  94  51
1  80  63  70  77  71  52
2  66   3  14  94  33  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66  3 14 94 33 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. The goal is to assign the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 40 | 10 | 6  | 36 | 94 | 51 |
| 1          | 80 | 63 | 70 | 77 | 71 | 52 |
| 2          | 66 | 3  | 14 | 94 | 33 | 57 |

To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we will aim to maximize each agent's valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has a high valuation for item 4 (94). Assigning item 4 to Agent 0 maximizes their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0 (80) and item 3 (77). Assigning these items to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 (57) and item 3 (94), but since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, we can assign item 5 to them. The remaining items 1 and 2 can also be assigned to Agent 2 since they have low valuations for these items, but they are the remaining items to be allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes each agent's valuation based on the available items, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.
