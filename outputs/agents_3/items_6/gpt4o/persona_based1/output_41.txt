Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  53  93  28  65  56
1  40  89  87  70  29   0
2  12  55  28   4  60  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 89 87 70 29  0]
 [12 55 28  4 60 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for their allocated items, while also striving for envy-freeness as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (93)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (65)
   - Third highest: Item 0 and Item 5 (56)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (89)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (87)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (70)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (87)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (60)
   - Third highest: Item 1 (55)

### Allocating Items:
- **Assign Agent 0:**
  - Give Item 2 (93) - highest for Agent 0
  - Give Item 0 (56) - next highest and not highly valued by others

- **Assign Agent 1:**
  - Give Item 1 (89) - highest for Agent 1
  - Give Item 3 (70) - next high preference for Agent 1

- **Assign Agent 2:**
  - Give Item 5 (87) - highest for Agent 2
  - Give Item 4 (60) - second highest for Agent 2

### Resulting Allocation:
- Each agent gets items that maximize their valuation based on remaining available items.
- Attempted to ensure that no agent strongly envies another's allocation by making sure each gets at least one of their top preferences.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the three agents, with consideration given to each agent's highest valuations to promote fairness and minimize envy.
