Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  23  26   2   6  84
1  97  52  49  83   7   8
2  91   7  35  79  72  21
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 23 26  2  6 84]
 [97 52 49 83  7  8]
 [91  7 35 79 72 21]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility for all agents and trying to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [86, 23, 26, 2, 6, 84]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [97, 52, 49, 83, 7, 8]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [91, 7, 35, 79, 72, 21]

We aim to allocate the 6 items such that each agent receives a fair share, balancing the total value received by each agent. Here is one possible allocation that attempts to balance the valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1: This item has the highest value for Agent 1.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0: It's not highly valued by any, but helps balance.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0: This item is moderately valued by Agent 0.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1: This item is highly valued by Agent 1.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2: This item is highly valued by Agent 2.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0: This item is highly valued by Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation allows each agent to receive items based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.
