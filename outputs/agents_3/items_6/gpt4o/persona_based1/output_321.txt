Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  77  95  79  35  90
1  43  43   7  70  21  44
2  36  50  37   8  90  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ideally offers some form of fairness, such as maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring proportionality. Given the valuations, let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. To ensure fairness, we can give Agent 0 the items with the highest total value according to their perspective.
2. **Agent 1** has relatively lower valuations compared to others. We should aim to allocate items to maximize their utility.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 and has moderate values for items 5 and 1. 

Considering the above, let's propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, and 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the interests of each agent by giving them a combination of items that maximizes their individual valuations while trying to maintain overall fairness.
