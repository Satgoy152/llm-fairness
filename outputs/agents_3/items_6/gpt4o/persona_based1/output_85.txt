Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  79  84  88  51  47
1  91  32  85  17  51  43
2   3  38  94  21  83  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 79 84 88 51 47]
 [91 32 85 17 51 43]
 [ 3 38 94 21 83 48]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [14, 79, 84, 88, 51, 47]
Agent 1: [91, 32, 85, 17, 51, 43]
Agent 2: [3, 38, 94, 21, 83, 48]
```

We will aim to maximize the perceived value each agent receives by allocating items that are valued highly by the respective agents.

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (88) the most, followed by item 2 (84).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (91) the most, followed by item 2 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 (94) the most, followed by item 4 (83).

### Allocation Process:

1. **Allocate item 0** to Agent 1 because it is most valued by Agent 1.
2. **Allocate item 3** to Agent 0 because it is most valued by Agent 0.
3. **Allocate item 4** to Agent 2 because it is most valued by Agent 2.
4. **Allocate item 2** to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly and Agent 1 already received a highly valued item (item 0).
5. **Allocate item 1** to Agent 2 because Agent 2 has a moderate valuation compared to Agent 1.
6. **Allocate item 5** to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 has items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 has items 1 and 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents while respecting each agent's preferences as much as possible.

{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
