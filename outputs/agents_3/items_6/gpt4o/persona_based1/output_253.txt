Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  18   3  40  90  63
1  86  78   3  60  98  26
2  64  54  35  76  83  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 18  3 40 90 63]
 [86 78  3 60 98 26]
 [64 54 35 76 83 81]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations. This is typically done through an envy-free allocation mechanism, but given the constraints that each agent needs to receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we can use a heuristic approach to approximate fairness.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [35, 18, 3, 40, 90, 63]
- Agent 1: [86, 78, 3, 60, 98, 26]
- Agent 2: [64, 54, 35, 76, 83, 81]

Given these valuations, a possible strategy is to allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation while minimizing envy. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 64
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 78 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 54
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 3
   - Agent 2 values it at 35 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Agent 2 values it at 76 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 98 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 83
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Agent 2 values it at 81 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3, 5]

Let's display the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
