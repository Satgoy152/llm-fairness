Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  51  84   3  10  35
1  78  55  30  67   6  70
2   7  77  91  56  53  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [78 55 30 67  6 70]
 [ 7 77 91 56 53 53]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives to ensure no agent is envious of another. This is also known as the maximin share guarantee. Let's compute the total value for each agent and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives as high a value as possible.

Here is the table of valuations for reference:

```
   0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  51  84   3  10  35
1  78  55  30  67   6  70
2   7  77  91  56  53  53
```

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Compute Total Valuations**: Calculate the total value each agent can obtain by summing up the values they assign to all items.
   - Agent 0: \(20 + 51 + 84 + 3 + 10 + 35 = 203\)
   - Agent 1: \(78 + 55 + 30 + 67 + 6 + 70 = 306\)
   - Agent 2: \(7 + 77 + 91 + 56 + 53 + 53 = 337\)

2. **Assign Items**:
   - Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives items close to their maximin share.
   - Ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible by adjusting allocations to balance agent satisfaction.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 2; assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly; assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 and 3 highly; assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.
   - For the remaining items, consider assigning based on remaining high valuations:
     - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This distribution aims to balance the total value for each agent and ensure no agent is significantly envious of another. The goal is to maximize the minimum satisfaction level across agents.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and all six items are allocated. Each agent receives a fair amount of value based on their preferences, reducing potential envy.
