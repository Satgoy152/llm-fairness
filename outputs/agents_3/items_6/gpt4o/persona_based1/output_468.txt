Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  89  47  91  84   7
1  82  67  82   7  95  60
2  16  27  36  17  72   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as envy-free as possible. This involves attempting to allocate items to agents in a way that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of another agent. 

Let's examine the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

```
Agent 0: [49, 89, 47, 91, 84, 7]
Agent 1: [82, 67, 82, 7, 95, 60]
Agent 2: [16, 27, 36, 17, 72, 7]
```

To attempt an envy-free allocation, consider the following approach:

1. **Identify items with highest value for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (95).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 highly (72) but not higher than Agent 1. The next highest for Agent 2 is item 2 (36).

2. **Allocate items based on highest individual valuation while trying to ensure fairness:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute remaining items to achieve fairness:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 0's next best item is item 1 (89).
   - Agent 1's next best item is item 0 (82).
   - Agent 2 can take item 5 (7).

Based on this analysis, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, which they value at 89 and 91, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4, which they value at 82 and 95, respectively.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 5, which they value at 36 and 7, respectively.

This distribution attempts to maintain a balance where each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy among the agents.
