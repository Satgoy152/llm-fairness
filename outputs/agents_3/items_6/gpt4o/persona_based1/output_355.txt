Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  43   1  76  76  75
1  99  33  10  58  86  96
2  36  90  23  49  41  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that strives for fairness and minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. However, given the constraint of distributing exactly 6 items among 3 agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's one approach we can take:

1. **Greedy Round-Robin Allocation**: Each agent picks their most valued item in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated. This method aims to maximize each agent's happiness with their allocation relative to their own valuations.

Let's see how this works with the provided data:

Agent valuations:
- Agent 0: [74, 43, 1, 76, 76, 75]
- Agent 1: [99, 33, 10, 58, 86, 96]
- Agent 2: [36, 90, 23, 49, 41, 93]

**Round 1:**
- Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 76)
- Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 99)
- Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 90)

**Round 2:**
- Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 76)
- Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 96)
- Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 23)

This allocation method ensures each agent receives two items, and they prioritize their highest-valued items available during their turn.

Given the allocations above, the final allocation of items to agents is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair by allowing each agent to select items in a manner that maximizes their perceived value.
