Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  82   2  51  11  76
1  10  94  12  41  72  43
2  50  45  66  89  77  83
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 82  2 51 11 76]
 [10 94 12 41 72 43]
 [50 45 66 89 77 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes the items as evenly as possible in terms of perceived value. Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [49, 82, 2, 51, 11, 76]
- Agent 1: [10, 94, 12, 41, 72, 43]
- Agent 2: [50, 45, 66, 89, 77, 83]

We need to allocate all 6 items to the agents. A possible approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities (valuations) each agent receives from their allocated items. This often leads to envy-free allocations or at least minimizes envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated items 0 and 5
   - Item 0 value: 49
   - Item 5 value: 76
   - Total value: 49 + 76 = 125

2. **Agent 1**: Allocated items 1 and 4
   - Item 1 value: 94
   - Item 4 value: 72
   - Total value: 94 + 72 = 166

3. **Agent 2**: Allocated items 2 and 3
   - Item 2 value: 66
   - Item 3 value: 89
   - Total value: 66 + 89 = 155

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on the items they value most, and it attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
