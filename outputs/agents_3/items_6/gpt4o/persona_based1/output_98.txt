Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  21  12  17  62  87
1  97  26  27   4  14  37
2  27  50  16  85   8  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 26 27  4 14 37]
 [27 50 16 85  8 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness, potentially achieving envy-freeness or at least minimizing envy. We will use a method to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(79 + 21 + 12 + 17 + 62 + 87 = 278\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(97 + 26 + 27 + 4 + 14 + 37 = 205\)
- Agent 2's total valuation: \(27 + 50 + 16 + 85 + 8 + 86 = 272\)

Next, we can apply a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on their valuation while keeping the allocation fair. A common method to achieve this is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 87)
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 97)
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 85)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 62)
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 27)
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 50)

This leads to the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 4
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 1

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their valuations, and the items are distributed fairly given the agents' preferences.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
