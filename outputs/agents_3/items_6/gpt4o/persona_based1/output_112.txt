Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  55  33  24  46  47
1  50  59  28  78  77  24
2  40  40  36  85  89  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers envy-freeness and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.
2. **Prioritize High-Valuation Items:** Assign items to agents such that items with high valuations for a particular agent are allocated to them. This minimizes envy by ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.
3. **Ensure Each Item is Allocated:** Verify that all items are allocated across the agents and that no item is left unassigned.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(26 + 55 + 33 + 24 + 46 + 47 = 231\)
- Agent 1: \(50 + 59 + 28 + 78 + 77 + 24 = 316\)
- Agent 2: \(40 + 40 + 36 + 85 + 89 + 93 = 383\)

Next, we look to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's utility and distributing items in a manner that minimizes envy.

### Initial Allocation
1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 1 and 5. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 4 and 5. However, since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0, assign item 4 to Agent 2.

### Remaining Items

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more than others.

Taking into account the above analysis, the allocation can be finalized as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 1, 5, 2
2. **Agent 1**: Items 3, 0
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, while also distributing the available items evenly and ensuring that all items are allocated.
