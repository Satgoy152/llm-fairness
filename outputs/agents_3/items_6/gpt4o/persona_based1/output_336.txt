Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  57  86   9  45  43
1  13  59  85  16  34  19
2  97  57  36  25  18   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while keeping in mind the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, and no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Let's start by examining the valuations and considering the best possible allocations:

**Agent 0**:  
- Values highest on item 2 (86) and item 1 (57).
  
**Agent 1**:  
- Values highest on item 2 (85) and item 1 (59).

**Agent 2**:  
- Values highest on item 0 (97) and item 1 (57).

To achieve a fair division, we need to maximize the total value each agent gets while minimizing envy. Let's try to allocate based on these observations:

1. **Agent 2** is the only one who values item 0 the most, so we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** and **Agent 1** both value item 2 highly, but since Agent 0 values it slightly higher, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 1 slightly more than the others, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Remaining items are 3, 4, and 5. We'll distribute these based on remaining valuations:
   - Agent 0 and Agent 1 might want item 4, but Agent 1 gets it since Agent 0 already got item 2.
   - Item 3 will go to Agent 0 as it still has room and Agent 1 has already received two items.
   - Finally, item 5 will go to Agent 2, as it's the least valued by others, and Agent 2 has only one item so far.

Final allocation based on the valuation distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 5

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their bundle while considering fairness.
