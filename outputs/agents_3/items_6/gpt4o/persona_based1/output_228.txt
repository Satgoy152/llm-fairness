Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  17  48  97  33  84
1  57  30  16  18  19  59
2  54  78  71  89  98  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 78 71 89 98 49]]
Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation among the agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items. Here, we'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly relative to the others, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations given in the table:

```
        Items
Agents  0   1   2   3   4   5
0       65  17  48  97  33  84
1       57  30  16  18  19  59
2       54  78  71  89  98  49
```

A possible fair allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because they value it the most.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because they value it the most.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 0 because they value it the most after item 3.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because they value it the most after item 4.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because they value it the most after item 4 and item 2.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because it's the only remaining item and agent 1 values it reasonably well.

This allocation considers the highest value items for each agent and distributes the items fairly based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, based on the given valuations, and all items are allocated.
