Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  98  98  43  52  18
1  79  11  35  90  81   8
2  28  65  79  13  22  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's individual valuation of their allocated items while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Highest valuations: Items 1 and 2 (98 each)
   - Next highest valuation: Item 0 (29)

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (90)
   - Next highest valuations: Items 0 (79) and 4 (81)

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (79)
   - Next highest valuations: Item 1 (65) and 5 (52)

To ensure a fair allocation, we will focus on assigning the highest-valued items to each agent, considering all agents' preferences:

- **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:** This is one of their highest-valued items.
- **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:** This is their highest-valued item.
- **Assign Item 5 to Agent 2:** This is one of their higher-valued items.

Next, we allocate the remaining items:

- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:** This item is highly valued by Agent 0 and Agent 2, but since Agent 2 got Item 5, we prioritize Agent 0.
- **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1:** This is the next highest-valued item for Agent 1 after their highest preference (Item 3).
- **Assign Item 0 to Agent 2:** This is the next available item, and Agent 2 has the lowest overall envy with this allocation.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives a set of items that aligns with their preferences as closely as possible, minimizing potential envy.
