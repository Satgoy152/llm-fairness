Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  77  79  45  26  56
1  55  22  48  53  70  19
2  84  16   8  48  10  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 22 48 53 70 19]
 [84 16  8 48 10 36]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, let's consider allocating items based on maximizing each agent's valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives some items and the total allocation is exactly 6 items.

First, let's summarize the valuations for easier reference:

- Agent 0: [65, 77, 79, 45, 26, 56]
- Agent 1: [55, 22, 48, 53, 70, 19]
- Agent 2: [84, 16,  8, 48, 10, 36]

To ensure fairness, we'll consider the maximum valuations for each item and try to distribute items to the agents based on these valuations, while keeping an eye on the total number of items each agent receives. We'll attempt to allocate items to the agent that values them the most, but also balance the number of items given to each agent.

1. **Item 0:** Highest value by Agent 2 (84).
2. **Item 1:** Highest value by Agent 0 (77).
3. **Item 2:** Highest value by Agent 0 (79).
4. **Item 3:** Highest value by Agent 0 (45).
5. **Item 4:** Highest value by Agent 1 (70).
6. **Item 5:** Highest value by Agent 0 (56).

Balancing the allocation:
- Agent 0 is currently assigned items [1, 2, 3, 5] with total valuation 257.
- Agent 1 is assigned item [4] with valuation 70.
- Agent 2 is assigned item [0] with valuation 84.

To balance the allocation and ensure each agent receives at least one item, we can reassign some items:

- Reassign item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1's second-highest valuation item).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [0]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0]
}
```
