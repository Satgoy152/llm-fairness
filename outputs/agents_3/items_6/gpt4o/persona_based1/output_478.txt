Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  53  11  61  18  20
1  24   8  89  27  26  12
2  22  79  29  20  54  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair distribution of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy. Here is one potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:** It seems they value item 3 the most (61), followed by item 1 (53). Assigning these items to Agent 0 can maximize their utility.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 2 the most (89). Assigning item 2 to Agent 1 maximizes their utility. Also, item 4 has a relatively higher valuation (26) for them compared to the other agents.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (90), and they also have a relatively high valuation for item 1 (79), but since item 1 is already allocated, we consider item 0 (22), which they value more than others.

Given these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5.

The allocations are represented in JSON format as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
