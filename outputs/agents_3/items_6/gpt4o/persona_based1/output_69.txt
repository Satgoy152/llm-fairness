Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  95  78  56  42  73
1  52  46  42  72  25  38
2  30  80  81  14  14  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. One approach is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives, aiming to balance their satisfaction as evenly as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations and find a fair distribution:

Agent 0's valuations: [99, 95, 78, 56, 42, 73]  
Agent 1's valuations: [52, 46, 42, 72, 25, 38]  
Agent 2's valuations: [30, 80, 81, 14, 14, 89]  

A possible fair allocation considering the valuations could be:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 2.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 2.
4. Item 4 can be given to Agent 1 to balance their allocation.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]

This allocation tries to balance the highest valued items each agent receives, aiming for a fair division without envy. Here's the allocation in the specified format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
