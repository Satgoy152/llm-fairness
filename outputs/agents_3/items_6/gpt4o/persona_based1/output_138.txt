Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  47  95  64  45  89
1  40   8  94  57  61  59
2  26  63  41  47  14  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40  8 94 57 61 59]
 [26 63 41 47 14 95]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy. One possible way is to use a greedy algorithm, which assigns items to the agents based on maximizing their respective valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. List all items with their valuations for each agent:

    - Item 0: [25, 40, 26]
    - Item 1: [47, 8, 63]
    - Item 2: [95, 94, 41]
    - Item 3: [64, 57, 47]
    - Item 4: [45, 61, 14]
    - Item 5: [89, 59, 95]

2. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and there's a balanced distribution:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (40 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (63 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (95 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (64 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (61 is the highest valuation)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (95 is the highest valuation)

3. Verify that each agent gets a fair share:

   - Agent 0 has items [2, 3]
   - Agent 1 has items [0, 4]
   - Agent 2 has items [1, 5]

Each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated, which maintains a balance and attempts to maximize individual satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
