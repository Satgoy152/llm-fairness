Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  74  39  30  13  26
1  71  77  75  58  42  48
2   4  48  87  50  79  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 48 87 50 79 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to achieve envy-freeness where possible. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuation of the items they received.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [65, 74, 39, 30, 13, 26]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [71, 77, 75, 58, 42, 48]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [4, 48, 87, 50, 79, 70]

A possible approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We'll aim to allocate items so that no agent envies another based on their own valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 2:** Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (87). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (77). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (65). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, each agent has one item. We need to allocate the remaining items: 3, 4, and 5.

4. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values item 4 highly (79). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values item 3 highly (58) after item 1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 2 values item 5 highly (70) after items 2 and 4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items they value highly, aiming for a fair distribution where agents are likely to be satisfied with their share given their valuations.
