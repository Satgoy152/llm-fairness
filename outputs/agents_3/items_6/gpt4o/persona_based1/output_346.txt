Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  14  60  77  48  16
1   9  31  65  44  38  46
2  79   1  86  44   5  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, one common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. In this problem, we need to ensure that each agent is allocated an integer number of items and that the total allocation covers all 6 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0:  [60, 14, 60, 77, 48, 16]
Agent 1:  [9, 31, 65, 44, 38, 46]
Agent 2:  [79, 1, 86, 44, 5, 84]
```

We will aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring a fair distribution.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 3:** Highest value for Agent 0 with 77. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2:** Highest value for Agent 2 with 86. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 4:** Allocate to the agent with the highest valuation, which is Agent 0 with 48.
4. **Item 5:** Allocate to the agent with the highest valuation, which is Agent 2 with 84.
5. **Item 0:** Allocate to the agent with the highest valuation, which is Agent 2 with 79.
6. **Item 1:** Allocate to the agent with the highest valuation, which is Agent 1 with 31.

### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5, 0]

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5, 0]
}
