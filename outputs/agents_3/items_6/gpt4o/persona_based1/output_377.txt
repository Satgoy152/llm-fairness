Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2   7  91  55  66  37
1   5  68  72   1  61  99
2  50  63  62  44  31  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple algorithm like the "round-robin" method, where each agent picks their highest-valued item in turns until all items are allocated. This approach doesn't guarantee perfect envy-freeness but strives to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 0 selects item 2 (value 91).
   - Agent 1 selects item 5 (value 99).
   - Agent 2 selects item 1 (value 63).

2. **Round 2**:
   - Agent 0 selects item 4 (value 66).
   - Agent 1 selects item 3 (value 1).
   - Agent 2 selects item 0 (value 50).

Now, each agent has 2 items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1, 0]
}
```
