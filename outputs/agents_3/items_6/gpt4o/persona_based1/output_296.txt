Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  14   9  55   0  88
1  89  20  63  53  99  72
2  61   7   2  64  52   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation. This is generally challenging, but a practical approach is to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table of valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:**  
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 55
  - Item 4: 0
  - Item 5: 88

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 53
  - Item 4: 99
  - Item 5: 72

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 52
  - Item 5: 6

Given the goal of maximizing total valuations while achieving an envy-free allocation, let's go through a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 4** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (99). Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 5** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (88). Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (89). Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3** has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (64). Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (63). Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 1** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (20). Assign to Agent 1.

After this allocation, Agent 1 has received four items (0, 1, 2, 4), Agent 0 has received one item (5), and Agent 2 has received one item (3). Each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
