Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  74  33  87  81  52
1  12  40  24  37  52  81
2  38  90  22  35   7  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 74 33 87 81 52]
 [12 40 24 37 52 81]
 [38 90 22 35  7 84]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents, we aim to allocate the items in a way that ensures each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value, while also preventing envy. One common approach is to use the "maximum marginal value" method, which assigns items to agents based on their highest marginal utility or value.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [82, 74, 33, 87, 81, 52]
- Agent 1 values: [12, 40, 24, 37, 52, 81]
- Agent 2 values: [38, 90, 22, 35, 7, 84]

We will allocate items one by one based on the highest remaining valuation for each item.

1. Item 3 has the highest value of 87 from Agent 0.
2. Item 1 has the highest value of 90 from Agent 2.
3. Item 5 has the highest value of 81 from Agent 1.
4. Item 0 has the highest remaining value of 82 from Agent 0.
5. Item 4 has the highest remaining value of 81 from Agent 0.
6. Item 2 has the highest remaining value of 33 from Agent 0.

Now, let's assign the items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation aligns with their preferences based on their highest valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1]
}
```
