Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  29  70  67  52  54
1  77   6  59  48  91  43
2  96  39  83  28  56  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as the shares received by the others, according to their own valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 67
  - Item 4: 52
  - Item 5: 54

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 48
  - Item 4: 91
  - Item 5: 43

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 28
  - Item 4: 56
  - Item 5: 76

To achieve a fair allocation, let's try to allocate items in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while considering the overall distribution.

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (91), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (70), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. For item 5, Agent 2 values it the most (76), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
5. For item 3, Agent 0 values it second highest (67), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
6. For item 1, Agent 2 values it the highest remaining (39), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 1, and 5.

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
