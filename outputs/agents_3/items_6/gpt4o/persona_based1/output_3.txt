Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   1  81  91  21  91
1  37  65  26   0  46  56
2  71  72  22  63  19  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, while ensuring an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible with the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Let's review the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0 values: [59, 1, 81, 91, 21, 91]
- Agent 1 values: [37, 65, 26, 0, 46, 56]
- Agent 2 values: [71, 72, 22, 63, 19, 28]

One potential approach is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while trying to minimize envy. Here's one way to allocate:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 3 and 5 (both valued at 91).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 1 (65) and 5 (56).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 0 (71) and 1 (72).

2. **Allocate based on high-value preference, avoiding conflict:**
   - Agent 0 can receive items 3 and 2. (Total value = 91 + 81 = 172)
   - Agent 1 can receive items 1 and 4. (Total value = 65 + 46 = 111)
   - Agent 2 can receive items 0 and 5. (Total value = 71 + 28 = 99)

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's satisfaction given the constraints. Agent 1 doesn't get their highest-valued item (5), but receives item 1 which is highly valued, and another item (4) that adds to their total value significantly.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a substantial total value according to their preferences.
