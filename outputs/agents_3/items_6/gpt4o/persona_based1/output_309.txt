Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  56  34  53   9  48
1  55  48  50  33  52  65
2   1  57  30   0  51  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This problem can be approached by considering the agents' preferences and attempting to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 1 (56), 3 (53), and 5 (48). 
   - We can allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0, as they are among the highest valued for this agent.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values items 0 (55), 5 (65), and 4 (52).
   - We can allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 1, as they are among the highest valued for this agent.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 highly values items 1 (57), 5 (61), and 4 (51).
   - However, since items 1 and 5 are already allocated, we can allocate items 4 and 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation strives to balance the agents' preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 2.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives items and attempts to align with their highest preferences as closely as possible, given the constraints.
