Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  77   4  86  78   3
1  51  65  97  53  71  91
2  93  65  15  49  93   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 65 97 53 71 91]
 [93 65 15 49 93  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share, minimizing envy. This often involves considering each agent's preferences and trying to balance the distribution based on their valuations.

Given the valuation table:
- Agent 0 values: [33, 77, 4, 86, 78, 3]
- Agent 1 values: [51, 65, 97, 53, 71, 91]
- Agent 2 values: [93, 65, 15, 49, 93, 6]

A simple approach is to use a method like "round-robin" or "maximizing individual valuations" to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent in turn, ensuring each gets a chance to pick.**
2. **Reassess and allocate remaining items based on the highest remaining valuation.**

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 3 (86).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (97).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (93).

Next, we allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 4 (78).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 1 (65).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 5 (91).

Checking the allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

**Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
