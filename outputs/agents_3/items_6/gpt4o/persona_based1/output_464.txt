Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  53  72  50   2  42
1   2  91  97  88  62  34
2  53  50  71  90  98  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and striving for envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. We aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction relative to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 2 (72), Item 1 (53), Item 3 (50)
- Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 1 (91), Item 3 (88)
- Agent 2's highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 3 (90), Item 2 (71)

We will attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's perceived value while also keeping in mind the total distribution of items. We'll use a round-robin method, starting from the highest valued items and assigning them to the agents who value them the most.

1. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest (98).
2. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (97).
3. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the second highest (90).
4. Item 1: Agent 1 values it highly (91).
5. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest (29).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it relatively highly compared to others (42).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4

This allocation considers each agent's preferences while distributing the items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
