Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  39  90  93  53  24
1  81  76  31  91  14  85
2  33  43  67  43   9  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [81 76 31 91 14 85]
 [33 43 67 43  9 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to satisfy the principle of envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive whole items, and all items must be allocated.

First, let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 44 + 39 + 90 + 93 + 53 + 24 = 343
- Agent 1: 81 + 76 + 31 + 91 + 14 + 85 = 378
- Agent 2: 33 + 43 + 67 + 43 + 9 + 61 = 256

To achieve envy-freeness, each agent should ideally receive items such that they believe their share is at least as valuable as the shares received by others, based on their valuations. This isn't always perfectly achievable with integer allocations, but we aim for the closest possible.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High value on item 3 (93) and item 2 (90).
   - Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High value on item 0 (81) and item 1 (76).
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Remaining items are 4 and 5. 
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the total valuation of allocated items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 90 (item 2) + 93 (item 3) = 183
- Agent 1: 81 (item 0) + 76 (item 1) = 157
- Agent 2: 9 (item 4) + 61 (item 5) = 70

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent a selection of items they value relatively highly, even though perfect envy-freeness is not completely achievable given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
