Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  80  47  32  35  84
1  20  73  48  86  65  53
2  87  63  21  90  10  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 80 47 32 35 84]
 [20 73 48 86 65 53]
 [87 63 21 90 10 95]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for a division that is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. We need to consider each agent's valuation of the items to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 55, 80, 47, 32, 35, 84
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 20, 73, 48, 86, 65, 53
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: 87, 63, 21, 90, 10, 95

A common approach to find a fair allocation is to use a method like the "adjusted winner" procedure or a greedy algorithm based on maximizing total valuations while maintaining fairness.

Let's proceed with a heuristic allocation:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0's highest value is for item 5 (value 84)
   - Agent 1's highest value is for item 3 (value 86)
   - Agent 2's highest value is for item 5 (value 95)

2. Assign these highest-value items initially if possible without conflicts:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 since it is their highest value. Agent 0's next highest value is item 1 (value 80), and Agent 1's next highest value is item 3 (value 86).

3. Allocate remaining items to balance the distribution:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 80).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 86).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 87) since Agent 2 already has the highest valued item (item 5) and item 0 is their second-highest preference.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 47) to complete the allocation for Agent 0.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 65) to complete the allocation.

Here's the final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 5.

This distribution attempts to balance the valuations and provide each agent with high-value items according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
