Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  95  76  11  49  11
1  49  92  51  98  99   7
2  21  37  56  76  90  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 92 51 98 99  7]
 [21 37 56 76 90 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's share based on their preferences.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [41, 95, 76, 11, 49, 11]
- Agent 1 values: [49, 92, 51, 98, 99, 7]
- Agent 2 values: [21, 37, 56, 76, 90, 89]

One possible approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, potentially leading to an allocation where no agent envies another. Let's try to allocate the items to achieve this:

1. **Allocate item 1** to Agent 0, since they value it the most (95).
2. **Allocate item 4** to Agent 1, since they value it the most (99).
3. **Allocate item 5** to Agent 2, since they value it the most (89).

Now, consider the remaining items (0, 2, 3) and allocate them based on maximizing the remaining value for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

4. **Allocate item 2** to Agent 0, who values it second highest (76).
5. **Allocate item 3** to Agent 1, who values it second highest (98).
6. **Allocate item 0** to Agent 2, who values it next (21).

The final allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 5

This allocation attempts to balance the fairness by maximizing each agent's valuation and attempting to minimize envy, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
