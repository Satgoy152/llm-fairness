Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  60  75  85  94  92
1  37  67  26  85  93  74
2  94  34  11  42  10   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that ensures envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. This can be challenging with discrete items, but we can try to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 75 + 60 + 75 + 85 + 94 + 92 = 481
- Agent 1: 37 + 67 + 26 + 85 + 93 + 74 = 382
- Agent 2: 94 + 34 + 11 + 42 + 10 + 4 = 195

To minimize envy, we can use an approximate algorithm where each agent receives items that they value highly, given the constraints.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on their highest valued items.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 0 does not value as highly but still have good value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Since they have the lowest total valuation, prioritize giving them items they value highest.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Their highest valued item is 4 (94) and 5 (92). We allocate these to them.
- **Agent 1**: Their highest valued item is 4 (93), but since it's already allocated, we give them item 3 (85).
- **Agent 2**: Their highest valued item is 0 (94), which is not taken, so we allocate item 0 to them.

### Remaining Items:

- Items 1 and 2 are left. Allocate based on remaining preferences:
  - **Agent 0** can get item 1 (60), as they value it reasonably.
  - **Agent 1** gets item 2 (26) as it's the least valued by others.

This allocation tries to satisfy each agent's preferences to some degree while ensuring each gets at least one item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the value distribution and minimize envy by considering each agent's highest preferences.
