Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  75  80  34  25  94
1  66  18  52  63  65  82
2  59  72  99  58  52  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 18 52 63 65 82]
 [59 72 99 58 52 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent perceives their allocated bundle to be at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle. Since each agent has different valuations for the items, we'll attempt to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Agent\Item     0    1    2    3    4    5
Agent 0:      70   75   80   34   25   94
Agent 1:      66   18   52   63   65   82
Agent 2:      59   72   99   58   52   94
```

To find a fair division, we can start by considering the highest value allocations for each agent and then adjust to ensure each gets two items (since there are 6 items and 3 agents, each should ideally get 2 items).

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 5 (94) and 2 (80).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 5 (82) and 4 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 2 (99) and 5 (94).

Notice item 5 is highly valued by all agents. Let's try a different allocation to balance these:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as they have other high-value options.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, since it is their highest value.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their second highest value after 5.

Now, let's re-evaluate the allocations for remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Add item 0 (70) to get a high value item.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (63), which is reasonably valued.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (72), which they value highly.

Here's the proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Gets items 5 and 0.
- Agent 1: Gets items 4 and 3.
- Agent 2: Gets items 2 and 1.

This allocation should be reasonably fair, ensuring each agent receives a high-value item according to their own valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
