Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  13  64  12  13  54
1  11  85  52   6  22  31
2  49  50   2  42  76  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (73), 2 (64), 5 (54)

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (85), 2 (52), 5 (31)

3. **Agent 2's preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (76), 5 (60), 1 (50)

Given these preferences, I will allocate the items as follows while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
  - Value: 73 (item 0) + 64 (item 2) = 137
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 5
  - Value: 85 (item 1) + 31 (item 5) = 116
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 4
  - Value: 42 (item 3) + 76 (item 4) = 118

This allocation allows each agent to receive items that they value relatively highly, minimizing envy as much as possible given the discrete nature of the items and differing valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation distributes all 6 items and ensures that each agent receives at least one item, while aiming to minimize envy based on their given valuations.
