Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  76  25  83  46  43
1  87  52  92  25  53  78
2  50  72  21  65  11  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [50 72 21 65 11 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into account the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own. Given the valuations, we can use the following approach to make the allocation:

1. **List the total valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: 50 + 76 + 25 + 83 + 46 + 43 = 323
   - Agent 1: 87 + 52 + 92 + 25 + 53 + 78 = 387
   - Agent 2: 50 + 72 + 21 + 65 + 11 + 45 = 264

2. **Allocate based on maximizing each agent's utility while minimizing envy:**

We aim to distribute items in such a way that each agent's total perceived value is balanced and no agent envies another.

- Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences, while ensuring no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.
  
After reviewing the valuations, a possible allocation is:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 0 (values: 83 and 50)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 5 (values: 92 and 78)
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 4 (values: 72 and 11)

3. **Check allocations for envy-freeness:**
   - Agent 0 receives items worth 133 (83 + 50).
   - Agent 1 receives items worth 170 (92 + 78).
   - Agent 2 receives items worth 83 (72 + 11).

This allocation ensures that each agent has a reasonable share based on their preferences, although envy-freeness is quite complex to achieve perfectly with integer allocations.

Finally, present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers fairness and attempts to minimize envy, given the constraints.
