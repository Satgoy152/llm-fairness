Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  82  71  80  94  36
1  97  27  80  68  90  77
2  52  33   4  56  95  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the agents' utilities. This approach often leads to allocations that are both efficient and envy-free (or nearly so). Here's how we can go about it:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** Sum up the valuations each agent has for all the items to understand their total value perspective.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:** 
   - Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness:** 
   - Adjust allocations to minimize envy by swapping items if one agent values the other's item significantly more than their own.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest valued item: 4 (94)
  - Second highest: 3 (80)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valued item: 0 (97)
  - Second highest: 4 (90) - already allocated to Agent 0, so choose next:
  - Third highest: 5 (77)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest valued item: 4 (95) - already allocated
  - Next highest: 3 (56) - already allocated
  - Next highest: 0 (52) - already allocated
  - Next highest: 5 (35) - allocate
  - Allocate next highest items not already chosen by others: 1 (33)

**Final Adjustments:**
- Ensure all items are allocated, and no agent is left without a fair share. 

The final allocation after adjustments can be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items while trying to minimize envy based on their stated valuations.
