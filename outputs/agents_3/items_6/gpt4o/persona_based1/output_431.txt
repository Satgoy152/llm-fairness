Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  37  65  23  50  41
1  41  58  16  10  44   8
2  57  42  32  86   4  58
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 37 65 23 50 41]
 [41 58 16 10 44  8]
 [57 42 32 86  4 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another, given the constraints.

First, let's determine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 28 + 37 + 65 + 23 + 50 + 41 = 244
- Agent 1: 41 + 58 + 16 + 10 + 44 + 8 = 177
- Agent 2: 57 + 42 + 32 + 86 + 4 + 58 = 279

Next, we need to assign the items to agents in a way that aims for envy-freeness or fairness, while ensuring every agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

After analyzing the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, so we assign it to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest, so we assign it to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest, so we assign it to Agent 2.

Now, we have 3 more items to allocate (items 0, 4, and 5).

Considering the next best allocations:
- Agent 0 values item 0 second highest, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 5 quite highly, so we assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Finally, item 4 can be assigned to Agent 1 as it is the next highest remaining value for Agent 1.

Thus, each agent receives two items, and they are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, given the constraints of the problem.
