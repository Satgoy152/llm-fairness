Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  92  87  98  63  37
1  30   0  21  89   4   0
2  47   6  59   5  59  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 92 87 98 63 37]
 [30  0 21 89  4  0]
 [47  6 59  5 59 92]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an allocation where no agent envies another agent's allocation. This means that each agent should feel that the items they receive are at least as valuable to them as the items allocated to any other agent. We will use the valuations provided to determine a fair allocation.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [36, 92, 87, 98, 63, 37]
- Agent 1 values: [30, 0, 21, 89, 4, 0]
- Agent 2 values: [47, 6, 59, 5, 59, 92]

A common approach is to use the method of "maximum total valuation" where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. Item 0:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (47)

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (92)

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (87)

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (98)

5. Item 4:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (63)

6. Item 5:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (92)

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [0, 5]

Agent 1 hasn't received any items, which is not desirable. To improve the fairness, we could adjust the allocation so that Agent 1 receives at least one item. We will re-evaluate the allocation for a fairer distribution.

Revised allocation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 2 (47)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 (92)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 (21)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 (98)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 (59)

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 1 (0)

Revised allocation gives:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]

This revised distribution ensures that all agents receive items, aiming for a more balanced and envy-free allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
