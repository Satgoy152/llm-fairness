Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  22  67  84  13  27
1  76  78  77  44  39  55
2  61  94   9  12  67  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items in a manner that satisfies these conditions to the extent possible.

Here's a step-by-step procedure to find a reasonable allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying which agent values each item the most. This gives a preliminary indication of potential allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (76).
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (67).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (67).
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (55).

3. **Adjust for Fairness and Completeness:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item and adjust allocations to balance total valuations.
   - Avoid giving all high-value items to one agent to prevent excessive envy.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Considering the above points, a fair allocation could be:
     - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
     - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5.
     - Agent 2 gets items 1 and 4.

5. **Verify Allocation:**
   - Check if the allocation uses all items and whether the distribution is as balanced as possible.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a manner that respects the highest individual valuations while trying to maintain a balance among the agents, potentially minimizing envy.
