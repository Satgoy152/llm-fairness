Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  19  11  36  19  98
1  16  10  50  26  22  14
2   6  42  54  95   9   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6 42 54 95  9  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and integer allocations, we will attempt to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to minimize the differences in perceived value each agent receives, striving for an allocation where each agent feels they have received an equitable share.

### Valuations:

- Agent 0: [74, 19, 11, 36, 19, 98]
- Agent 1: [16, 10, 50, 26, 22, 14]
- Agent 2: [6, 42, 54, 95, 9, 5]

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 98)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 50)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 95)

2. **Assign the High-Value Items:**
   - Give Item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Give Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Give Item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 4.
   - Calculate the total value for each agent after the initial allocation:
     - Agent 0: 98 (Item 5)
     - Agent 1: 50 (Item 2)
     - Agent 2: 95 (Item 3)

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Total Value:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 highly (74), so give Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Give Item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation after Item 3).
   - Give Item 4 to Agent 1 (balances valuations, as Agent 1 has the lowest total value).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3]

This allocation strives to achieve a fair division based on the given valuations, minimizing envy by allocating items each agent values highly and balancing the overall perceived value.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
