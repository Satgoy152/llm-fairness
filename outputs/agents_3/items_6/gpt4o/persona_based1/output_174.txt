Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  40  28   0  13  64
1  50  81  10  77  37  87
2   5   5  60  37  74   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, while also ensuring that the distribution is envy-free. Given the valuations provided, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the situation and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Highest: Item 5 (64)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (40)
   - Third highest: Item 2 (28)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Highest: Item 5 (87)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (81)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (77)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - Highest: Item 4 (74)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (60)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (37)

Given these valuations:

- **Item 5** is highly valued by both Agents 0 and 1. However, Agent 1 values it the most, so we allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** is also highly valued by Agent 1. Agent 1 can take Item 1 as well since Agent 0 can still have a good allocation with other items.
- **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 2, so it's best to allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Item 2** is valued by both Agents 0 and 2. However, Agent 2 values it more, so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3** is next most valued by Agent 1, followed by Agent 2. However, since Agent 2 has already received two items, we should allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 0** is primarily valued by Agent 0, so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and it minimizes envy across agents.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed accordingly.
