Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96   1  62  13  17  55
1  69  96  84  64  42  52
2  80  66  30  94  14  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96  1 62 13 17 55]
 [69 96 84 64 42 52]
 [80 66 30 94 14 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [96, 1, 62, 13, 17, 55]
Agent 1: [69, 96, 84, 64, 42, 52]
Agent 2: [80, 66, 30, 94, 14, 28]
```

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to maximize the minimum satisfaction (or value) that each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction and minimize envy.

Let's carry out the allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (96), and no other agent values it as highly.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (96), and no other agent values it as highly.

3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (94), and no other agent values it as highly.

4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the second-highest value for item 2 (84), which is better than what other agents can achieve with their remaining items.

5. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the second-highest value for item 5 (55), which is better than what other agents can achieve with their remaining items.

6. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the third-highest value for item 4 (42), which maximizes their overall satisfaction given the remaining options.

Based on this allocation strategy, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.

This allocation should be fair as each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations under the given constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
