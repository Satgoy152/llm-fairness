Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  61  22  56  46  91
1  87   8  38  53  80  20
2  13  84  81  56  21  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for every item. The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 0 (93) and item 5 (91). Among the available items, these are significantly more valued by Agent 0 than others.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 (80) highly and item 0 (87) the highest, but item 0 is already highly coveted by Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 (84) and item 2 (81) the highest.

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** should get items that they value highly, preferably their highest, which are items 0 and 5.
- **Agent 1** should get one of their most valued items that is not a major conflict with Agent 0. Item 4 is a good candidate.
- **Agent 2** should receive items 1 and 2 because they value these the most without major conflicts.

Now we have allocated 5 items. The remaining item is item 3, which has equal valuation by both Agent 0 and Agent 2. Since Agent 2 already has two items, let's give item 3 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items among agents.

The allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 2

This allocation balances the high valuations and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
