Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  35  15  77  83  56
1  63  51  69  80  45  61
2  32  90  16  70  30  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. A common method to achieve this is to use the maximum marginal value strategy, where each agent is allocated the item that they value the most among the remaining unallocated items.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (90), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (83), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (80), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. Now, we look at the remaining items: 0, 2, and 5.

5. **Agent 0** values item 0 the second highest (38), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 2** values item 5 the second highest (65), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 1** values item 2 the second highest (69), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
