Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  94  75  88  23  61
1  42  37  42  35  12  62
2  90  51  60  68  98  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or the maximin share approach. Here, I'll use a simple heuristic to demonstrate one possible allocation that aims to minimize envy and fairly distribute the items:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 96 + 94 + 75 + 88 + 23 + 61 = 437
- Agent 1: 42 + 37 + 42 + 35 + 12 + 62 = 230
- Agent 2: 90 + 51 + 60 + 68 + 98 + 40 = 407

### Step 2: Item Allocation
We'll aim to allocate items such that the distribution is as balanced as possible with respect to each agent's total valuation.

#### Allocation Strategy:
- Allocate high-value items to the agent who values them the most and aim for balance in total value received by each agent.

1. **Item 0**: Valuations are [96, 42, 90]. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 4**: Valuations are [23, 12, 98]. Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 1**: Valuations are [94, 37, 51]. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 5**: Valuations are [61, 62, 40]. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 2**: Valuations are [75, 42, 60]. Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 3**: Valuations are [88, 35, 68]. Allocate to Agent 2.

### Step 3: Resulting Allocation
After this allocation strategy, we have the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4

### JSON Format Output
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives based on their valuations, while each agent ends up with at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.
