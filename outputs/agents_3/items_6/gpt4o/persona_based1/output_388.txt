Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  36   9  47   7  72
1  45  99  83  72  22   9
2  70  89  23  74  96  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [70 89 23 74 96 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the objective of achieving envy-freeness, we want to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, especially given that we have to allocate exactly 6 items among the 3 agents.

Let's evaluate the valuations by each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [9, 36, 9, 47, 7, 72]
- Agent 1 values: [45, 99, 83, 72, 22, 9]
- Agent 2 values: [70, 89, 23, 74, 96, 52]

To begin, we can allocate items based on the highest valuation for each agent while trying to maintain balance:

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (72).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (99).
3. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as they value it the highest (96).

Now we have allocated 3 items. Let's continue by considering the next highest valuations left:

4. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (83) and Agent 0 values it low (9), Agent 2 values it (23).
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it highly (74) and Agent 1 values it (72), Agent 0 values it (47).
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it higher (9) than Agent 1 (45), and lower than Agent 2 (70), but it completes the allocation.

This allocation should minimize envy as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and it attempts to balance the valuations each agent places on the items they receive.
