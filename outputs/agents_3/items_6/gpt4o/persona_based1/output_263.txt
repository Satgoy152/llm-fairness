Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  22  76  21  45  92
1  62  22  30  98  45  10
2  53  28  91  68  47  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45 22 76 21 45 92]
 [62 22 30 98 45 10]
 [53 28 91 68 47 28]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  22  76  21  45  92
1  62  22  30  98  45  10
2  53  28  91  68  47  28
```

We can attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items maximizing their total valuation while minimizing envy among agents.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (92)
   - Next highest value item: Item 2 (76)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (98)
   - Next highest value item: Item 0 (62)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (91)
   - Next highest value item: Item 3 (68)

Given that items 2 and 3 are desired by multiple agents, we need to adjust to avoid conflicts and ensure all items are allocated.

Allocating based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while avoiding conflicts:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0, left unclaimed by others at this point)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (highest valuation by Agent 2, left unclaimed by others due to preceding assignment)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1, left unclaimed by others due to preceding assignments)

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 1, and 4:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation, and not claimed by others)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation, and not claimed by others)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (only remaining unclaimed item)

This allocation results in:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. This distribution seeks to maximize each agent's total valuation while minimizing envy.
