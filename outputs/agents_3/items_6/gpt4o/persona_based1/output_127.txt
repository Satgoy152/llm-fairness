Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  75  54  21  27  84
1  10  46  41  95  90  65
2  47   7  16  83  64  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations for each item, we can attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation. While it can be challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness in discrete settings, we can use a heuristic approach to get close to it.

We'll aim to maximize the total utility for each agent by checking which items have the highest valuation for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest preference for item 5 (value 84).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest preference for item 3 (value 95).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest preference for item 0 (value 47).

Next, allocate the remaining items to further balance the satisfaction:

- **Agent 0:** Also gets item 4 (value 27).
- **Agent 1:** Also gets items 1 (value 46).
- **Agent 2:** Also gets item 2 (value 16).

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```
