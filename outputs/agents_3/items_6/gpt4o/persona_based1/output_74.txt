Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  97  16   6  68  16
1  68  63   9  64   6  86
2  29  28  33  72  93  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [68 63  9 64  6 86]
 [29 28 33 72 93 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division, where each agent believes they have received the most valuable set of items according to their own valuation. Given the valuations, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0** values items 0 and 1 the most, and they'll get those.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 the most, and they'll get that.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the most, and they'll get that.

Let's distribute the remaining items (2 and 3) to further maximize each agent's perceived value:

- **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (64), so they will receive item 3.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 more than agent 0, so they will receive item 2.

This yields the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]

This allocation attempts to satisfy the principles of fair division, ensuring each agent receives items they value highly relative to their other options.

Final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
