Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  69  94  11  41   2
1  89  19  13   3  54  69
2  35  64  81   8  60  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

Let's start by examining the matrix of valuations for each agent:

```
        Items
        0  1  2  3  4  5
Agents
  0:   1 69 94 11 41  2
  1:  89 19 13  3 54 69
  2:  35 64 81  8 60 90
```

The goal is to allocate each item to one of the agents such that the distribution is as fair as possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize each agent's share of their total valuation.

Let's compute the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(1 + 69 + 94 + 11 + 41 + 2 = 218\)
- Agent 1: \(89 + 19 + 13 + 3 + 54 + 69 = 247\)
- Agent 2: \(35 + 64 + 81 + 8 + 60 + 90 = 338\)

Next, we want to allocate items to maximize the value each agent perceives. One potential allocation strategy is:

- Assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item relative to the other agents.

Following this strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 1 (89)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 0 (69)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (94)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (11)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 2 (60)
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 2 (90)

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3]
  - Total value = 69 + 94 + 11 = 174
- Agent 1: Item [0]
  - Total value = 89
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
  - Total value = 60 + 90 = 150

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some items and the distribution is envy-free to the degree possible given the constraints. 

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
