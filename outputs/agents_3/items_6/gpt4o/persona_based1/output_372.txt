Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  60   9  33  32  18
1  56  17  88  14  55  87
2  54  67  81  28  58  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 17 88 14 55 87]
 [54 67 81 28 58 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent more than their own bundle based on their valuations.

First, let's consider each agent's total valuation of all items:

- Agent 0: 29 + 60 + 9 + 33 + 32 + 18 = 181
- Agent 1: 56 + 17 + 88 + 14 + 55 + 87 = 317
- Agent 2: 54 + 67 + 81 + 28 + 58 + 87 = 375

Next, let's try to allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance these valuations across the three agents. We will check different combinations and try to minimize envy.

Based on the valuations, it appears that Agent 1 and Agent 2 value items 2 and 5 highly, whereas Agent 0 does not. Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 1 compared to other items. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- Give item 1 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values this at 60, which is the highest among all items for them.
- Give item 2 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values this at 88, which is the highest among all items for them.
- Give item 5 to Agent 2: Agent 2 values this at 87, which is the highest among all items for them.
- Allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 4) in a way that maintains balance:

    - Give item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 56 by them)
    - Give item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 33 by them)
    - Give item 4 to Agent 2 (valued at 58 by them)

This allocation attempts to ensure that the total value each agent receives is balanced and minimizes envy.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the total number of items is six, as required.
