Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  57  52  54  34  64
1  25  19  90  63  75  26
2   9  58   3  72  32  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims for envy-freeness among the agents, we can employ strategies such as maximizing the total utility and ensuring that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their preferences. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion when perfect envy-freeness is not possible due to indivisibility.

Let's implement a solution step-by-step:

1. **Assign high-valued items to agents who value them most:** This helps in minimizing envy from the start.

2. **Check for remaining items and assign them to balance allocations:** Ensure every agent receives at least one item if possible, and try to balance the values.

Using these strategies, let's distribute the items:

- **Item 5** (value 93 for Agent 2) is highly valued by Agent 2 and should go to Agent 2.
- **Item 2** (value 90 for Agent 1) is highly valued by Agent 1 and should go to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** (value 58 for Agent 2) is also highly valued by Agent 2.
- **Item 4** (value 75 for Agent 1) is highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Item 3** (value 54 for Agent 0) is relatively high for Agent 0.
- **Item 0** (value 23 for Agent 0) is assigned to Agent 0 to ensure all items are allocated.

This distribution maximizes each agent's high-value items while trying to keep the allocation balanced.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5.

Each agent gets two items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning high-valued items to the agents who value them the most.
