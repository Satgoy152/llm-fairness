Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77  84  38  75  10  18
1  13  83  31  57  24   2
2  35   3  12  49  57  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure an envy-free distribution or as close to it as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we'll analyze and attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (84)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (77)
   - Allocate items 1 and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (83) - already taken by Agent 0
   - Second highest valuation: Item 3 (57)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (57)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

After the above allocations, items 2 and 5 remain unallocated. Let's distribute them by considering remaining item values:

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2:
     - Agent 0: 38
     - Agent 1: 31
     - Agent 2: 12
     - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
   
   - Item 5:
     - Agent 0: 18
     - Agent 1: 2
     - Agent 2: 10
     - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and the most value, but it should be noted that achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations is challenging in this situation due to the disparate valuations.

Finally, the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4]
}
```
