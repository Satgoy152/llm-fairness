Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95   8  35  36  68  50
1  62  85  65  46  16   5
2  73  17  71  18  97   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items to agents in a way that is fair, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own. We will try to allocate items considering the valuations to achieve this goal.

Given the valuations, we can try an allocation strategy by iteratively assigning the highest-valued unallocated item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest value for item 0 (95), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest value for item 1 (85), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Has the highest value for item 4 (97), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0:** Has the next highest value for item 2 (35), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2:** Has the next highest value for item 3 (18), so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 0:** Has the next highest value for item 5 (50), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and aims to reduce potential envy by prioritizing high valuations. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all six items, ensuring that each agent receives items they highly value, which helps in minimizing envy.
