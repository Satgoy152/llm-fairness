Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  50  44  86  45  93
1  75   6  51  35  33  76
2  30  50  18  23  42  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 50 18 23 42 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 5 (value 93).
   - Second highest is item 3 (value 86).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 75).
   - Next highest is item 5 (value 76), but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we move to item 2 (value 51).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 1 (value 50).
   - Next highest is item 5 (value 56), but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we move to item 4 (value 42).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, albeit not perfectly envy-free.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
