Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  61  88  34  27  27
1  64  30  47  49   2  77
2  32  30  64  72  63  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 61 88 34 27 27]
 [64 30 47 49  2 77]
 [32 30 64 72 63 14]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures fairness. We can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their valuations, which helps in achieving envy-freeness to the extent possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 97, 61, 88, 34, 27, 27
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 64, 30, 47, 49, 2, 77
- Agent 2 values items as follows: 32, 30, 64, 72, 63, 14

To ensure fairness and maximize individual utility, we can follow a strategy where each agent gets the item they value the most first, then proceed to allocate remaining items.

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (97), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (77), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (72), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

4. For Agent 0, the next highest valued item is item 2 (88), allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
5. The next highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 3, but it's already taken, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
6. The next highest value available for Agent 2 is item 4 (63), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Finally, we have one item left, item 1, which can be allocated to Agent 0 as it provides a decent value (61).

The final allocation of items is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, and 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
