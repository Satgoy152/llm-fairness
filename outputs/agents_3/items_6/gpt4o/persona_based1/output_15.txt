Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  45  13   7  91  39
1  52  63  76  35  14  27
2  14   3   4   3  65  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use techniques such as maximizing the total utility or ensuring that each agent receives items that have the highest value to them relative to other agents. In this case, we will attempt to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy between the agents.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items one by one:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - Agent 2 values it at 14.
   - Since Agent 0 values it the highest, assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 45.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Agent 2 values it at 3.
   - Since Agent 1 values it the highest, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 13.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Agent 2 values it at 4.
   - Since Agent 1 values it the highest, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 7.
   - Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Agent 2 values it at 3.
   - Since Agent 1 values it the highest, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 91.
   - Agent 1 values it at 14.
   - Agent 2 values it at 65.
   - Since Agent 0 values it the highest, assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 39.
   - Agent 1 values it at 27.
   - Agent 2 values it at 18.
   - Since Agent 0 values it the highest, assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 has items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 2 has no items.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the utility for each agent based on their valuations, ensuring that the agents receive items they value most highly.
