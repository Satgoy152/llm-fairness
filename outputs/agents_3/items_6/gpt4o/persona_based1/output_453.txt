Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  18  13  60  22  54
1  21  49  16  72  52  35
2  36  11  90  65  12  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations of each item by each agent. We'll employ a method that ensures each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, if possible.

First, let's summarize the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [28, 18, 13, 60, 22, 54]
- Agent 1's valuations: [21, 49, 16, 72, 52, 35]
- Agent 2's valuations: [36, 11, 90, 65, 12, 69]

We'll attempt to allocate items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with what they receive. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate the highest valued available item to the agent who values it most.** This approach is straightforward and often helps in achieving a fair distribution.

2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible**, given there are six items and three agents.

Now, let's allocate the items step by step:

- Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (value 90). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Item 3 has the next highest valuation from Agent 1 (value 72). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Item 5 has the next highest valuation from Agent 2 (value 69). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Item 0 has the next highest valuation from Agent 2 (value 36). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Item 4 has the next highest valuation from Agent 1 (value 52). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Item 1 has the next highest valuation from Agent 1 (value 49). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we check the number of items each agent has received:

- Agent 0 has received 0 items.
- Agent 1 has received 3 items.
- Agent 2 has received 3 items.

To ensure each agent has at least one item, we can make a slight adjustment:

- Reallocate item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has a stronger preference for item 3.

Final allocation after adjustment:

- Agent 0: items [4]
- Agent 1: items [1, 3]
- Agent 2: items [0, 2, 5]

This ensures an integer allocation of items to each agent with an attempt to maintain envy-freeness.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
