Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  24  60  98   7  91
1  51  66  92  59  39  68
2  30  59  29  14   5  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 66 92 59 39 68]
 [30 59 29 14  5 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy and maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations. One common approach is the "maximum envy-free allocation" or a similar heuristic that results in a reasonably fair division of items.

Let's evaluate a suitable allocation for this scenario:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest (98) and item 5 next (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest (92) and item 1 next (66).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the highest (59).

We should try to allocate items so that each agent receives items that they value highly. Here is one potential fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 3 and 5. (These have high values for Agent 0: 98 and 91 respectively)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 2 and 1. (These have high values for Agent 1: 92 and 66 respectively)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 0 and 4. (These have relatively higher values for Agent 2: 30 and 5 respectively)

This allocation gives each agent items they value highly relative to their own preferences, and it assigns all 6 items.

Here is the allocation presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
