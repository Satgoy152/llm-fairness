Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  84  92  51  31  26
1  27  22  86  69  58  24
2  17   8  95  89  25  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and attempt to minimize envy. A fair allocation should ideally be envy-free, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. 

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
    - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
    - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 and a moderate valuation for item 3.
    - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, followed by item 3.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
    - Since item 2 is highly valued by all agents, we should carefully decide who gets it to minimize overall envy.
    - Allocate item 2 to agent 2 as it has the highest valuation for it.
    - Allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 0, since they are highly valued by them and not as highly valued by others.
    - Allocate item 3 to agent 1, as it is their second highest valued item.
    - Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as it is moderately valued by them and less valued by others.
    - Allocate item 5 to agent 2, as it completes their allocation and is less contentious.

3. **Final Allocation**:
    - Agent 0: Items 0, 1
    - Agent 1: Items 3, 4
    - Agent 2: Items 2, 5

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their higher valued items and ensuring that the distribution respects their preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
