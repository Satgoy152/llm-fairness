Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  41  63  92  69  57
1  33  86  52  68  95  38
2   7  67   1  40  14  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 67  1 40 14 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, given the constraints. One approach is to use a round-robin method based on each agent's highest valuation for unallocated items. 

First, let's examine each agent's highest valuation to determine an initial allocation:  

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 92.  
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 95.  
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 67.  

Let's begin by allocating these items to each agent:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's see what items remain: 0, 2, 5. We continue allocating the remaining items in a similar fashion by considering each agent's highest valuation for the remaining items. 

For item 0:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 31.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 33.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 7.

Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 as they value it the most.

For item 2:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 63.
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 52.
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 1.

Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as they value it the most.

For item 5:

- Agent 0 values item 5 at 57.
- Agent 1 values item 5 at 38.
- Agent 2 values item 5 at 30.

Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 as they value it the most.

Now, each agent has been assigned as follows:

- Agent 0: items 3, 2, 5
- Agent 1: items 4, 0
- Agent 2: item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1]
}
```
