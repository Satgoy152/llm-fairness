Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89   4  59  74  42  74
1   2  17  64   3  39  47
2  11  90  69  50  28  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy and tries to achieve fairness.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [89, 4, 59, 74, 42, 74]
- Agent 1: [2, 17, 64, 3, 39, 47]
- Agent 2: [11, 90, 69, 50, 28, 25]

First, let's consider allocating the highest valued items for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item is 0 (89)
   - Next highest is 3 (74) and 5 (74)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item is 2 (64)
   - Next highest is 5 (47) and 4 (39)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item is 1 (90)
   - Next highest is 2 (69)

Now let's assign items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 5) while maintaining fairness:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (as it's one of their higher valued items).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (as it's their third highest valued item).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (as it has the same value as item 3 for Agent 0, and it prevents overloading Agent 1).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one of their higher valued items, and the distribution attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
