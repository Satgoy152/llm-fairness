Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  11   4  62  58   1
1  59   4  84  64  67  75
2  93  46  98  35  36  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 11  4 62 58  1]
 [59  4 84 64 67 75]
 [93 46 98 35 36 60]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility, aiming to allocate items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their received goods, given their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values items: [58, 11, 4, 62, 58, 1]
   - Agent 1 values items: [59, 4, 84, 64, 67, 75]
   - Agent 2 values items: [93, 46, 98, 35, 36, 60]

2. **Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 3 (62).
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (84).
   - Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 2 (98).

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Agent 1 and Agent 2 both highly value item 2; however, Agent 2 values it more (98 vs. 84). We assign item 2 to Agent 2 to minimize overall envy.

4. **Allocate Items Based on Remaining High Valuations:**
   - After item 2:
     - Agent 0: Assign item 3 (62) (highest remaining for Agent 0).
     - Agent 1: Assign item 5 (75) (highest remaining for Agent 1).
     - Agent 2: Already assigned item 2.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 4.
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 0 (58).
   - Agent 1: Next highest is item 4 (67).
   - Agent 2: Next highest is item 5 (already taken), but item 1 can be chosen (46).

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 3]
   - Agent 1: [4, 5]
   - Agent 2: [1, 2]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a focus on reducing envy where possible.
