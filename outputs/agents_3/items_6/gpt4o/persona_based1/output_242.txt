Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  21  31  61  16  31
1   6   5  65  96  29  42
2  28  50  77   8  31  16
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness among the agents, we need to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations. One approach we can use is to apply the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion. This criterion ensures that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than the value of a single item.

Let's evaluate and construct a potential allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent:**

   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Highest valued item is 3 (value 61).
   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Highest valued item is 3 (value 96), but it’s already assigned.
     - Next highest: 2 (value 65).
   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Highest valued item is 2 (value 77), but it’s already assigned.
     - Next highest: 1 (value 50).

2. **Proceed with next best options for each agent:**

   - **Agent 0**:
     - Next highest: 0 (value 49).
   - **Agent 1**:
     - Next highest: 3 (value 96, already taken), then 5 (value 42).
   - **Agent 2**:
     - Next highest: 1 (value 50, already taken), then 0 (value 28, already taken), then 4 (value 31).

3. **Continue assigning remaining items:**

   - Remaining items: 
     - For Agent 0: 1, 2 (already taken).
     - For Agent 1: 4.
     - For Agent 2: 3, 5 (already taken).

4. **Final allocation attempt:**

   - **Agent 0**: [3, 0]
   - **Agent 1**: [2, 5]
   - **Agent 2**: [1, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and no agent has more than one item of envy over another's allocation.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
