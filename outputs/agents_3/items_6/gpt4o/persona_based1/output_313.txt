Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  59  34  84  14  19
1  62  52  77  95  15  45
2  75  57  46  93  55  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, which means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the others from their own perspective. We will use the envy-free up to one item (EF1) criterion, which is a relaxed version of envy-freeness, as a guideline in this allocation.

Given the valuations of the agents for the items, let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Highest valued items: 3 (84), 1 (59)
    - Allocating item 3 to Agent 0 as it's their highest valued item.

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest valued items: 3 (95), 2 (77)
    - Item 3 is already allocated, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest valued items: 0 (75), 3 (93), 4 (55)
    - Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 as it's their highest valued available item.

At this point, each agent has received one highly valued item according to their preferences.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Remaining Items**: 1, 4, 5

4. **Agent 0**:
    - Next highest valued item: 1 (59)
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 1**:
    - Next highest valued item: 4 (15)
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 2**:
    - Next highest valued item: 5 (36)
    - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocations that attempt to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives two items, ensuring all items are allocated and considering the agents' valuations to minimize envy.
