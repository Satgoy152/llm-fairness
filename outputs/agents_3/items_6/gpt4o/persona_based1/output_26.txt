Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  99  98  50  85   4
1  76  38  43  50  62  58
2  21  65  81   8  56   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

We'll look at the individual valuations and attempt to distribute items in such a way that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. One common method to achieve this is to start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, and then proceed with the remaining items.

Let's examine the valuations and determine the optimal allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 53.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it equally at 50.
   - Assign to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 58.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

Now we have the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: No items (but must be included in the JSON format).

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value the highest, while Agent 1 receives the next set of valuable items. Agent 2 does not get any items due to their lower valuations across the board compared to the other agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": []
}
```
