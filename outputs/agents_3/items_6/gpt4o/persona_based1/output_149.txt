Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  84  41  45  13  42
1  97   9  12  54  64  33
2  15  79  25  95   6  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97  9 12 54 64 33]
 [15 79 25 95  6 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to examine the given valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 60, 84, 41, 45, 13, 42
- Agent 1: 97, 9, 12, 54, 64, 33
- Agent 2: 15, 79, 25, 95, 6, 92

To achieve a fair division, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's lowest perceived value (minimizing envy).

### Proposed Allocation:
1. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (84) for item 1, which is significantly higher than other items they value.
2. **Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97), and item 4 (64) is also valued highly by them compared to other agents.
3. **Allocate items 3, 5, and 2 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (95) and item 5 next highest (92). Item 2, while not highly valued by Agent 2, is not strongly desired by others, allowing for a less envious distribution.

This allocation provides each agent with their most valued items, reducing potential envy.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
