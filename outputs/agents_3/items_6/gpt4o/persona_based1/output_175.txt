Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  18  84  10  65   4
1  62  47   4  27  20  95
2  96  16  86  17  73  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 18 84 10 65  4]
 [62 47  4 27 20 95]
 [96 16 86 17 73 62]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with exactly two items, as there are three agents and six items in total. The goal is to achieve a fair division of items such that it is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest valued items for Agent 0 are items 2 (value of 84) and 0 (value of 66).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest valued items for Agent 1 are items 5 (value of 95) and 0 (value of 62). However, item 0 is already better suited for Agent 0, so we consider the next highest available values.
   - Items 5 (value of 95) and 1 (value of 47) are the next best for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest valued items for Agent 2 are items 0 (value of 96) and 2 (value of 86). But since these are already efficiently allocated to Agent 0 and Agent 0, we should consider the next highest values.
   - Items 4 (value of 73) and 3 (value of 17) are the next best available for Agent 2.

Given these considerations, here is a possible allocation that could maximize fairness and total valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, maximizing their respective valuations given the constraints. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
