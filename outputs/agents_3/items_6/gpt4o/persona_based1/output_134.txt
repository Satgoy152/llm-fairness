Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  37  61  44  96  76
1  70  41  26  98  59  12
2  85  95   9  45  49  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 41 26 98 59 12]
 [85 95  9 45 49 74]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. Given the constraints and valuations, we will proceed with the allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0, 2, and 5 are left to be allocated.

4. **Further Allocation Based on Remaining Values:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 1 (70), next is Agent 2 (85), and least is Agent 0 (2).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values it highly.
   
   - Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 0 (61), next is Agent 1 (26), and least is Agent 2 (9).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it much higher than the others.
   
   - Item 5: Highest value is for Agent 0 (76), next is Agent 2 (74), and least is Agent 1 (12).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it slightly higher than Agent 2, and Agent 1 values it least.

### Final Allocation:

After these considerations, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the valuation constraints, ensuring that each agent receives items they value relatively more, while also ensuring all items are allocated.
