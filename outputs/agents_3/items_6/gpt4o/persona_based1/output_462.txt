Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   8  26  59  95  34
1   3  70  65  99  41  95
2  33   6  65  17  84  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize a method that balances the valuations among the agents. We can start by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent ends up with an approximately equal total value, if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuation while keeping the distribution fair.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [73, 8, 26, 59, 95, 34]
- Agent 1: [3, 70, 65, 99, 41, 95]
- Agent 2: [33, 6, 65, 17, 84, 60]

We aim to allocate the items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation:

1. **Assign item 4 to Agent 0**: It has the highest value of 95 for Agent 0.
2. **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: It has the highest value of 99 for Agent 1.
3. **Assign item 5 to Agent 1**: It has the highest remaining value of 95 for Agent 1.
4. **Assign item 2 to Agent 2**: It has the highest value of 65 for Agent 2.
5. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0**: It has the highest remaining value of 73 for Agent 0.
6. **Assign item 1 to Agent 2**: It has the remaining highest value of 6 for Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent, ensuring a fair division:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 5]
- Agent 2 receives items [1, 2]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, reducing envy among the agents.
