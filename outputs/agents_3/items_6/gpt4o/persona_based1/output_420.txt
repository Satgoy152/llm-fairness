Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  96  94  99  11  69
1  36  31  81  14  61  75
2  75   7  54  64  67  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 96 94 99 11 69]
 [36 31 81 14 61 75]
 [75  7 54 64 67 12]]
Output:
To allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents fairly, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This often involves maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

First, let's examine the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [34, 96, 94, 99, 11, 69]
- Agent 1: [36, 31, 81, 14, 61, 75]
- Agent 2: [75, 7, 54, 64, 67, 12]

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll allocate items based on maximizing individual total valuations while ensuring no envy among agents. A greedy approach is often a good start: allocate the item with the highest value for each agent in turns until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 3 (99)
   - Next highest value: Item 1 (96)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (75)
   - Next highest value: Item 4 (61)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (75)
   - Next highest value: Item 2 (54)

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a combination of items that maximizes their total valuation while minimizing envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the 3 agents and attempts to minimize envy based on their valuations.
