Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  80  21  26  25  83
1  20   1  83  10  98  11
2  13  42   6  96  85  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [20  1 83 10 98 11]
 [13 42  6 96 85 76]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that ensures envy-freeness to the extent possible with integer allocations, we will aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraint of allocating all items, we'll consider each agent's preferences and attempt to balance the allocations.

### Agents' Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 
  - High values for items 1 and 5.
- **Agent 1:** 
  - High value for item 4.
- **Agent 2:** 
  - High value for items 3 and 5.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Assign item 4 to Agent 1:** This maximizes Agent 1's value since they rate it highly at 98.
2. **Assign item 5 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values this item at 76, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for item 5.
3. **Assign item 3 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values this item at 96, which is the highest valuation among all agents for item 3.
4. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item at 80, which is their second-highest value.
5. **Assign item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item at 76, which is their third-highest value after item 1.
6. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item at 83, which is their highest remaining value after item 4.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items among the agents based on their preferences, maximizing the total satisfaction while ensuring that all items are allocated.
