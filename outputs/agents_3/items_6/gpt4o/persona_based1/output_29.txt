Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  79  39  37  51  74
1  39  42  14  15  76  14
2  86  62   6  31  75  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes items in a balanced manner. The goal is to ensure each agent feels that they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(6 + 79 + 39 + 37 + 51 + 74 = 286\)
- Agent 1: \(39 + 42 + 14 + 15 + 76 + 14 = 200\)
- Agent 2: \(86 + 62 + 6 + 31 + 75 + 96 = 356\)

Next, we will try to distribute the items in such a way that the perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation for item 1 (79), it would make sense to allocate that to them. Additionally, item 4 has a relatively high value (51) for them. Thus, we assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 4 (76), but since that is already assigned, we look at item 0 (39) and item 1 (42) as the next highest. Assigning item 0 to Agent 1 seems reasonable since it was not taken by Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 (86), 5 (96), and 4 (75). Since item 0 is already assigned, assigning items 5 (96) and 3 (31) to Agent 2 balances out their allocation, making sure they receive high-value items in their view.

After these assignments, we need to check if all items are allocated:

- Item 0: Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 2
- Item 4: Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 2

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that maximize their perceived value, maintaining a sense of fairness.

Let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 3]
}
```
