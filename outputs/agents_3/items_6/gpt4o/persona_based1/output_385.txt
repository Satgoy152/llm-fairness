Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  94  46  96  95  11
1  18  57   2  32  74  68
2  43  17  97   7  30  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach attempts to ensure that each agent gets the most valuable bundle possible given the constraints.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 65.
   
2. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 96, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.

3. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 74.

4. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 61.

5. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 94, which is the highest value for this item among all agents.

6. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 97.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item they value highly, aiming to minimize envy among the agents. Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
