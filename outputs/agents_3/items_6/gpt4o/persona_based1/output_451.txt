Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  41  25  99  57  16
1  81  86  12  89  72  17
2  42  53  29  94  49  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. We'll take a look at each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [64, 41, 25, 99, 57, 16]
- Agent 1: [81, 86, 12, 89, 72, 17]
- Agent 2: [42, 53, 29, 94, 49, 55]

### Strategy:
1. **Assign high-value items**: Start by assigning high-value items to each agent to ensure satisfaction.
2. **Balance remaining allocations**: Distribute remaining items to balance overall satisfaction.

### Allocation Process:
1. **High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (comparatively high value for Agent 2 and likely to reduce envy).

2. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (remaining item with a decent value for Agent 2).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations and minimize envy by considering the highest possible value items each can get.
