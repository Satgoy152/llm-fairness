Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  77  72  24  50  92
1  86  81  47  94  99  15
2  47  46   5   5  93  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 77 72 24 50 92]
 [86 81 47 94 99 15]
 [47 46  5  5 93 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. We will try to make sure each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   94   |   77   |   72   |   24   |   50   |   92   |
|   1   |   86   |   81   |   47   |   94   |   99   |   15   |
|   2   |   47   |   46   |    5   |    5   |   93   |   89   |

Here is one possible allocation considering fairness and envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (94), 5 (92)
   - Allocate items: 0, 5

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (99), 3 (94)
   - Allocate items: 3, 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Allocate remaining items: 1, 2
   - Values for these items: 1 (46), 2 (5)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some of their highly valued items, reducing envy among them. Below is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
