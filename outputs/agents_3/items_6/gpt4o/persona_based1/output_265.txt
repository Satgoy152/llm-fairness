Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  62  79  84  58   3
1  42  67  41  41  29  59
2  27  26  26  94  38  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 62 79 84 58  3]
 [42 67 41 41 29 59]
 [27 26 26 94 38 37]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents that respects their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations provided, we aim to distribute the items such that this condition is met as closely as possible.

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 82     | 62     | 79     | 84     | 58     | 3      |
| 1     | 42     | 67     | 41     | 41     | 29     | 59     |
| 2     | 27     | 26     | 26     | 94     | 38     | 37     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most across all agents, with a value of 94. Therefore, allocate item 3 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 1, and 2. Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has a reasonable valuation for item 5 (59), which is the highest among agent 1's valuations. Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** still has the highest valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values item 1 quite a bit (67), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** can take item 4, as it's one of the remaining items and agent 2 values it more than any other remaining items.

### Allocations:

Now we have allocated all items, ensuring that each agent gets some items based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```
