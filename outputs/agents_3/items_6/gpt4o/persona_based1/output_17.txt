Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  60  57   3  13  75
1  30  88  14  48   0  26
2  78  67  22  38  22  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to satisfy a condition known as "envy-freeness". This means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We'll use a method that tries to maximize each agent's valuation of their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**:  
   - Agent 0 has high valuations on items 0, 1, 2, and 5.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by allocating items with the highest valuations for each agent.
   - Ensure each agent receives at least some items they value highly to minimize envy.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since they value it the most.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it is one of their highest valued items.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - For item 2, Agent 0 values it the most, so assign it to them.
   - For item 3, Agent 1 values it the most, so assign it to them.
   - For item 4, neither agent values it highly, but Agent 2 could use another item, so assign it to Agent 2.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 5.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4.

This allocation minimizes envy and distributes the items fairly based on the given valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
