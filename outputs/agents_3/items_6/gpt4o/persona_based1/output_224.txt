Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  31  89  91  60  69
1  45  94  20  84  73  44
2  50  32  41  39  63  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible.

Let's examine this particular case. We have 3 agents and 6 items, meaning that each agent should receive 2 items if we want an equal number of items per agent.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [53, 31, 89, 91, 60, 69]
   - Highest values: Items 3 and 2 (values 91 and 89)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [45, 94, 20, 84, 73, 44]
   - Highest values: Items 1 and 4 (values 94 and 73)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [50, 32, 41, 39, 63, 25]
   - Highest values: Items 4 and 0 (values 63 and 50), but Item 4 is already taken. Next highest available is Item 0.

Using these observations, we can propose the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 5

This allocation gives each agent their highest possible valued items without conflicts, minimizing envy.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
