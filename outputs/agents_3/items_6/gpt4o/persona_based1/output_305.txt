Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  76  48  31  43  20
1  36   9  59   4  43  49
2  79  63  50  62  90  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I'll use an approach that aims to minimize envy and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common method for achieving a fair division is the "envy-free" criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we need to carefully assign the items to the agents to achieve this as closely as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [59, 76, 48, 31, 43, 20]
   - Highest value: Item 1 (76)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Values: [36, 9, 59, 4, 43, 49]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (59)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Values: [79, 63, 50, 62, 90, 85]
   - Highest value: Item 4 (90)

Allocate the highest valued items first to the respective agents:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

Now, allocate the remaining items based on the next highest remaining values:

- Remaining for Agent 0: [59, 48, 31, 43, 20]
- Remaining for Agent 1: [36, 9, 4, 43, 49]
- Remaining for Agent 2: [79, 63, 50, 62, 85]

After assigning the highest valued items:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (value 79 for Agent 2, highest among remaining)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (value 85 for Agent 2, second highest)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 31 for Agent 0, highest among remaining for Agent 0)

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to reduce envy by giving each agent some of their highest valued items.
