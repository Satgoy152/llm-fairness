Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  59  59  45  15   8
1  14  18  36  15   9  14
2  49  55  50  87  44  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [14 18 36 15  9 14]
 [49 55 50 87 44 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their perceived value and minimizes envy. The goal is to achieve an allocation where, as much as possible, no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's examine the value each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0: [56, 59, 59, 45, 15, 8]
- Agent 1: [14, 18, 36, 15, 9, 14]
- Agent 2: [49, 55, 50, 87, 44, 29]

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (87) and should receive it to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 0** places high value on items 1 and 2 (both 59). Assign them these items to keep them satisfied.
3. **Agent 2** also values items 0 (49), 1 (55), and 2 (50), but since items 1 and 2 are allocated to Agent 0, we will give item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 1** has their highest value on item 2 (36), but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we'll prioritize the next highest valued items for Agent 1. Assign item 5 (14) and 4 (9) to Agent 1, as they provide reasonable value to them without taking from the higher preference of others.

The allocations will be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3]

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of items such that each agent receives items of relatively high value to them without causing significant envy.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
