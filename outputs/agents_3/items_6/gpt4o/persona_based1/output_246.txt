Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  16  70  41  88  44
1  98  77  61  90  44   3
2   1   2  62  30   2  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 77 61 90 44  3]
 [ 1  2 62 30  2 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the Envy-Free Matching algorithm. This approach seeks to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 78     | 16     | 70     | 41     | 88     | 44     |
| 1     | 98     | 77     | 61     | 90     | 44     | 3      |
| 2     | 1      | 2      | 62     | 30     | 2      | 26     |

### Steps to allocate items:
1. **Prioritize the highest valued items for each agent**: Start by assigning the items that have the highest individual value for each agent.
2. **Resolve conflicts**: If more than one agent values an item the most, consider their subsequent preferred items and attempt to balance the allocations.
3. **Ensure envy-freeness**: Verify that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own, given their valuations.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Values Item 4 the most (88), so assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
  - Next, assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 70).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Values Item 0 the most (98), so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
  - Next, assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 90).

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 5 is reasonably valued by Agent 2 (26), assign Item 5 to Agent 2.
  - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 as it is the least valued by other agents.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [4, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 1]

Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent is accounted for in the allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 1]
}
```
