Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  95  97  38   3  94
1  96  73  98  49  57  26
2  35  12  70  70   2  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that each agent perceives as fair. Given the valuations, our goal is to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation, as much as possible, based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Agent 0: 89 + 95 + 97 + 38 + 3 + 94 = 416
   - Agent 1: 96 + 73 + 98 + 49 + 57 + 26 = 399
   - Agent 2: 35 + 12 + 70 + 70 + 2 + 86 = 275

2. **Determine allocation strategy**:
   - Aim to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their total valuations.

3. **Allocate the items**:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2, 0, and 4.
   - Agent 2 highly values items 5, 3, and 2.

4. **Assign the items with consideration for envy-freeness**:
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences while ensuring no item is doubly assigned.

Considering the above, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [1, 2]. Agent 0 has high values for these items.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [0, 4]. Agent 1 values these items significantly.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [3, 5]. These items are valuable to Agent 2.

This allocation aims to maximize the perceived value for each agent based on their respective valuations and equalize the envy as much as possible across the agents.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
