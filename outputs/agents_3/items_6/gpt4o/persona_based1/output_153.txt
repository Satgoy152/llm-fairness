Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   5  53  25  27  95
1  57   7  84  69   9  58
2  51  44  54  50  44  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59  5 53 25 27 95]
 [57  7 84 69  9 58]
 [51 44 54 50 44 32]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while maintaining integer allocations and minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. We will also ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and that the total of 6 items is allocated.

Here is a possible allocation using the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (95) and Item 0 (59).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (84) and Item 3 (69).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (44) and Item 4 (44).

With these allocations, each agent receives two items, and these items are chosen based on the highest valuations for each agent to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the total of six items is allocated among the agents while considering their valuation preferences.
