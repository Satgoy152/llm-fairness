Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  55   2  41  50  57
1  88  80  36  84  86  78
2  34   5  67  48   7   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to satisfy fairness criteria like envy-freeness as best as possible. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here's one possible approach to allocating the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuations:** Start by identifying the items with the highest valuations for each agent to ensure that each gets items they highly value.

2. **Allocate items to eliminate or minimize envy:** Distribute the items such that no agent envies another agentâ€™s allocation more than their own.

3. **Check for envy-freeness:** Verify if the allocation minimizes envy or achieves envy-freeness. This involves checking that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Has high valuations for items 5 (57) and 1 (55). Allocate these items.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Has high valuations for items 0 (88) and 4 (86). Allocate these items.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Has the highest valuation for item 2 (67) and a reasonable valuation for item 3 (48). Allocate these items.

This allocation is designed to provide each agent with items they highly value while minimizing the potential for envy among the agents.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items and that the total of 6 items is allocated without any being left unassigned.
