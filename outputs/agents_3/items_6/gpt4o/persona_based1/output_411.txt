Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  79  17  91  77   5
1  45  41  36   7  51  26
2  98  88  77  97  62  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 41 36  7 51 26]
 [98 88 77 97 62 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where no agent envies another based on their valuations of the items. We have to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [6, 79, 17, 91, 77, 5]
- Agent 1: [45, 41, 36, 7, 51, 26]
- Agent 2: [98, 88, 77, 97, 62, 31]

A potential envy-free allocation approach involves initially assigning the items to the agents based on maximizing individual preferences while striving for balance. We'll attempt to allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total valuation or satisfaction.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 0, item 1, and item 3. Let's assign these items to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly, but since it's already assigned, we'll focus on assigning items 4 and 5 which are among the next highest for agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** can then be assigned the remaining items.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 2**: [0, 1, 3] (Values: 98, 88, 97)
- **Agent 0**: [4, 5] (Values: 77, 5)
- **Agent 1**: [2] (Values: 36)

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives, while giving priority to the highest valued items for each agent and ensuring no items are left unallocated.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a set of items that attempts to balance the total values based on their individual preferences, while ensuring every item is allocated.
