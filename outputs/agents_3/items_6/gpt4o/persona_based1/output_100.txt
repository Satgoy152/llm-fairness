Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  65  42  33  48  98
1  25  48  71  76  81   9
2  72  36  30  71  88  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 36 30 71 88 27]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. This means trying to distribute items in a way that each agent feels they received an equal or fair share based on their valuation, and no agent envies another's allocation.

We can start by examining the valuations and attempting to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 98), so we allocate item 5 to agent 0. Agent 0 also values item 1 (value 65) highly, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
  
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (value 81), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1. Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 3 (value 76), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 88), but since item 4 is already allocated, we allocate the next highest available item, which is item 0 (value 72), to agent 2. Agent 2 also values item 3 (value 71), but since item 3 is already allocated, we allocate item 2 (value 30) to agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
Based on the above considerations, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 2.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the agents' preferences with a reasonable attempt at fairness given their valuations.
