Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  97  19  69  31  92
1  95  12  57  22  60  62
2  45   5  90  29  22  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives items in a manner that minimizes envy, considering all agents have integer allocations and all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (97) and item 5 as second-highest (92).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (95) and item 4 as second-highest (60).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (90) and item 5 (66) as the second-highest.

A potential allocation strategy is to give each agent their highest or one of their high-value items, ensuring each gets a significant share of their perceived value. We will attempt to allocate in a manner that minimizes envy:

1. **Assign the highest valued items:**
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (95) since it's their highest valued item.
   - Agent 0 gets item 1 (97) since it's their highest valued item.
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (90) since it's their highest valued item.

2. **Assign remaining items to balance perceived values:**
   - Agent 0 can also get item 5 (92) to complement their high valuation of item 1.
   - Agent 1 can also get items 3 (22) and 4 (60) to add up their valuation.

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 gets items with values totaling 189.
- Agent 1 gets items with values totaling 177.
- Agent 2 gets items with values totaling 90.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value across agents while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2]
}
```
