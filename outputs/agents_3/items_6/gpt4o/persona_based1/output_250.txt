Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  29  78  75   1  75
1  95  23  19  64  65  29
2   9  35  45  27  90  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution or as close to it as possible. The goal is to ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations. A common approach is to maximize the minimum utility across all agents, making sure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 75
  - Item 4: 1
  - Item 5: 75

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 64
  - Item 4: 65
  - Item 5: 29

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 27
  - Item 4: 90
  - Item 5: 84

We will use a simple allocation strategy where each agent is allocated items that maximize their own valuations while ensuring that each item is allocated only once and all items are distributed.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (95), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (90), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (78), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also values item 3 and 5 equally (75), but since item 3 is not yet allocated, we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 (84), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
6. Finally, item 1 is left, and **Agent 2** values it next highest (35), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 5

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
