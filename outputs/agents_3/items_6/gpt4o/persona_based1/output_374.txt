Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  60  40  50  36  37
1  36  37  75  97   6  52
2  80  40  86  96  49  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will use a method that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives. This approach is often more art than science, especially with small numbers and discrete items, but we'll try our best to achieve a fair distribution.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [87, 60, 40, 50, 36, 37]
- Agent 1: [36, 37, 75, 97, 6, 52]
- Agent 2: [80, 40, 86, 96, 49, 36]

First, let's rank the items based on each agent's valuation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 > Item 1 > Item 3 > Item 2 > Item 5 > Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 3 > Item 2 > Item 5 > Item 1 > Item 0 > Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3 > Item 2 > Item 0 > Item 4 > Item 1 > Item 5

Let's start by allocating the items that are most valued by each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one high-value item if possible.

1. **Allocating Item 3**: It is highly valued by all agents, but Agent 1 values it the most (97). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Allocating Item 0**: It's highly valued by Agent 0 (87) and Agent 2 (80). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 as they value it the most.
3. **Allocating Item 2**: It is highly valued by Agent 1 (75) and Agent 2 (86). Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 as they value it the most.
4. **Allocating Item 5**: It is moderately valued by Agent 1 (52) and less by others. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
5. **Allocating Item 1**: It is moderately valued by Agent 0 (60) and less by others. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
6. **Allocating Item 4**: Lastly, it is moderately valued by Agent 2 (49) and the least by others. Assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, each agent has some items, and we have allocated all 6 items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```
