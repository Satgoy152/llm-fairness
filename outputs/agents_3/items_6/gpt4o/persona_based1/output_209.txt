Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  14  21  82  79  21
1  13  90  15  84  90  78
2  12  98  79  27  82  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: [43, 14, 21, 82, 79, 21]
- **Agent 1**: [13, 90, 15, 84, 90, 78]
- **Agent 2**: [12, 98, 79, 27, 82, 50]

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 98.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 90.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 also values this item the highest at 78.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 82.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 43.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 79.

### Allocations:

- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 2**.
- Assign **Item 4** to **Agent 1**.
- Assign **Item 5** to **Agent 1**.
- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 0**.
- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 0**.
- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 2**.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This distribution respects the preferences of the agents based on their valuations, aiming to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation.
