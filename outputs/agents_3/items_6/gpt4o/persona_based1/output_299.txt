Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  94  93   3  30  81
1  33  84  61  27  11  80
2  72  74  46  97  61  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their individual valuation, while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible. Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (valuation: 94).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (valuation: 84), but it is already considered for Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (valuation: 97).

2. **Assign items based on highest valuations without overlap:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

3. **Consider the next highest valuations for remaining items:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valuation is for item 2 (valuation: 93).
   - Agent 1's next highest available valuation is for item 5 (valuation: 80).
   - Agent 2's next highest available valuation is for item 0 (valuation: 72).

4. **Complete the allocation ensuring that all items are distributed:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1, since it is the next highest available item for Agent 1.

By following this process, we ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while attempting to maintain a fair division. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and attempts to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.
