Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  90  43  15  70  82
1  21  61  38  88  66   6
2  69  86  88  51  17  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given that there are 6 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get 2 items. Here is one way to do this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items 1 and 4: Total value = 90 + 70 = 160

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items 3 and 0: Total value = 88 + 21 = 109

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items 2 and 5: Total value = 88 + 40 = 128

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the distribution attempts to balance the total values across agents as much as possible while respecting the individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 5]
}
```
