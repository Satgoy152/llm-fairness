Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  85  15  50  31  16
1  26  17  53  44  11  85
2  87  45  70   0  44   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, given their valuations.

Let's break down the approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Look at the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate these items to reduce potential envy.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the least but has relatively high valuations on items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 places a high value on item 5.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 0.

3. **Balance and Adjust Allocations:**
   - We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Considering this, an initial allocation can be:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1 and 3 (85 + 50 = 135)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2 and 5 (53 + 85 = 138)
- **Agent 2:** Items 0 and 4 (87 + 44 = 131)

This allocation ensures that each agent's total value is relatively balanced, reducing potential envy. 

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
