Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50   1  43  25  75  61
1  26   1  83  48  65  43
2  84  14  60  98  73  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50  1 43 25 75 61]
 [26  1 83 48 65 43]
 [84 14 60 98 73 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

### Valuations Matrix:
```
        0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0: 50   1  43  25  75  61
Agent 1: 26   1  83  48  65  43
Agent 2: 84  14  60  98  73  88
```

### Steps to Allocate Fairly:
1. **Identify High-Value Items**: We should consider items that have high valuations for specific agents and try to allocate these items to those agents.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets Items**: Allocate items to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
3. **Avoid Envy**: Try to match allocations with agents' high-value items to minimize envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for Item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Has a particularly high valuation for Item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Prefers Item 3 the most, but also has high valuations for Items 0 and 5.

### Allocation Plan:
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Items 0, 3, and 5 to Agent 2.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 to ensure all items are distributed.

### Final Allocation:
Based on the above strategy, the allocation in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences, while all items are distributed among the agents.
