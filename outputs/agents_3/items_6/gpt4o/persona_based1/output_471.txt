Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  87  32  89   4  32
1  60  26  84  73  70  78
2  64  52  88  85  42  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[18 87 32 89  4 32]
 [60 26 84 73 70 78]
 [64 52 88 85 42 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that considers the agents' valuations and aims for envy-freeness as much as possible, given the integer constraint.

Here's the valuation matrix presented in tabular form for clarity:

| Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 18 | 87 | 32 | 89 | 4  | 32 |
| 1          | 60 | 26 | 84 | 73 | 70 | 78 |
| 2          | 64 | 52 | 88 | 85 | 42 | 91 |

We will use the following procedure:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to maximize the total perceived value for each agent's allocation.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 18 + 87 + 32 + 89 + 4 + 32 = 262
- Total value for Agent 1: 60 + 26 + 84 + 73 + 70 + 78 = 391
- Total value for Agent 2: 64 + 52 + 88 + 85 + 42 + 91 = 422

Start by prioritizing allocations based on the highest individual valuations:

1. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (91), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (87), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (84), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 3 (89), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 2 values item 0 (64), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 1 values item 4 (70), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to balance the allocations based on each agent's perceived value of their assigned items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning high-value items to agents that value them the most, within the constraints of fair division and envy-freeness.
