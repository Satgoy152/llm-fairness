Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  13  81  14  97  38
1  38   3   4  19  64   6
2  73  45  21  73  87  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 45 21 73 87 46]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item and aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the "maximum envy-free" approach, which focuses on minimizing envy and ensuring each agent receives items they value relatively highly compared to the other agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (97) and item 2 (81) next.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (38) and item 4 (64) next.
- Agent 2 values items 0 (73) and 4 (87) highly.

Given these valuations, let's try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming to minimize envy:

1. Item 4 is highly valued by all agents but is most valued by Agent 0. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
3. Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Item 5 is moderately valued by Agent 2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
5. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 2 among the remaining items. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
6. Item 3, though not highly valued by any agent, can be allocated to Agent 1 since they have received no items yet.

So the allocation plan is:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 1, and 5.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5]
}
```
