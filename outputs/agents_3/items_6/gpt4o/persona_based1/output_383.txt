Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  57  98  14  35  50
1  45  34  39  48   7  18
2  21  70   5   2  90  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 57 98 14 35 50]
 [45 34 39 48  7 18]
 [21 70  5  2 90 11]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy. This approach involves allocating items to agents in a way that each agent values their bundle as much as possible relative to the other agents' bundles.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  57  98  14  35  50
1  45  34  39  48   7  18
2  21  70   5   2  90  11
```

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, we allocate item 2 to Agent 0. This addresses their high valuation and potential envy.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so we allocate item 3 to them.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to them.

Now, we allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 5) based on maximizing each agent's valuation and ensuring fairness:

4. **For item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 45.
   - Agent 2 values it at 21.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 since they have the highest valuation.

5. **For item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Agent 2 values it at 70.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation.

6. **For item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 50.
   - Agent 1 values it at 18.
   - Agent 2 values it at 11.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, who has the highest valuation.

Following this strategy, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering individual item preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
