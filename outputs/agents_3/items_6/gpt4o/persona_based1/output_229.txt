Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  17  18  41  41  37
1  42  48  32  12  31  86
2  40  60  37  28  20  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 48 32 12 31 86]
 [40 60 37 28 20 99]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should consider maximizing fairness criteria such as envy-freeness and equitable distribution based on the agents' valuations. Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  17  18  41  41  37
1  42  48  32  12  31  86
2  40  60  37  28  20  99
```

We aim to allocate 6 items in total among the 3 agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no agent envies another based on their valuations.

One approach is to use the "greedy" algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items based on this criterion:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 42 (highest), so item 0 goes to agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 60 (highest), so item 1 goes to agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 37 (highest), so item 2 goes to agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 41 (highest), so item 3 goes to agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 41 (highest), so item 4 goes to agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 99 (highest), so item 5 goes to agent 2.

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 2, and 5.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated based on each agent's highest valuations, and each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.
