Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  49  73  90  74  22
1  29  39  35  32   8  38
2  78  28  45  83  33  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means ensuring that each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Consider Each Agent's Total Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: 49, 49, 73, 90, 74, 22 = Total valuation of 357.
   - Agent 1: 29, 39, 35, 32, 8, 38 = Total valuation of 181.
   - Agent 2: 78, 28, 45, 83, 33, 93 = Total valuation of 360.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Allocate items based on which agent values an item the most, while ensuring each agent gets some items.

3. **Adjust to Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item:**
   - Start with the agent who has the highest total valuation (Agent 2) and allocate their most valued items first.
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item to avoid envy.

4. **Evaluate and Adjust for Envy-Freeness:**
   - Adjust allocations to minimize envy and balance total valuations.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0:
  - Item 3 (value 90)
  - Item 4 (value 74)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 1 (value 39)
  - Item 5 (value 38)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 0 (value 78)
  - Item 2 (value 45)

This allocation ensures each agent gets 2 items, and we aim for each to have close valuations, considering their preferences.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and attempts to balance the perceived value based on the original valuations.
