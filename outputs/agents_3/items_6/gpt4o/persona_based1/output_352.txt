Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  89  95  81  22  72
1  57  11  41  12  75  53
2  25  39  96  76  13  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 89 95 81 22 72]
 [57 11 41 12 75 53]
 [25 39 96 76 13 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation from their perspective. Given the valuations matrix, we'll use a heuristic approach to achieve a relatively fair distribution.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [80, 89, 95, 81, 22, 72]
- Agent 1: [57, 11, 41, 12, 75, 53]
- Agent 2: [25, 39, 96, 76, 13, 11]

An efficient way to approach this problem is to allocate items by considering the maximum value each agent assigns to available items, iterating through the process while ensuring no agent is left significantly worse off.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2 (95) and 1 (89). We will allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (96), but it's already allocated. The next highest valued item is item 3 (76), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (75). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. Now, we consider remaining items: 0, 5. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (80), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 5 (53) more than Agent 2 (11), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, we have the following allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [3]

This allocation is done keeping in mind each agent's highest valuation for remaining items at each step. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3]
}
```
