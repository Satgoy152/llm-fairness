Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  68  58  71  24  12
1  35  61  84  66  70  65
2  42  32  90  24  28  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy among agents. This often involves trying to equalize the perceived value each agent receives, based on their own valuations.

Here is one possible allocation strategy based on the provided valuations:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: 4 + 68 + 58 + 71 + 24 + 12 = 237
   - Agent 1: 35 + 61 + 84 + 66 + 70 + 65 = 381
   - Agent 2: 42 + 32 + 90 + 24 + 28 + 66 = 282

2. **Allocate Items to Agents:**
   - Start by assigning the item with the highest value for each agent to that agent, then proceed to allocate remaining items in a way that balances the total value as closely as possible across agents.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [3, 1] with values [71, 68]. Total value = 139
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 4] with values [84, 70]. Total value = 154
   - Agent 2: Items [5, 0] with values [66, 42]. Total value = 108

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives based on their own valuations.

4. **JSON Representation of the Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. The distribution tries to balance the perceived value for each agent, minimizing envy.
