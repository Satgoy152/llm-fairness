Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  14  23  41  31  51
1  96  43  48  16  91  90
2  94  96  86   5   5  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 43 48 16 91 90]
 [94 96 86  5  5 65]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. An ideal allocation should aim to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent feels they received a fair share compared to others. Given the valuations and the constraint that each agent must receive at least one item and the total number of items is fixed at six, we will proceed with an allocation strategy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [97, 14, 23, 41, 31, 51]
- Agent 1 values: [96, 43, 48, 16, 91, 90]
- Agent 2 values: [94, 96, 86, 5, 5, 65]

One strategy is to assign each agent the items they value the most while ensuring all items are distributed. We will consider the highest values each agent has and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued items are 0 (97) and 5 (51).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued items are 1 (43) and 4 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued items are 2 (86) and 3 (5).

Now, let's make the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items: [4, 1]
- Agent 2 gets items: [2, 3]

Each agent receives two items, and all items are allocated. This allocation takes into account the highest individual valuations while distributing the items fairly.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items with high personal value, aiming to reduce envy and achieve a fair division of the items.
