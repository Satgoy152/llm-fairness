Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  47  67  68  76  65
1  99  64  71   2  64  44
2  34  62  60  96  26  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 47 67 68 76 65]
 [99 64 71  2 64 44]
 [34 62 60 96 26 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share. We will try to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here's the table of valuations for reference:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5
Agent 0:  79  47  67  68  76  65
Agent 1:  99  64  71   2  64  44
Agent 2:  34  62  60  96  26  36
```

To approach this problem, we can use a method that considers maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll try to assign the items to the agents such that the total value each agent gets is as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 0 the most, followed by item 4. We assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 the most, followed by item 2. We assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 3 the most, followed by item 5. We assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a manner that respects the preferences of the agents based on their valuations and balances the total value received by each agent.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and we consider the valuation preferences of the agents.
