Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  48  66   6  66  25
1  50  98  47  54  49  76
2  26  13  87  97   5  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for the envy-freeness criterion, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. Here, we are dealing with 3 agents and 6 items, which means each agent should ideally receive 2 items if the distribution is to be balanced by the number of items. However, the primary focus is to ensure no agent envies another based on their valuation.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [3, 48, 66, 6, 66, 25]
- Agent 1: [50, 98, 47, 54, 49, 76]
- Agent 2: [26, 13, 87, 97, 5, 35]

We aim for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while minimizing envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (98) and item 5 (76).
   - Allocate items [1, 5] to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation remaining for item 3 (97) and item 2 (87).
   - Allocate items [2, 3] to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining items are 0 and 4.
   - Allocate items [0, 4] to Agent 0, as these are the only items left.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items such that their overall utility is maximized based on their own valuations, and ideally, the envy among agents is minimized given the constraint of integer allocations.
