Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  69  74  81  21  90
1  80  85  44  10  97  72
2  98  35  35  14  29  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 69 74 81 21 90]
 [80 85 44 10 97 72]
 [98 35 35 14 29 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that balances the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would have for each possible allocation, then determine an allocation that minimizes envy. Here's the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [22, 69, 74, 81, 21, 90]
Agent 1: [80, 85, 44, 10, 97, 72]
Agent 2: [98, 35, 35, 14, 29, 61]
```

A fair approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value = 90)
- Assign items 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 1 (values = 80, 10, 97)
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 2 (values = 35, 35)

The allocation results in the following total values:

- Agent 0: 90
- Agent 1: 187
- Agent 2: 70

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable and somewhat balanced total value based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
