Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  39  16  48  19  70
1  70  13  87  34  41  62
2   3   8  68  79  37   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have 6 items to allocate among 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items to ensure all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (70)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (55)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (87)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (70) (already chosen by Agent 0)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (79)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 2 (68) (already chosen by Agent 1)

Based on this, we can allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 5 and 0 (Agent 0's highest and second-highest valued items)
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items 2 and 4 (Agent 1's highest valued item and next highest available item)
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items 3 and 1 (Agent 2's highest valued item and next highest available item)

This allocation ensures each agent receives 2 items and maximizes their preferences while avoiding envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```
