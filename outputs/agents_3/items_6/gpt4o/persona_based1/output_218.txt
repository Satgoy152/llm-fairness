Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  49  48   3  84  67
1   8  19  43  40  43  80
2  76  65   5  49  62  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their own bundle as at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most, followed by item 5. Therefore, we'll start by assigning items 4 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most, but since it's already taken, we will assign Agent 1 items 3 and 2, which have the next highest valuations for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most, followed by item 1. Since these items are not yet allocated, we assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, aiming to reduce envy as much as possible given the constraints. Here's the final allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
