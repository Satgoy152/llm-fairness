Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  96  93  14  34  82
1  55  81  38  39  44   2
2  76  59  16  35  90   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we will aim to achieve a division that respects envy-freeness as much as possible, given that each agent must receive a whole number of items and all items must be allocated.

We have three agents and six items to allocate, with the following valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [7, 96, 93, 14, 34, 82]
- Agent 1 values: [55, 81, 38, 39, 44, 2]
- Agent 2 values: [76, 59, 16, 35, 90, 0]

One generally accepted approach in fair division is to use an allocation method that attempts to minimize envy. One such method is the "round-robin" method, which allows each agent to take turns choosing their most preferred available item.

Below is one possible allocation using a round-robin approach:

1. Round 1:
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 96).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 55).
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 90).

2. Round 2:
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 93).
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 39).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 0).

This allocation gives each agent 2 items and aims to minimize envy by allowing agents to choose their most valued remaining items in turn.

Let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
