Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73   4  57  20  97  92
1  69  66  77  61   4  67
2  54  31  89   4  95  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as best as possible, considering the valuations each agent has for the items. Given the constraints, we attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences, ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (73), 4 (97), 5 (92) highly.
- Agent 1 values items: 2 (77), 1 (66), 5 (67) highly.
- Agent 2 values items: 2 (89), 4 (95), 5 (45) highly.

A possible allocation strategy is to start by assigning each agent their most valued item and then distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived value each agent receives. 

Let's allocate:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it's their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it's a high-valued item for them.

Now, distribute the remaining items (0, 1, 3):

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 0
- Agent 1: Items 5, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent gets exactly two items, leading to a fair distribution given the constraints. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
