Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  48  55  97  31  28
1  56  79  31  37  24  89
2  69  70  14  93  55  24
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. We can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [36, 48, 55, 97, 31, 28]
- Agent 1: [56, 79, 31, 37, 24, 89]
- Agent 2: [69, 70, 14, 93, 55, 24]

We'll allocate the items to maximize each agent's total value while trying to maintain envy-freeness.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value: 97)
   - Second highest valued item: 2 (value: 55)
   - Allocate items 3 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value: 79)
   - Second highest valued item: 5 (value: 89)
   - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: 0 (value: 69)
   - Second highest valued item: 4 (value: 55)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their utility, considering their valuations. Let's verify:

- **Agent 0**: Total value = 97 + 55 = 152
- **Agent 1**: Total value = 79 + 89 = 168
- **Agent 2**: Total value = 69 + 55 = 124

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their most preferred items, maximizing their satisfaction given their respective valuations.
