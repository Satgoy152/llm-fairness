Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50   0  22  58  18  75
1  99  13  74  20  44  95
2  70  27  87  59  13  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities of all agents. This approach often leads to allocations that are fair and envy-free or close to it.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 50 + 0 + 22 + 58 + 18 + 75 = 223
- Agent 1: 99 + 13 + 74 + 20 + 44 + 95 = 345
- Agent 2: 70 + 27 + 87 + 59 + 13 + 78 = 334

Given these total valuations, we need to allocate 6 items in such a way that each agent gets an integer number of items and the overall distribution is as fair as possible.

A plausible allocation strategy is to assign items based on maximizing the individual agent's utility for each item while trying to balance the number of items each agent receives:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2: 
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (87).

2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (99).

3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (58).

4. Assign item 5 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (95).

5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the next highest (18).

6. Assign item 2 to Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 highly (87).

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while maintaining an integer number of items for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
