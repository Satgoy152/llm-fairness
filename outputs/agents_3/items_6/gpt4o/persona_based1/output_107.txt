Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  22  94  75  16  91
1  33  88  79  49  77  65
2  24  67  17  57  71  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, according to their valuations. Given the valuations of each agent for each item, we will try to allocate the items in a way that approximates this criterion.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0: [11, 22, 94, 75, 16, 91]
- Agent 1: [33, 88, 79, 49, 77, 65]
- Agent 2: [24, 67, 17, 57, 71, 34]

To ensure each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is fair, we can follow these steps:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to each agent**: Begin by giving each agent their most valued item.
2. **Distribute remaining items**: Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations, ensuring no agent is left with an empty allocation.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Their highest valued item is item 2 (value 94).
- **Agent 1**: Their highest valued item is item 1 (value 88).
- **Agent 2**: Their highest valued item is item 4 (value 71).

After assigning these items, the remaining items are 0, 3, and 5.

- **Remaining Assignments**: 
  - For item 0, agent 1 values it the most (33), so assign it to agent 1.
  - For item 3, agent 0 values it the most (75), so assign it to agent 0.
  - For item 5, agent 0 values it the most (91), so assign it to agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed fairly based on the given valuations.
