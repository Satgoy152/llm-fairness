Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  82  22  58  81  92
1  17  49  69  91   6  98
2  94  13  31  86  33  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 49 69 91  6 98]
 [94 13 31 86 33 38]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes the value as evenly as possible. Here is one way to achieve this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 5 (value 92) and item 0 (value 72).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 (value 91) and item 5 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 (value 94) and item 3 (value 86).

Considering these preferences and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item while minimizing envy, one possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (value 82), 2 (value 22)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 (value 91), 5 (value 98)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 (value 94), 4 (value 33)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution of values among agents is relatively balanced.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
