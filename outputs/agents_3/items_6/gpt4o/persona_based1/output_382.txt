Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  37  13  64  37  53  75
1  70  71  67  53  49  79
2  72   9  98  28  49  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 71 67 53 49 79]
 [72  9 98 28 49 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll employ a method that balances the valuations and tries to maximize each agent's total valuation from their allocated items. A common approach is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [37, 13, 64, 37, 53, 75]
Agent 1: [70, 71, 67, 53, 49, 79]
Agent 2: [72, 9, 98, 28, 49, 60]
```

Let's start by considering which items are most valuable to each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 75.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 79.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 98.

To minimize envy, let's try to allocate the highest valued items to each agent first:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value for them (98).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for them (79).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 because it's their next highest value (72), which is greater than Agent 0's valuation of the item (37).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it's among the higher values for them and less desirable for others.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation (71) for them.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, balancing their allocation with their remaining highest preference.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each gets two items.
