Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  12  22  18  79  93
1  79  96  95  28  43  62
2  98  91  77  39   9  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 91 77 39  9 79]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to allocate items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

One common approach to achieve this is to use an algorithm known as the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) allocation, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities (values) that each agent receives. This often leads to an allocation that is both efficient and fairly balanced in terms of envy.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [7, 12, 22, 18, 79, 93]
- Agent 1: [79, 96, 95, 28, 43, 62]
- Agent 2: [98, 91, 77, 39, 9, 79]

We need to allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents.

A possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 5
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives items with high valuations according to their preferences, trying to balance the total value received by each.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
