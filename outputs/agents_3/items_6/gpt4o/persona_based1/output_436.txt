Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  58  54  39  79   8
1  49  14   2   3  76  52
2  57  82  79  17  65  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, we will consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the agents' satisfaction with their allocations while ensuring that each agent receives at least some value from their allocated items.

Given the following valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 2  | 58 | 54 | 39 | 79 | 8  |
| 1          | 49 | 14 | 2  | 3  | 76 | 52 |
| 2          | 57 | 82 | 79 | 17 | 65 | 57 |

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most (79), followed by Agent 1 (76). Agent 2 values it at 65. We allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most (82), followed by Agent 0 (58) and Agent 1 (14). We allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most (79), followed by Agent 0 (54) and Agent 1 (2). We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most (57), followed by Agent 1 (49) and Agent 0 (2). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most (52), followed by Agent 2 (57) and Agent 0 (8). We allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the most (39), followed by Agent 2 (17) and Agent 1 (3). We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```
