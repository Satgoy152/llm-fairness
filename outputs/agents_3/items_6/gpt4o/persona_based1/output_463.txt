Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  69  62  57  99  76
1  80  51  93  18  60   6
2  12  88  82  52   3  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 69 62 57 99 76]
 [80 51 93 18 60  6]
 [12 88 82 52  3 78]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the distribution is envy-free as much as possible. An optimal approach might involve considering each agent's preferences and maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Given the valuation matrix, we need to allocate the 6 items to the 3 agents. We should aim to make each agent as satisfied as possible, potentially considering envy-freeness and efficiency.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  69  62  57  99  76
1  80  51  93  18  60   6
2  12  88  82  52   3  78
```

To allocate the items fairly:
1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (99).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (93).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (88).

Let's allocate these items first to each agent based on their highest valuation:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated items 4, 2, and 1. Remaining items are 0, 3, and 5. Let's allocate these based on the next highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 has high values for item 0 (90) and item 5 (76).
- Agent 1 has remaining high value for item 0 (80).
- Agent 2 has remaining high value for item 5 (78).

Let's prioritize maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (90).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (18) as Agent 1 has no other higher preference left.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (78).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations, while ensuring that all 6 items are distributed without leaving any agent with an empty allocation.
