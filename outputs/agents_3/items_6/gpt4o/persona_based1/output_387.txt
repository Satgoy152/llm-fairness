Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4   6   7  84  60  19
1  43  66  67  29  75  11
2   4  21  16  70  91   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 66 67 29 75 11]
 [ 4 21 16 70 91  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and taking into account their valuations, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 4, 6, 7, 84, 60, 19
- Agent 1 values: 43, 66, 67, 29, 75, 11
- Agent 2 values: 4, 21, 16, 70, 91, 9

Given these valuations, we should try to allocate items so that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly while minimizing envy for items allocated to others.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 the most (84) and item 4 next (60).
   - Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (67) and item 1 (66).
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4 (91) and item 3 (70), but item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, so consider the next highest, item 0 (4).
   - Allocate items 0 and 5 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items and maintain fairness by distributing the items in a way that considers each agent's preferences.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
