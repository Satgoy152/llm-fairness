Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97   0  93  13  56   5
1  10   0  75  47   3  38
2  28  42  62  31  76  73
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97  0 93 13 56  5]
 [10  0 75 47  3 38]
 [28 42 62 31 76 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to find a distribution where each agent receives items based on their valuations such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should not prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [97, 0, 93, 13, 56, 5]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [10, 0, 75, 47, 3, 38]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [28, 42, 62, 31, 76, 73]

A possible allocation strategy involves giving each agent the items they value most, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated remains 6.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (97), 2 (93)
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (75), 3 (47), 5 (38)
   - Item 2 is already allocated. Next highest value: 3.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (76), 5 (73), 1 (42)
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 2

4. **Remaining Item**:
   - Item 1 has not been allocated yet.
   - Agent 2 values it the highest (42), but given that they already have 2 items, we consider other agents.
   - Since Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 1 (0 compared to Agent 1's 0), allocate item 1 to Agent 2 to balance the total number of items.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5, 1]

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, while trying to maintain an envy-free distribution.
