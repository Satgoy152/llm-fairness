Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  76  88   6   5  13
1  98   9  15  31  45  95
2  59  54  68  69  74  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. This means each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Let's analyze the valuations for each item by each agent and try to allocate the items accordingly.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0: 62
  - Agent 1: 98
  - Agent 2: 59

- **Item 1**:
  - Agent 0: 76
  - Agent 1: 9
  - Agent 2: 54

- **Item 2**:
  - Agent 0: 88
  - Agent 1: 15
  - Agent 2: 68

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0: 6
  - Agent 1: 31
  - Agent 2: 69

- **Item 4**:
  - Agent 0: 5
  - Agent 1: 45
  - Agent 2: 74

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0: 13
  - Agent 1: 95
  - Agent 2: 42

A possible envy-free allocation can be made by assigning the items as follows:

1. Assign **Item 0** to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 98).
2. Assign **Item 1** to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 76).
3. Assign **Item 2** to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 88).
4. Assign **Item 3** to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 69).
5. Assign **Item 4** to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 74).
6. Assign **Item 5** to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 95).

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items (2 items each), and all items are allocated.
