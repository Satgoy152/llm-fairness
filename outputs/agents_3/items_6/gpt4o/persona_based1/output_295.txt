Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  62  30  41   9  62
1  18  13   9  58  88  41
2  89  10  35  32  16  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One common method is the "round-robin" allocation, where each agent takes turns selecting their most valued item that is still available.

Here's a possible step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** selects their most valued item first:
   - Item 1 (value 62)

2. **Agent 1** selects next:
   - Item 4 (value 88)

3. **Agent 2** selects:
   - Item 0 (value 89)

4. **Agent 0** selects their next most valued item:
   - Item 5 (value 62)

5. **Agent 1** selects:
   - Item 3 (value 58)

6. **Agent 2** selects:
   - Item 2 (value 35)

Now, all items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

Each agent has received two items, and the allocation tries to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
