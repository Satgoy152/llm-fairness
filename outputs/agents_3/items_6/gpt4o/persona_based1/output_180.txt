Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  74  38  92  94  49
1  56  70  28   7  87  13
2  89  94  99   8  58   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 6 items among the 3 agents in a fair manner considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another based on their own valuations. 

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 38
  - Item 3: 92
  - Item 4: 94
  - Item 5: 49

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 7
  - Item 4: 87
  - Item 5: 13

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 8
  - Item 4: 58
  - Item 5: 6

The goal is to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items such that they feel they're getting at least as much value as any other agent's bundle.

A possible fair allocation could be:

1. Start by assigning items based on highest individual valuations to avoid envy:
   - Agent 2 highly values Item 2 (99), so assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 0 (97), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 4 (87) the highest, so assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

2. Assign the remaining items considering the second-highest valuations:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 2, as they value it at 94.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it at 92.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1, as neither Agent 0 nor Agent 2 has a strong preference for it.

This allocation leads to the following distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3], with a total valuation of 97 + 92 = 189
- Agent 1 receives items [4, 5], with a total valuation of 87 + 13 = 100
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 1], with a total valuation of 99 + 94 = 193

Each agent receives items that maximize their own valuations relative to others, minimizing envy under the constraints given.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 1]
}
```
