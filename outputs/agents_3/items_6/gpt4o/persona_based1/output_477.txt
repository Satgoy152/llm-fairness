Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  97  71   9  53  52
1  82  41  43  94  65  85
2  65  40  66  35  30  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we will use a method that tries to maximize each agent's utility based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One effective approach is to use an iterative method to allocate items one at a time based on the highest marginal increase in utility for each agent.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 9
  - Item 4: 53
  - Item 5: 52

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 4: 65
  - Item 5: 85

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 35
  - Item 4: 30
  - Item 5: 53

To allocate the items:

1. Assign items based on the highest value:
   - Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (97).
   - Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (94).
   - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 (66).

2. Continue allocating the remaining items based on the next highest marginal utility:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 82.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 85.

3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Adjust allocations if necessary to maintain fairness and envy-freeness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3, 0, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]

This allocation considers the highest valued items by each agent and attempts to balance the distribution fairly.

In JSON format, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 0, 5],
    "2": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
