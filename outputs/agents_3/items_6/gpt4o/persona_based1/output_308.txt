Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  19  95   2  99  93
1  78  88  35  20  68  21
2  17  87  74  91  47  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should receive a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own, based on their valuations.

Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: Look at the highest valuations each agent has for the items to identify potential allocations.
2. **Prioritize High-Valuation Items**: Assign items to agents who value them significantly higher than others, if possible.
3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items to minimize envy, ensuring each agent feels they have a fair share.

Based on the table:
- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (63), 2 (95), and 4 (99).
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 (88) and 4 (68).
- Agent 2 highly values items 3 (91).

Let's proceed to allocate:

1. **Allocate Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most (99), so assign it to them.
2. **Allocate Item 2**: Agent 0 also values item 2 highly (95), assign it to them.
3. **Allocate Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (91), so assign it to them.
4. **Allocate Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most (88), so assign it to them.
5. **Allocate Item 0**: Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 0 (78), so assign it to them.
6. **Allocate Item 5**: Agent 0 values item 5 highly (93), assign it to them.

With this allocation, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3]
}
```
