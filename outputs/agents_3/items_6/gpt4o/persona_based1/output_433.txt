Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26   3  30  49  63   6
1  98  27  10  49  22  40
2  41  19  95   6  22  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the envy-free item allocation or the adjusted winner procedure. However, given the discrete nature of this problem (integer number of items per agent), we'll proceed with a more heuristic approach to find a solution that minimizes envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 26, 3, 30, 49, 63, 6
- Agent 1 values items: 98, 27, 10, 49, 22, 40
- Agent 2 values items: 41, 19, 95, 6, 22, 51

One possible approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation differences among agents, ensuring each agent receives a fair share while minimizing envy. Below is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 since they value it the highest (63) compared to others.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest (98).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest (95).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as they have the next highest valuation (49) after Agent 1, who already received item 0.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as they value it more (40) compared to Agent 2 (51) and Agent 0 (6).
6. Lastly, assign item 1 to Agent 2 as they have the highest remaining valuation (19) for this item.

The resulting allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item they highly value.
