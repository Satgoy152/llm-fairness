Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  12  78  89  53  76  91
1  72  42  75  67  94  19
2  43   4  58  85  49  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 42 75 67 94 19]
 [43  4 58 85 49 25]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a collection of items that minimizes envy. One approach to achieve this is by trying to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets one or more items.

Let's evaluate the best allocation based on the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 12     | 78     | 89     | 53     | 76     | 91     |
| 1     | 72     | 42     | 75     | 67     | 94     | 19     |
| 2     | 43     | 4      | 58     | 85     | 49     | 25     |

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation.

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation items are 5, 2, and 1. Assign items 1, 2, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation items are 0 and 4. Assign items 0 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation for item 3 among all items left.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 3

The allocations are as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3]
}
```
