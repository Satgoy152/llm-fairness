Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  16   8  26  90  66
1  28  97  82  28  35  63
2  71  57  67  90  85  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their valuation. Hereâ€™s one possible approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 67 + 16 + 8 + 26 + 90 + 66 = 273
   - Agent 1: 28 + 97 + 82 + 28 + 35 + 63 = 333
   - Agent 2: 71 + 57 + 67 + 90 + 85 + 65 = 435

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (value 90) and item 0 (value 67) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (value 97) and item 2 (value 82) highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 (value 90) and item 4 (value 85) highly.

3. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because they value it the highest.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it the highest.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because they value it the highest.

4. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since they have a relatively good valuation for it (71).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it (82).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, who values it reasonably (66).

After these assignments, we have distributed all 6 items. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, aiming for envy-freeness.
