Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  91  48  96  61   6
1  53  74  57  68  36  10
2   3  56  47   7  80  74
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 74 57 68 36 10]
 [ 3 56 47  7 80 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents according to their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the complexity of finding a perfectly envy-free allocation, especially with integer constraints, we can aim for a solution that minimizes envy.

Let's summarize the situation:

Agent valuations:

- Agent 0: [1, 91, 48, 96, 61, 6]
- Agent 1: [53, 74, 57, 68, 36, 10]
- Agent 2: [3, 56, 47, 7, 80, 74]

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring an allocation that maximizes total utility. However, we must ensure that each agent receives at least one item to achieve a more balanced allocation. Let's proceed with this allocation strategy:

1. Item 0: Valuations are 1 (Agent 0), 53 (Agent 1), and 3 (Agent 2). Assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Valuations are 91 (Agent 0), 74 (Agent 1), and 56 (Agent 2). Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Valuations are 48 (Agent 0), 57 (Agent 1), and 47 (Agent 2). Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Valuations are 96 (Agent 0), 68 (Agent 1), and 7 (Agent 2). Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Valuations are 61 (Agent 0), 36 (Agent 1), and 80 (Agent 2). Assign to Agent 2.
6. Item 5: Valuations are 6 (Agent 0), 10 (Agent 1), and 74 (Agent 2). Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we aim to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
