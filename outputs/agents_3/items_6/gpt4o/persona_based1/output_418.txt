Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  52  50  82  88  72
1  20  20  50  39  79  19
2  98  79  43  27  33  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a manner that promotes fairness and envy-freeness, we will aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations. One way to achieve this is to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (88) and Item 3 (82).
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0 to maximize their perceived value.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (50) and Item 4 (79). However, Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next best option is Item 2 (50), Item 1 (20), and Item 5 (19).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98) and Item 1 (79).
   - Allocate these to Agent 2.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 1.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their respective valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
