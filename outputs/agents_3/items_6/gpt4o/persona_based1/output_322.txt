Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  69  57  43  97   4
1  68  20  43  34  22  93
2  56  81  28  95  49  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 69 57 43 97  4]
 [68 20 43 34 22 93]
 [56 81 28 95 49 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

Let's look at the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 83     | 69     | 57     | 43     | 97     | 4      |
| 1     | 68     | 20     | 43     | 34     | 22     | 93     |
| 2     | 56     | 81     | 28     | 95     | 49     | 22     |

To develop an allocation, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Highest Valuations:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations by a single agent compared to the others. Start by assigning these items to the respective agents.

2. **Assign Items:**
    - Item 4: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 97.
    - Item 3: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 95.
    - Item 5: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 93.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
    - Item 0: Agent 0 values this item at 83, which is the highest.
    - Item 1: Agent 2 values this item at 81, which is the highest.
    - Item 2: Agent 0 values this item at 57, which is the highest.

Considering the above allocations, the total allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```
