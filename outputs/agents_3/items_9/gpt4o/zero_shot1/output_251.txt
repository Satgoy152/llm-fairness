Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98   5  10  35  31  35  27  34  60
1  38  93  55  77  69  16  52  86  76
2  77  77  47  59  93  56  92  86  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 77 47 59 93 56 92 86 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. A fair allocation strategy could be to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring the allocation is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 (value: 98)
   - Item 3 (value: 35)
   - Item 4 (value: 31)
   
   Total valuation for Agent 0 = 98 + 35 + 31 = 164

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1 (value: 93)
   - Item 2 (value: 55)
   - Item 8 (value: 76)
   
   Total valuation for Agent 1 = 93 + 55 + 76 = 224

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 5 (value: 56)
   - Item 6 (value: 92)
   - Item 7 (value: 86)
   
   Total valuation for Agent 2 = 56 + 92 + 86 = 234

This allocation balances the items among the agents and provides a fair distribution based on the given valuations. The total number of items allocated is 9, which matches the requirement.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
