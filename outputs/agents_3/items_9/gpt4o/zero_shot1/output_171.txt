Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  49  69  66  17  43  40  68  78
1  22  95  88  98  27  22  65  75   7
2  18  42  55   3   3  22  80  85   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. First, let's identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Then, assign items to agents starting with the highest-valued items, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total items.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0's highest-valued items: 8 (78), 2 (69), 7 (68)
- Agent 1's highest-valued items: 3 (98), 1 (95), 2 (88)
- Agent 2's highest-valued items: 7 (85), 6 (80), 2 (55)

A potential fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 4] (values: 8, 69, 17)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 5] (values: 95, 98, 22)
- Agent 2: Items [6, 7, 8] (values: 80, 85, 9)

This ensures that each agent gets three items, and the allocation is based on maximizing their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
