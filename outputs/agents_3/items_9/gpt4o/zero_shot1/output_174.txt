Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  37  57  94  49  23  97  27  48
1  50  55   6  20  60  23  36  86  31
2  16  37  74  41  95  47  84  49  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total utilities for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. One approach is to look at the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is as balanced as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest values**: Items 3 (value 94) and 6 (value 97).
2. **Agent 1's highest values**: Items 1 (value 55) and 7 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2's highest values**: Items 4 (value 95) and 2 (value 74).

Now, we have 3 items left (0, 5, 8) to allocate among the agents:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value 50).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value 47).
- **Item 8**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value 48).

Final allocation considering the above analysis:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 7, 0],
    "2": [4, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
