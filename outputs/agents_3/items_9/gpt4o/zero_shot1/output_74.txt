Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  91  48  31  19   1  45  86  76
1  78   7   1  44  80  59  22  45  39
2  65  41  59  54  42  68  16  77  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Below is one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 and 7, so it would be beneficial to allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 4, so it would be suitable to allocate these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 5, 3, and 2, so these items can be allocated to Agent 2.

After considering high-value items for each agent, we then allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent receives a total of 3 items:

- **Agent 0** could also receive item 6.
- **Agent 1** could also receive item 8.
- **Agent 2** could also receive item 2.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 3, 2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 7, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 4, and 8.
- Agent 2 receives items 5, 3, and 2.

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's total value relative to the others, given the constraints.
