Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  48   0  60  97  72  78  51  98
1  42  69  15  82  43  71  81   3  55
2  93  82  65  11  93  23   9  31  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 82 65 11 93 23  9 31 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items they value highly, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: item 8 (98), item 4 (97), item 3 (60)
   - Allocate items: [8, 4, 3]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: item 3 (82), item 6 (81), item 1 (69)
   - Since item 3 is already allocated, we choose the next highest available: item 5 (71)
   - Allocate items: [6, 1, 5]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: item 0 (93), item 4 (93), item 1 (82)
   - Since items 4 and 1 are already allocated, next available is item 2 (65)
   - Allocate items: [0, 2, 7]

After this allocation, all 9 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4, 3],
    "1": [6, 1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```
