Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  76   1  74  12  31  41  80   2
1  63  60  23  60  64  57  44  92  25
2  45  11  79  41  12  98  29  42  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Consideration**:
   - Each agent should receive a minimum of 3 items because there are 9 items and 3 agents.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent first, then allocate remaining items considering the next highest value for the agents who have fewer items.

   **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 7 (80)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (76)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (74)

   **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 7 (92), but already taken.
   - Next highest: Item 4 (64)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (63)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (60)

   **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (98)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (79)
   - Next highest: Item 8 (51)

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has approximately equal value:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to balance the number of items and their total valuation.
