Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  64   4  19  50  14  93  16  87
1  74  88  46  59  16  48  12   6   4
2  24  13  33  63  76  35  71  74  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent while also ensuring that each agent gets a somewhat balanced share of items. We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the highest values Agent 0 places on items, they value items 6 (93), 8 (87), and 1 (64) highly. We can start by giving them these items.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 1 (88), 0 (74), and 3 (59). Since item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 1. Additionally, item 4 (16) is not valued much by other agents, so it can be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 4 (76), 7 (74), and 3 (63) highly. Since item 4 is already allocated, we can allocate items 7 and 2 (33) to Agent 2. Additionally, item 5 (35) can be allocated to Agent 2 since it is not highly valued by others.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 6, 8, and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 2, 5, and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 1],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
