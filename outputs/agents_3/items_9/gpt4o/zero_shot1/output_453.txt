Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  84  13  49  82  88  82  69  30
1  95  62  67  51  15  20  52  29  14
2   7  88   0  82   9  43  65  88  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 88  0 82  9 43 65 88 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's try the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their value.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that maximize their value.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that maximize their value.

Let's evaluate and allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (84), 5 (88), and 0 (82). Allocate these items.
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 (95), 2 (67), and 3 (51). Allocate these items.
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 7 (88), 6 (65), and 8 (71). Allocate these items.

Now let's ensure the allocation meets the criteria:

- Agent 0: [1, 5, 4] (values are 84, 88, 82)
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3] (values are 95, 67, 51)
- Agent 2: [7, 6, 8] (values are 88, 65, 71)

This allocation is fair because each agent receives 3 items, and their valuations for these items are relatively high.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [7, 6, 8]
}
```
