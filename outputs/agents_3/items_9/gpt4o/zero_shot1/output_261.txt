Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  94  82  42  88  72   3  55  17
1  95  29  74  75  74  30  12  22  37
2  67  29  84   6  89  29  22  30  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Given the valuations provided, the goal is to assign items to agents such that:

1. Each agent gets an integer number of items.
2. All 9 items are allocated.
3. The allocation is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations.

We can use a simple greedy algorithm approach to achieve this:

1. Go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets roughly an equal number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest (95).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest (94).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest (84).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest (75).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest (89).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (72).
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the highest (22).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest (55).
9. Item 8: Agent 2 values it the highest (78).

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 6, 8

Adjustments need to be made to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Let's make a fair adjustment:

1. Swap item 6 from Agent 2 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation better.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, 7, 8

This ensures a fair distribution among the agents. Now, here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
