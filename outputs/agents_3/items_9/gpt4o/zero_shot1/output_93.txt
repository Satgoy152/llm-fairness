Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  15  33   9  48  79  61  22  21
1  27  66   3  67  27  96  23  68  99
2  91  99  49  11  76  27  48  66  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 99 49 11 76 27 48 66 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and distribute items to maximize the sum of valuations.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of exactly 9 items allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [52, 15, 33, 9, 48, 79, 61, 22, 21]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [27, 66, 3, 67, 27, 96, 23, 68, 99]
- Agent 2 values the items as: [91, 99, 49, 11, 76, 27, 48, 66, 43]

By evaluating the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 5 (79), 6 (61), and 0 (52)
- Agent 1 highly values items: 8 (99), 5 (96), and 3 (67)
- Agent 2 highly values items: 1 (99), 0 (91), and 4 (76)

Attempting to distribute the highest value items to each agent:

Allocation strategy:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (96 is higher than 79 from Agent 0).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (99 is highest).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (67 is highest).

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (99 is highest).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (76 is higher than Agent 0's 48).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (91 is highest).

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (61 is highest after removing others).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (33 is highest after removing others).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (22 is highest after removing others).

With this allocation, each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
