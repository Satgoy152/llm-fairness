Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  82   8  47  95  50  99   6  59
1  83  70  74  24  42  76  40  15  26
2  11  87  75  85   3   9   7  41  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common approach is to try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation considering fairness and maximizing individual agent values:

### Step 1: Determine the highest valued items for each agent

- **Agent 0** values: 
  - Highest: Item 6 (99)
  - Second highest: Item 4 (95)
  - Third highest: Item 1 (82)

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Highest: Item 0 (83)
  - Second highest: Item 5 (76)
  - Third highest: Item 2 (74)

- **Agent 2** values:
  - Highest: Item 3 (85)
  - Second highest: Item 1 (87)
  - Third highest: Item 2 (75)

### Step 2: Assign items based on preference, ensuring each agent gets 3 items

After evaluating each agent's preferences and ensuring no conflicts in the highest valued items, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items: 6, 4, 1

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items: 0, 5, 2

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items: 3, 7, 8

### Step 3: Present the allocations in JSON format

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 1],
    "1": [0, 5, 2],
    "2": [3, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.
