Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  87  85  47  79  61  53  22  49
1  99  62  98  90  18  59  85  41   4
2  84  86   1  58  21  89  84  23  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuations:

1. Item 0 (values: 8, 99, 84) is allocated to Agent 1.
2. Item 1 (values: 87, 62, 86) is allocated to Agent 0.
3. Item 2 (values: 85, 98, 1) is allocated to Agent 1.
4. Item 3 (values: 47, 90, 58) is allocated to Agent 1.
5. Item 4 (values: 79, 18, 21) is allocated to Agent 0.
6. Item 5 (values: 61, 59, 89) is allocated to Agent 2.
7. Item 6 (values: 53, 85, 84) is allocated to Agent 1.
8. Item 7 (values: 22, 41, 23) is allocated to Agent 1.
9. Item 8 (values: 49, 4, 70) is allocated to Agent 2.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives an integer number of items (i.e., distribute items as evenly as possible):

- Agent 0 currently has items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 currently has items 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- Agent 2 currently has items 5 and 8.

Agent 1 has five items, whereas Agents 0 and 2 have two items each. We can adjust by transferring one item from Agent 1 to Agent 0 or 2. Let's transfer item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 0:

- Agent 0: items 1, 4, 7.
- Agent 1: items 0, 2, 3, 6.
- Agent 2: items 5, 8.

This gives each agent an integer number of items (3, 4, and 2 items respectively), with all 9 items allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "2": [5, 8]
}
```
