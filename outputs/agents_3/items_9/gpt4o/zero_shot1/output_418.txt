Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  40  49  79  71   1  95   6  56
1  33  18  64  25  28  47  85  84  32
2   3  71  34  78  39  54  91  79  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. 

Let's start by examining the highest value item for each agent and proceed to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items are: Item 6 (95), Item 3 (79), Item 4 (71)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items are: Item 6 (85), Item 7 (84), Item 2 (64)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items are: Item 6 (91), Item 3 (78), Item 1 (71)

To ensure a fair allocation, we need to carefully consider the distribution while maximizing the total value for each agent. Since Item 6 is highly valued by all agents, we need to allocate it carefully. 

Let's proceed as follows:

- **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2**: Since Agent 2 values it highly and Agent 0 has already received Item 6.
- **Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1**: It's the second-highest valued by Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**: It's the third-highest valued by Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2**: It's highly valued by Agent 2 and Agent 0 has received two items already.
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: It's highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: To balance the number of items received.
- **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1**: To balance the number of items received.
- **Allocate Item 8 to Agent 2**: To ensure all items are allocated and balance the number of items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, maximizing the total value based on their preferences.
