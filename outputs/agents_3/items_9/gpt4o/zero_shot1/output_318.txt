Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  32  69  69   0  51  58  69  46
1  31  29  62  30   2  46  47  16  25
2   5  27  11  25  30  25  59   8   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to ensure that each agent's total value is maximized while distributing the items as evenly as possible. Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate total value each agent would get if they received each item.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring no agent receives significantly more items than others.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 (69), item 3 (69), and item 7 (69) highly, as well as item 6 (58).
- Agent 1 values item 2 (62) and item 5 (46) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 (59) highly.

With these considerations, we can propose an allocation where each agent gets three items, aiming to maximize their total valuation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 2, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 0, 5, and 8.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 1, 4, and 6.

This allocation gives each agent three items and maximizes their valuation accordingly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
