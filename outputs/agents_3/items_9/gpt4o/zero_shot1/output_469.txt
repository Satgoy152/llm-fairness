Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  33  80  14   0  51  47   3  61
1  41  30  96  19  82  47  31  17  93
2  48  94  49  78  24  63   5  77   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value of the items each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (88), Item 2 (80), Item 8 (61)
   - Allocate items: 0, 2, 8

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (96), Item 4 (82), Item 8 (93)
   - Item 2 and 8 are already allocated. 
   - Next highest: Item 5 (47), Item 3 (19)
   - Allocate items: 4, 5, 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (94), Item 3 (78), Item 7 (77)
   - Item 1, 3, and 7 are unallocated.
   - Allocate items: 1, 3, 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets some high-value items according to their valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
