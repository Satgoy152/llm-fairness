Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  71  20  76  56  43  17   7  73
1  94  87  58  29  35  76  47  34  95
2  90  18  14   0  75  63   7  51  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives a fair share. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free Allocation" method, which aims to minimize envy among the agents. However, due to the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we can aim for a reasonable allocation where each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0: 4
   - Agent 1: 94
   - Agent 2: 90
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0: 71
   - Agent 1: 87
   - Agent 2: 18
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0: 20
   - Agent 1: 58
   - Agent 2: 14
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0: 76
   - Agent 1: 29
   - Agent 2: 0
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0: 56
   - Agent 1: 35
   - Agent 2: 75
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0: 43
   - Agent 1: 76
   - Agent 2: 63
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0: 17
   - Agent 1: 47
   - Agent 2: 7
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0: 7
   - Agent 1: 34
   - Agent 2: 51
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

9. **Item 8**:
   - Agent 0: 73
   - Agent 1: 95
   - Agent 2: 91
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    "2": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and that 9 items are allocated in total.
