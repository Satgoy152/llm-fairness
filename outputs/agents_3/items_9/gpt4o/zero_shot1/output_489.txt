Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  76   1  85  30  83  30  15   8
1  55  31  69  99  22  22  81  32  23
2  66  47  55  62  82   1   2  96  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider both the agents' valuations and the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items. There are many ways to consider fairness, such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets a similar number of items, or ensuring each agent gets items they value highly. 

Here is one possible allocation strategy. We will attempt to allocate items so that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that all items are assigned:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the highest that's still available.
2. Repeat step 1 until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (value 85). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (value 99), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 81). Assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (value 82). Assign item 4 to agent 2.

Continue this process:

- Agent 0's next highest available item is item 5 (value 83). Assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest available item is item 2 (value 69). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest available item is item 7 (value 96). Assign item 7 to agent 2.

Continue:

- Agent 0's next highest available item is item 1 (value 76). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1's next highest available item is item 0 (value 55). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2's next highest available item is item 8 (value 76). Assign item 8 to agent 2.

Now all items (0 through 8) are allocated:

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1],
    "1": [6, 2, 0],
    "2": [4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring that every item is allocated.
