Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  68  32  70  70  83  65  25  39
1  42  16  13  69   7  71  27  60  49
2  75  81  51  38  32  75  36  68  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally each agent should receive 3 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 5, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations on items 5, 7, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations on items 8, 1, and 0.

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, we can allocate as follows:

- Assign items based on the highest valuations first, while trying to ensure each agent gets 3 items.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** receives items 5, 3, and 4.
- **Agent 1** receives items 7, 6, and 2.
- **Agent 2** receives items 8, 1, and 0.

These allocations ensure that the items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 4],
    "1": [7, 6, 2],
    "2": [8, 1, 0]
}
```
