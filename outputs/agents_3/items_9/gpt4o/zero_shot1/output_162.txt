Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  25  10  11  61  16  25  79  43
1  16  48  94  88  29  87  63  91  87
2  19  75  93  61  52  48  18  65  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an approximately equal value based on their preferences. We have to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Agent 0: 45 + 25 + 10 + 11 + 61 + 16 + 25 + 79 + 43 = 315
   - Agent 1: 16 + 48 + 94 + 88 + 29 + 87 + 63 + 91 + 87 = 613
   - Agent 2: 19 + 75 + 93 + 61 + 52 + 48 + 18 + 65 + 79 = 510

2. **Determine the fair share for each agent**:
   - Total value of all items = 315 + 613 + 510 = 1438
   - Average value per agent = 1438 / 3 â‰ˆ 479.33

3. **Assign items based on preferences while trying to balance the total value assigned to each agent**:
   - Assign the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as close as possible to the average.

4. **Propose an allocation**:

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 4, 7] with values [45, 61, 79] = Total value 185
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 5, 8] with values [94, 88, 87, 87] = Total value 356
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 6] with values [75, 18] = Total value 93

5. **Adjust the allocation to ensure fairness and balance**:
   - Re-allocate items to balance the total values closer to the average.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 5, 7] with values [45, 16, 79] = Total value 140
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 8] with values [94, 88, 87] = Total value 269
   - Agent 2: Items [1, 4, 6] with values [75, 52, 18] = Total value 145

7. **Build the JSON output**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
