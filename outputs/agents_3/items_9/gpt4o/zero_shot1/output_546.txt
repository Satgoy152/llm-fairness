Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  45  94  65  94  38  94  95  91
1  32  15  26  26  19  64  76  29  42
2  76  10  22  54  95  47  55  34  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's total value if they were to receive all items, then proceed to assign items to maximize the total value each agent receives.

2. Prioritize items to agents based on the highest value for that item.

Here's one such allocation:

- Agent 0 tends to value items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 highly.

- Agent 1 is particularly interested in item 5 and item 6.

- Agent 2 values item 0, item 6, and item 4 highly.

Considering these preferences, we can distribute the items as follows to balance between agents:

- Give Agent 0 items: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Give Agent 1 items: 5, 6
- Give Agent 2 items: 4, 7, 8

This allocation takes into account the values each agent places on the items while ensuring an equitable distribution of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4, 7, 8]
}
```
