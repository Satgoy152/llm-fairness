Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  38  75  20  34  14  66  18  57
1  65  66  24  18  92  46  62  72  20
2   5   0  92  87  75  22  66  59  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring that all items are distributed.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent is supposed to receive (3 items each in this case, since there are 9 items and 3 agents).

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item Allocation by Highest Value:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 65, and Agent 2 at 5. So, allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 66, and Agent 2 at 0. So, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 24, and Agent 2 at 92. So, allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 18, and Agent 2 at 87. So, allocate to Agent 2.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 92, and Agent 2 at 75. So, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 46, and Agent 2 at 22. So, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 at 62, and Agent 2 at 66. Both Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it equally, but to balance allocations:
     - Allocate to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 and Agent 2 will both end up with 3 items each).
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 72, and Agent 2 at 59. So, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 20, and Agent 2 at 31. So, allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets 3 Items:**

   After the initial allocation, we may need to adjust to ensure each agent receives exactly 3 items. However, the above allocation method should already ensure each agent receives 3 items due to the constraints.

3. **Check and Adjust:**

   Verify the allocation to ensure:
   - Each agent has exactly 3 items.
   - All items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.
