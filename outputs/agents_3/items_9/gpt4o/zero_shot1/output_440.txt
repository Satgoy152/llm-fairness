Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  26  97  81   5  24   1  14   8
1  38  67  21  71  31  33  41   9  84
2  89  87  71  60  34  48  76   6  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. One approach is to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations for each item, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Consider items that Agent 0 values highly compared to other agents.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 97 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 59 (second highest, but since Agent 2 has other high values, it's fair to allocate to Agent 0).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Consider items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 67 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 31 (highest among all agents).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate remaining items to Agent 2.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 48 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 76 (highest among all agents).
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 6 (no other choices remain).

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0],
    "1": [1, 8, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
