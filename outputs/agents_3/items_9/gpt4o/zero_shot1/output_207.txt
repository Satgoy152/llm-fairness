Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  33  17  41  25  86  64  30  92
1  90  71  69   7  60  45  50  89  60
2  97  22  11  63  95  34  74   8  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 33 17 41 25 86 64 30 92]
 [90 71 69  7 60 45 50 89 60]
 [97 22 11 63 95 34 74  8 93]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations given by each agent. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets exactly three items since there are three agents and nine items.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items where agent 0 has relatively high valuations compared to the other agents.
   - Item 7 (value 30)
   - Item 8 (value 92)
   - Item 3 (value 41)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items where agent 1's valuations are relatively high.
   - Item 0 (value 90)
   - Item 1 (value 71)
   - Item 6 (value 50)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items, where agent 2 has some of the highest valuations.
   - Item 2 (value 11)
   - Item 4 (value 95)
   - Item 5 (value 34)

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting three items and the total number of items allocated is nine.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5]
}
```
