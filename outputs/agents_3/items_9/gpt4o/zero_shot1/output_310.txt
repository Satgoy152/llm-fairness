Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  13  59  24  81  15  31  78  93
1  26  86  88  55  79  30   8  14  39
2  38  17  80  56  95  28  40  82  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 13 59 24 81 15 31 78 93]

 [38 17 80 56 95 28 40 82 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets a whole number of items. We need to make sure that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations for each agent and distribute the items to balance the total value:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values: [19, 13, 59, 24, 81, 15, 31, 78, 93]
   - Agent 1 values: [26, 86, 88, 55, 79, 30, 8, 14, 39]
   - Agent 2 values: [38, 17, 80, 56, 95, 28, 40, 82, 36]

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least 2 items since there are 3 agents and 9 items.

3. **Item Allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (38), item 1 to Agent 1 (86), item 2 to Agent 1 (88)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (56), item 4 to Agent 2 (95), item 5 to Agent 1 (30)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (40), item 7 to Agent 0 (78), item 8 to Agent 0 (93)

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 7, 8
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4, 6

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent gets at least 2 items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
