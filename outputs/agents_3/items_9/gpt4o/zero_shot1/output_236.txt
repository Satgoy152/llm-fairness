Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  66  79  34  47  93  99  23  77
1  66  87  46  59  61  20  62  67  41
2  33  61  85  99  43  76  27  24  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items while maximizing their satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Look for the highest valuation each agent has for any item. This helps ensure that each agent is likely to receive at least one item they value highly.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations**:
    - Agent 0 has the highest value of 99 for item 6.
    - Agent 1 has the highest value of 87 for item 1.
    - Agent 2 has the highest value of 99 for item 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Initially allocated item 6 (value 99). Also allocate items 2 (value 79), and 0 (value 40).
- **Agent 1**: Initially allocated item 1 (value 87). Also allocate items 4 (value 61), and 8 (value 41).
- **Agent 2**: Initially allocated item 3 (value 99). Also allocate items 5 (value 76), and 7 (value 24).

The allocation ensures that each agent gets a significant total value from the items they receive.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with three items, ensuring a fair distribution while considering the values they attribute to each item.
