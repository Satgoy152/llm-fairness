Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  30  27  99  70  19  90  22  87
1  27  55  10  49  63  31  94  11   1
2  95  34  91  76  40  86  50  27  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[38 30 27 99 70 19 90 22 87]

 [95 34 91 76 40 86 50 27 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we should consider both the total valuation each agent has for different items and attempt to balance these allocations so each agent receives a fair amount of value. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 (99), 6 (90), and 8 (87). To maximize fairness while keeping their valuations high, we'll assign these items to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has relatively high valuations for items 1 (55) and 6 (94). However, since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, we'll assign item 1 to Agent 1. We'll also assign items 4 (63) and 5 (31) to balance the distribution.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has very high valuations for items 0 (95), 2 (91), and 5 (86). Since item 5 has been assigned to Agent 1, we'll assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 2. We'll also add item 7 (27) to balance the allocations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the total value, and all 9 items are allocated.
