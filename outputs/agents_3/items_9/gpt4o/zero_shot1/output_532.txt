Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  57  40  50  84   0  14  18  61
1  23  21  10  77  52  13  80  37  78
2  38  89  78  64  80  99  83  30  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items that Agent 0 values highly, such as items 4, 8, and perhaps 1, to maximize their total value.

2. **Agent 1**: Look for items that Agent 1 values highly, like items 3 and 6, to provide them with a strong allocation.

3. **Agent 2**: Since Agent 2 has high valuations for several items, items 5, 2, and 0 could be considered to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's allocate the items based on the values:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 8 (Value: 84, 61 respectively)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 6 (Value: 77, 80 respectively)
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 2, 0, 1, 7 (Value: 99, 78, 38, 89, 30 respectively)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items, and all items are accounted for:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 2, 0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on the highest valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.
