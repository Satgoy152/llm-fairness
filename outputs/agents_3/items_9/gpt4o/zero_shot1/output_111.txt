Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  38  52  23  28  30  27  82   8
1  14  83  99  55  52  39  29  68  47
2  61  74   2  43  70  44  59  21  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 74  2 43 70 44 59 21 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the items so that each agent gets a roughly equal share in terms of their valuations. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - This agent values item 0 highly (84), and item 7 (82), which are the highest values for this agent. 
   - Assign items 0 and 7 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - This agent values item 2 the most (99), which is the highest value for any item among all agents.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1. 
   - Agent 1 also has high values for items 1 (83) and 3 (55).
   - Assign items 1 and 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - This agent has the highest value for item 8 (89) and a relatively high value for item 4 (70).
   - Assign items 4 and 8 to agent 2.
   - Agent 2 also has a decent value for item 5 (44) and item 6 (59).
   - Assign items 5 and 6 to agent 2.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations, with each agent receiving a fair share.
