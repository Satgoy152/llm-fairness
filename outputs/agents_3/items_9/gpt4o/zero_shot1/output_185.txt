Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2  3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  14  70  8  68  36  34  22  33
1  76   5  39  9  31  16  87  68  92
2   7  78  89  6  96  36  69  40  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 78 89  6 96 36 69 40 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction or value from the items they receive. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that is as fair as possible, considering the agents' preferences.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2: Value 70
   - Item 4: Value 68
   - Item 5: Value 36

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 6: Value 87
   - Item 8: Value 92

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Value 78
   - Item 3: Value 6
   - Item 7: Value 40
   - Item 0: Value 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 7, 0]
}
```
