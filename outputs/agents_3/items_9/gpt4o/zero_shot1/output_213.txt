Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55   4  52   1  31   4   8   6   6
1  63  58  53  17  38  95  61  30  65
2  32  76  37  67  72  81  91  18  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the valuations to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1, 6, and 5.

To ensure fairness, we will consider each agent's top preferences and attempt to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes their individual satisfaction while keeping the distribution as equal as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - High preference for item 0 (55), item 2 (52), and item 4 (31).
- **Agent 1**: 
  - High preference for item 5 (95), item 1 (58), and item 8 (65).
- **Agent 2**: 
  - High preference for item 6 (91), item 3 (67), and item 7 (18).

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Gets items [0, 2, 4]. These items have relatively high valuations for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Gets items [5, 1, 8]. These items are among the highest valued for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Gets items [6, 3, 7]. These items are highly valued by Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the items assigned to each agent are among the higher-valued choices for them.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [5, 1, 8],
    "2": [6, 3, 7]
}
```
