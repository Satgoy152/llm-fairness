Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  67  86  72  26  61  44  99  45
1  56  56   6  71  55  99  28  74  50
2  76  30  42   8  43  79  26  34  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's aim to maximize the valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider each agent's preference and attempt to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is balanced.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 7
   - Valuations: 62 (item 0), 72 (item 3), 99 (item 7)
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 233

2. **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5, 8
   - Valuations: 56 (item 1), 99 (item 5), 50 (item 8)
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 205

3. **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4, 6
   - Valuations: 42 (item 2), 43 (item 4), 26 (item 6)
   - Total valuation for Agent 2: 111

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated. 

The final allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
