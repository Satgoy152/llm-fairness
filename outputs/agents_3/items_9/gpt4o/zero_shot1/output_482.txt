Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  92  49  33  42   0  12  37  87
1  96  59  52  13  33  23  80  86  34
2  43  26  50  89  66  53  98  67  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 92 49 33 42  0 12 37 87]
 [96 59 52 13 33 23 80 86 34]
 [43 26 50 89 66 53 98 67 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations table, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 8. Allocating these items to Agent 0 will maximize their utility.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 7. Allocating these items to Agent 1 will maximize their utility.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5. Allocating these items to Agent 2 will maximize their utility.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 1, 8]
- **Agent 1** gets items [2, 6, 7]
- **Agent 2** gets items [3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [2, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
