Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92   5  27   9  61  64  55   1  46
1  94  87  17   2  80  97  43  24  80
2  29   2  42  32  65  32  62  28  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's go through the process step by step:

### Total Number of Items and Agents:
- Total items: 9
- Total agents: 3

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation item: 0 (value 92)
   - Next highest: 5 (value 64)
   - Next highest: 4 (value 61)
   - Allocated items to Agent 0: [0, 5, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation item: 5 (value 97, but it's already allocated)
   - Next highest: 0 (value 94, but it's already allocated)
   - Next highest: 1 (value 87)
   - Next highest: 4 (value 80, but it's already allocated)
   - Next highest: 8 (value 80)
   - Allocated items to Agent 1: [1, 8]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation item: 6 (value 62)
   - Next highest: 4 (value 65, but it's already allocated)
   - Next highest: 2 (value 42)
   - Allocated items to Agent 2: [6, 2]

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 3 and 7 are unallocated.
   - Agent 0 has 3 items, Agent 1 has 2 items, and Agent 2 has 2 items.
   - Allocate remaining items to balance allocations:
     - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 2)
     - Agent 2: Item 7 (value 28)

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 4],
    "1": [1, 8, 3],
    "2": [6, 2, 7]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, maximizing their valuations based on the given data.
