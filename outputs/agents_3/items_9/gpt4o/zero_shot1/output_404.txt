Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  31  96  30  42  99  91   5  27
1  42  76  53  12   1  36  17  61  73
2   9  31  12  57  49   0  59  82  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get 3 items. Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. Identify the highest value an agent has for any item, and allocate that item to the respective agent if it hasn't been allocated already.
2. Repeat the process, ensuring each agent gets approximately the same number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Highest value items: Item 5 (99), Item 2 (96), Item 6 (91)
- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest value items: Item 1 (76), Item 8 (73), Item 7 (61)
- **Agent 2:**
  - Highest value items: Item 7 (82), Item 3 (57), Item 6 (59)

Now, we ensure each agent gets 3 items by adjusting for any overlaps and based on next highest preferences:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items 0, 2, and 5.
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 1, 4, and 8.
- **Agent 2:** Gets items 3, 6, and 7.

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives 3 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and the constraint of distributing all 9 items among the 3 agents.
