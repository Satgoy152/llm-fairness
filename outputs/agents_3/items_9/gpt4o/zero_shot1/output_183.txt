Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  92  38  10  69  25  95  58  86
1  94  15  72   5  86  33  95   4   9
2  20  99  45  25  32  26  72  61  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 3 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of items based on their valuations. This can be done using a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's first analyze the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 34 + 92 + 38 + 10 + 69 + 25 + 95 + 58 + 86 = 507
- Agent 1: 94 + 15 + 72 + 5 + 86 + 33 + 95 + 4 + 9 = 413
- Agent 2: 20 + 99 + 45 + 25 + 32 + 26 + 72 + 61 + 83 = 463

We will try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to their fair share. A fair share can be considered as the total value divided by the number of agents, which is approximately:

- Total value: 507 + 413 + 463 = 1383
- Fair share per agent: 1383 / 3 = 461

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Choose items with highest valuations: [1, 6, 8]
   - Total value: 92 + 95 + 86 = 273

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Choose items with highest valuations: [0, 4, 2]
   - Total value: 94 + 86 + 72 = 252

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Choose remaining items: [3, 5, 7]
   - Total value: 25 + 26 + 61 = 112

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 3 items, and while the total values may not be perfectly equal, they are distributed in a way that respects their individual valuations as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
