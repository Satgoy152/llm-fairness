Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50   3   5  29  89  49   2  66  61
1  12   3  91  30  47  79  48  26  97
2   8  16   6  75  45  94  62  56  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least some items and all 9 items are allocated. Let's go through the process step by step and then provide the final allocation.

**Agent 0 Valuations:**
- Items: [50, 3, 5, 29, 89, 49, 2, 66, 61]

**Agent 1 Valuations:**
- Items: [12, 3, 91, 30, 47, 79, 48, 26, 97]

**Agent 2 Valuations:**
- Items: [8, 16, 6, 75, 45, 94, 62, 56, 56]

**Strategy:**
- We will try to allocate items by considering the highest relative valuations for each agent.
- We will also ensure each agent receives at least some items, and no items are repeated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (89), Item 7 (66), Item 0 (50)
   - Allocate: Items [4, 7, 0]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values not taken by Agent 0: Item 8 (97), Item 2 (91)
   - Allocate: Items [8, 2]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values not taken by Agent 0 or 1: Item 5 (94), Item 3 (75), Item 6 (62), Item 1 (16)
   - Allocate: Items [5, 3, 6, 1]

Total items allocated: 9

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 0],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [5, 3, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items while maximizing their individual valuations based on the given data.
