Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  28  16  51  91  50  61  94  37
1  21  79  48  32  61  87  82  70  28
2   2  71  34  74  44  89  30  59  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 28 16 51 91 50 61 94 37]
 [21 79 48 32 61 87 82 70 28]
 [ 2 71 34 74 44 89 30 59 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, while also ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal number of items. Given there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 3 items.

Let's evaluate the assignment:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0's top values: [0: 95, 7: 94, 4: 91]
   - Agent 1's top values: [5: 87, 1: 79, 6: 82]
   - Agent 2's top values: [5: 89, 3: 74, 1: 71]

2. **Allocating based on high preferences:**
   - Agent 0: 
     - 0 (95), 7 (94), 4 (91)
   - Agent 1:
     - 5 (87), 6 (82), 1 (79)
   - Agent 2:
     - 3 (74), 8 (38), 2 (34)

3. **Final Allocation:**

After ensuring each agent receives 3 items and analyzing their preferences, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
