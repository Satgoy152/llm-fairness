Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54   4  90   5  62  24  83  86  56
1  30  58  12  94  41  45  68  44  25
2  36  84  91  12  81  34  22  94  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for an equitable distribution. We'll follow a process that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 54 + 4 + 90 + 5 + 62 + 24 + 83 + 86 + 56 = 464
   - Agent 1: 30 + 58 + 12 + 94 + 41 + 45 + 68 + 44 + 25 = 417
   - Agent 2: 36 + 84 + 91 + 12 + 81 + 34 + 22 + 94 + 91 = 545

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least some allocation.

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (Value: 54)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (Value: 84)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (Value: 91)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (Value: 94)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (Value: 81)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (Value: 45)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (Value: 83)
   - Item 7: Agent 2 (Value: 94)
   - Item 8: Agent 2 (Value: 91)

4. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Agent 2 has received five items. To ensure a fair distribution, we can redistribute one item.
   - Reassign Item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a higher valuation (62) than Agent 1 (41).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 7, 8

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on each agent's valuations.

    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 7, 8]
