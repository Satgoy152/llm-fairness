Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  60  91  15   5  17  92  11  86
1  73  23  12  25   1  18  44  47   6
2  78  48  67  73  43  61  11  55  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a balanced distribution of total valuation values. Here is one possible allocation approach:

1. Start by identifying items with significant differences in valuation among agents to see if they can be easily allocated to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives 3 items since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0 (31), 2 (91), and 6 (92).
- Agent 1 has no extremely high valuation, but relatively higher for items 3 (25), 7 (47), and 5 (18).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (73), along with items 1 (48) and 5 (61).

Letâ€™s allocate based on these observations:

- Allocate items 0, 2, and 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 3, 7, and 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 5, 1, and 8 to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 7, 4],
    "2": [5, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives exactly 3 items and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.
