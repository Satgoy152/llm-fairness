Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  19  92  18  18  87  69  28  98
1  21  29  53  12  87  81   9  88  61
2  84  68  77  13  85  36  41  66  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item for each agent and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. We will look at the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances the total value for each agent.

Here is an approach to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 8.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly and also has a good valuation for item 7.
- Agent 2 values item 0, 2, and 4 highly, but since agent 0 also values these, we can try to balance the distribution by giving agent 2 some other items they value decently.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocating items 0, 8, and 5 (values: 94, 98, 87).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocating items 4, 7, and 1 (values: 87, 88, 29).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocating items 2, 3, and 6 (values: 77, 13, 41).

This allocation tries to balance the distribution of valued items among the agents.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 5],
    "1": [4, 7, 1],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
