Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  59  40  95  18  61  77  93  35
1  61  97  47  54  72  84   5  21  19
2  35  14  72  68  92  95  86  16  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring a balanced distribution. Each agent should receive an approximately equal number of items, given that there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (95), Item 7 (93), Item 5 (61)
   - Allocate Items: 3, 7, 5

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (97), Item 5 (84), Item 4 (72)
   - Allocate Items: 1, 4, 6 (since Item 5 is already allocated)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (95), Item 4 (92), Item 6 (86)
   - Allocate Items: 0, 2, 8

Now, we check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 7, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 8

Each agent receives 3 items, totaling 9 items, which ensures a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 8]
}
```
