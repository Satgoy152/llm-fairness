Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  80  95  64  33  11  70  94  36
1  81  73   2  83  72   1  22   9  74
2  60  67  54  46  82  98  41   7  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all agents get an integer number of items. We will try to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly: 2, 7, 0
- Agent 1 values items highly: 0, 3, 8
- Agent 2 values items highly: 5, 8, 4

Our goal is to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. To achieve this, we can prioritize giving each agent the items they value the most without exceeding the total number of items.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 8]
- Agent 2: [4, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a mix of items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
