Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  79  94  30  38  94  60   3  19
1  18  33  64  39  81   3  53  87  74
2  45  71  67  42  39  43  25  85  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 seems to highly value items 2, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values items 4, 7, and 8.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1, 7, and 8, but we will try to avoid conflicts by choosing other items they value reasonably well.

We will try to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items, avoiding overlap:

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 5, 0 (values: 94, 94, 16)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7, 8 (values: 81, 87, 74)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, 6 (values: 71, 42, 25)

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 0],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives three items.
