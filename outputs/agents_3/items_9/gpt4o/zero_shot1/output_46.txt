Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  33  26  91  45  62  57  63  44
1  16  17   9  29  10  87  75  99   4
2  49  90  83  21  10  49  75  61  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 33 26 91 45 62 57 63 44]
 [16 17  9 29 10 87 75 99  4]
 [49 90 83 21 10 49 75 61 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items to understand their preferences:
   - Agent 0: 42 + 33 + 26 + 91 + 45 + 62 + 57 + 63 + 44 = 463
   - Agent 1: 16 + 17 + 9 + 29 + 10 + 87 + 75 + 99 + 4 = 346
   - Agent 2: 49 + 90 + 83 + 21 + 10 + 49 + 75 + 61 + 89 = 527

2. Sort the items based on each agent's valuation, and try to give each agent the items where they have the highest relative valuation.

3. Allocate the items, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3]. These are among the highest-valued items for Agent 0.
- Agent 1 gets items [7, 5]. These are the highest-valued items for Agent 1.
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 2, 6, 8, 4]. These items provide a fair distribution considering Agent 2's overall higher valuation across many items.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 6, 8, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of their valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated.
