Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  34  80  81  85  87   5  43  72
1  73  50  53  45  23  62  98  85  85
2  27  89  56  90  54  78  89  24   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring an integer number of items is allocated to each agent. Let's proceed to allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are: Item 5 (87), Item 4 (85), and Item 3 (81).
   - Allocate Items: 5, 4, and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are: Item 6 (98), Items 0 (73), and Item 7 (85).
   - Allocate Items: 6, 0, and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items for Agent 2 are: Item 3 (90), Item 1 (89), and Item 6 (89).
   - Since items 3 and 6 are already allocated, allocate next highest value items: Item 1 (89), Item 2 (56), and Item 8 (4).
   - Allocate Items: 1, 2, and 8 to Agent 2.

However, we notice that Item 1 is allocated to Agent 2 and is also one of the highest value items for Agent 1, which we already assigned. To ensure each item is only allocated once, let's revise the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate Items: 5, 4, and 3.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Allocate Items: 6, 0, and 7.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Allocate Items: 1, 2, and 8.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 3],
    "1": [6, 0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 8]
}
```
