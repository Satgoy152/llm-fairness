Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  26  60  46  33   4  52  14  85
1  43  79  62  15  17  16  51  18  36
2  88  23  95  91   9  78  91  80  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 23 95 91  9 78 91 80 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an equitable distribution. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal share in terms of their valuations. Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items 0, 2, 5
   - Total value = 31 + 60 + 4 = 95

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items 1, 4, 7
   - Total value = 79 + 17 + 18 = 114

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items 3, 6, 8
   - Total value = 91 + 91 + 88 = 270

This allocation results in each agent receiving a reasonable number of items, ensuring that the total valuation is as equitable as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6, 8]
}
```
