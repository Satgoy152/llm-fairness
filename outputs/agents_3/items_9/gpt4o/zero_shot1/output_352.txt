Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  85  12  70  85  95  33   4  31
1  87  21  23  78   5  58  82  34  44
2  90  35  53  17  41  71  30  99   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's how the allocations can be made:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Optimal items based on the highest values for Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 3
   - Total valuation for these items: 85 (Item 1) + 95 (Item 5) + 70 (Item 3) = 250

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Optimal items based on the highest values for Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 6
   - Total valuation for these items: 87 (Item 0) + 78 (Item 3) + 82 (Item 6) = 247

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Optimal items based on the highest values for Agent 2: Items 0, 7, 5
   - Total valuation for these items: 90 (Item 0) + 99 (Item 7) + 71 (Item 5) = 260

Given that each item must be allocated to only one agent, and considering the constraints, we can re-distribute based on maximizing each agent's top values while ensuring all items are allocated:

- **Final Allocation:**
  - Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
  - Agent 1: Items [0, 3, 6]
  - Agent 2: Items [2, 4, 7, 8]

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
