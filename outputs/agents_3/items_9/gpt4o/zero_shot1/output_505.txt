Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  49  22  51  57  48  41  56  29
1  38  40  25  49  39  38  73   9  23
2  12  39  63  93  26  30   1  27  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent without leaving any items unallocated. Here's a reasonable allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuations while trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.
2. Each agent should ideally receive 3 items since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 6, 0, and 3 but item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 2, and 8 but item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0.

Considering the above points, let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 3, 4, and 7
- Agent 1: Allocate items 6, 0, and 1
- Agent 2: Allocate items 2, 5, and 8

This allocation provides each agent with 3 items and balances the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 7],
    "1": [6, 0, 1],
    "2": [2, 5, 8]
}
```
