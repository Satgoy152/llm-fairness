Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  31  68  68  12  77  32  63  63
1  78  63  75  34  80  77  42  54  77
2  20  64   8  46  28  49  19  82  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that prioritizes the highest value each agent has for each unallocated item until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest unallocated item value for each agent.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest value for that item.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 29
   - Agent 1 values it at 78 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 20
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 31
   - Agent 1 values it at 63 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 64 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 75 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 8
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 34
   - Agent 2 values it at 46
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 12
   - Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - Allocate to Agent 1

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 77 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 77 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 49
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (break tie arbitrarily)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 42 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Allocate to Agent 1

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 54
   - Agent 2 values it at 82 (highest)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

9. **Item 8**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 77 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Allocate to Agent 1

The final allocation is:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8],
    "2": [1, 7]
}
```
