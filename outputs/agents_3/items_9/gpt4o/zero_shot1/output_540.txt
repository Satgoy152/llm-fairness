Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  36  66   5  73  52  93  61  78
1  12  61  10  95  64  44   5  51  45
2  59  94  65  91  44  81  55  85  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 36 66  5 73 52 93 61 78]

 [59 94 65 91 44 81 55 85 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items distributed. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items: 0, 6, 8
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items: 3, 1, 4
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items: 1, 3, 7

We can use a strategy to allocate the items by considering these high valuations and ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 6, 8 (valuations: 97, 93, 78)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4 (valuations: 95, 64)
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, 5, 7 (valuations: 94, 65, 81, 85)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of items distributed equals 9.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
