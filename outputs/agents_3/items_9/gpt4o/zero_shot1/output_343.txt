Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  31  95  77  75  48   1  70  24
1   8  80  40  22  91  76  38  13  16
2  84  73  70  38  40  46   5  52   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. Let's consider the valuations and make allocations accordingly.

**Step 1: Initial Analysis of Valuations**

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 2, 0, and 3.
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 4, 1, and 5.
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 0, 1, and 2.

**Step 2: Allocations**

- Assign items based on the highest valuations, giving priority to agents who value them the most:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 (95)
   - Item 0 (90)
   - Item 3 (77)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 4 (91)
   - Item 1 (80)
   - Item 5 (76)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 6 (5)
   - Item 7 (52)
   - Item 8 (0)

**Step 3: Verification**

- Ensure each agent has 3 items.
- Ensure all 9 items are allocated.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [4, 1, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, maximizing their total valuations as much as possible given the constraints.
