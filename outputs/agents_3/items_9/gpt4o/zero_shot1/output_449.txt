Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  10   5  89  45  23  29  16  49
1  78   4  57  17  60  90  80  93  60
2  92  29   4  17  96  45  55   7   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items with a total of 9 items allocated.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate them in a way that balances the overall value:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [12, 10, 5, 89, 45, 23, 29, 16, 49]
   - Highest values: 89 (item 3), 49 (item 8)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [78, 4, 57, 17, 60, 90, 80, 93, 60]
   - Highest values: 93 (item 7), 90 (item 5), 80 (item 6)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [92, 29, 4, 17, 96, 45, 55, 7, 8]
   - Highest values: 96 (item 4), 92 (item 0)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 3 and item 8 to Agent 0, as they provide significant value.
- Assign item 7, item 5, and item 6 to Agent 1, as they have the highest values for Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 and item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest values for Agent 2.

Remaining items are 1 and 2. Let's allocate them based on the next highest values:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value 29).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value 57).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 7, 2],
    "2": [4, 0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with all 9 items allocated.
