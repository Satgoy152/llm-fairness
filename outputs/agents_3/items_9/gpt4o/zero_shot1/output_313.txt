Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  65  39  36  20  27  62  92  93
1  96  53  19  39  50  28  24   6  47
2  51   7  90  32  24  76  94  39   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the number of items allocated to each is balanced or as fair as possible. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of one way to achieve this:

1. **List each agent's preferences for items** by their value in descending order.

2. **Allocate items** one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that we do not allocate more items to one agent if another agent has fewer items.

3. **Check the balance** of allocations to ensure fairness, and adjust if necessary.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's top values**: 93 (item 8), 92 (item 7), 87 (item 0)
2. **Agent 1's top values**: 96 (item 0), 53 (item 1), 50 (item 4)
3. **Agent 2's top values**: 94 (item 6), 90 (item 2), 76 (item 5)

Proposed allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [7, 8] (highest values they have that are not highest for others)
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 4] (highest values they have that are not highest for others)
- Agent 2 gets items [2, 5, 6] (highest values they have that are not highest for others)

Remaining items (1, 3) are assigned to balance the number of items:
- Agent 0 gets item 3
- Agent 1 gets item 1

Now, each agent has approximately an equal number of items:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [7, 8, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 4, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 5, 6]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 1],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
