Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  73  98   4  69  44  32   8  28
1  44  10  83  97  33  29  97  60   9
2  60  86  22  21  38  97  51  85  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the agents' total valuations for the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they get their most valued items.
2. Distribute items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's walk through the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 2, 0, and 1.
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 3, 6, and 2.
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 5, 7, and 1.

Considering these preferences, one possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 8 (valuations: 89, 98, 28).
- Agent 1 receives items 3, 6, 7 (valuations: 97, 97, 60).
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 4, 5 (valuations: 86, 38, 97).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a balanced total valuation and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
