Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  56   2  62  32   3  21  89  98
1   2   6  44  28  29  23  26  99  53
2  80  35  73  37  86  20   0  97  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. This requires balancing the allocations such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's analyze the given valuations to arrive at a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: Items 0 (87), 7 (89), and 8 (98).
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**: Items 7 (99), 2 (44), and 8 (53).
3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**: Items 4 (86), 0 (80), and 7 (97).

Now, let's fairly distribute the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 8 (98) - highest preference among all agents.
  - Item 0 (87) - second highest preference, available for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 7 (99) - highest preference among all agents.
  - Item 2 (44) - second highest preference for Agent 1.
  - Item 3 (28) - not strongly preferred by others, reasonable allocation.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 4 (86) - highest preference by Agent 2.
  - Item 1 (35) - a compromise given other allocations.
  - Item 5 (20) - ensures Agent 2 receives three items.
  - Item 6 (0) - least valued but necessary for complete allocation.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a selection of high-value items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [7, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 1, 5, 6]
}
```
