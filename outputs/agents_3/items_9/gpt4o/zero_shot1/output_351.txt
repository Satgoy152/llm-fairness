Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  91  20  39  36  56   6  53  65
1  51  85  42   6  74  65  25  12  13
2  83  26  42  59  59  12  24  36  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while considering their valuations. We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - High valuations: 91 (item 1), 65 (item 8), 56 (item 5)
   
2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - High valuations: 85 (item 1), 74 (item 4), 65 (item 5)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - High valuations: 83 (item 0), 59 (item 3 and 4)

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Assign items with the highest valuation to agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

**Step-by-step Allocation**:
1. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 at 85, and Agent 2 at 26.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 65, and Agent 2 at 12.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 at 13, and Agent 2 at 15.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 51, and Agent 2 at 83.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 74, and Agent 2 at 59.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 6, and Agent 2 at 59.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

7. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 42, and Agent 2 at 42.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

8. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 25, and Agent 2 at 24.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

9. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 12, and Agent 2 at 36.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 8, 7],
    "1": [5, 4, 2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair number of items while considering their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
