Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  58   8  50  15   8  48  48  69
1  57  32  82  22  67  67  27  63  45
2  48   7   1  72  23  66  66  17  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a reasonable value distribution based on their preferences. This is not necessarily optimizing for the highest total valuation but aims for a balanced allocation.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. Determine which items are of highest value to each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (69), Item 1 (58), Item 3 (50)
   - Allocate items: 8, 1, 3

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (82), Item 4 (67), Item 5 (67)
   - Allocate items: 2, 4, 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 8 (88), Item 3 (72), Item 5 (66)
   - Allocate items: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's check the allocations and ensure each item is allocated only once:

- Agent 0 has items 8, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has items 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 has items 0, 6, and 7.

This allocation distributes the items among the agents with attention to their highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 7]
}
```
