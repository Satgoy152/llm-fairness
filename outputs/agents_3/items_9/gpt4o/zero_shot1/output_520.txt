Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  60  34  20  87  75  70  41  60
1  43  21  38  45  39  28  29  79  48
2  13   2  96  23  90  88  85   3   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's look at the valuations and make a fair distribution.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (87), Item 5 (75), Item 0 (67), Item 6 (70)
   - Allocate highest value items to Agent 0 to maximize fairness.
   - Allocate: Item 4, Item 0, and Item 6 (Total value: 224)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (79), Item 3 (45), Item 2 (38)
   - Allocate high-value items for Agent 1 to ensure a fair share.
   - Allocate: Item 7, Item 3, and Item 2 (Total value: 162)

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 5 (88), Item 1 (2)
   - Allocate the remaining items while considering valuation.
   - Allocate: Item 5, Item 1, and Item 8 (Total value: 96)

### Final Allocation in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 6],
    "1": [7, 3, 2],
    "2": [5, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the three agents, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.
