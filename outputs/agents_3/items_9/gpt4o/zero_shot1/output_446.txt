Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  57  81   8  20  98  79  33  30
1  26  85  18  73   9  59  62  91  90
2  59  24  64  87   7  64  21  56  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to balance both the total value each agent receives and the number of items each agent gets. One common approach is to maximize the sum of the values for each agent while ensuring each agent gets about the same number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get if they were assigned the items that maximize their personal valuation.
2. Allocate each agent an approximately equal number of items, trying to maximize each agentâ€™s total value.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 1, 3, and 7.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 3, 8, and 5.

We should ensure that each agent gets 3 items since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

### Possible Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 3 items. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives while ensuring each gets an equal number of items.
