Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11   8  78  96  66  52  54  69   3
1  56  88  91  96  34  63  44  45  19
2  29  67  52  77  65   4  76  98  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets approximately the same number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and find an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (96), Item 2 (78), Item 4 (66)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (96), Item 2 (91), Item 1 (88)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (98), Item 8 (90), Item 6 (76)
   
Given the overlaps in high valuations, let's try to distribute items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0** can take Items [3, 2, 4] to maximize his satisfaction.
- **Agent 1** can take Items [1, 0, 5], avoiding conflict on Item 3 while still receiving high-valued items.
- **Agent 2** will get Items [7, 8, 6] with the highest valuations for these items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and their valuations are optimized based on available items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
