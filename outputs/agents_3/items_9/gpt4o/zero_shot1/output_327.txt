Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  45   7  44  39  35   5  35  95
1  45  81  55  69  15  60  56  53  70
2  48  52  97  63  29  34  54  57  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to achieving this is to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation, ensuring a fair distribution of total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (95), Item 1 (45), Item 3 (44)
   - Allocating items 8, 1, and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations among remaining items: Item 1 (81), Item 3 (69), Item 8 (70), Item 0 (45)
   - Since Item 1, 3, and 8 are already taken, allocate items 0, 5, and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations among remaining items: Item 2 (97), Item 3 (63), Item 6 (54)
   - Items 2, 4, and 6 are allocated to Agent 2.

Now let's check:
- Agent 0: 3 items
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 3 items
- Total: 9 items allocated

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
