Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  77  37  46  76  14  31  21  62
1  11  38  71  66  41  94  92   3  40
2  98  27  95  46  73  46  50  76  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonably fair portion of the items. We need to allocate all 9 items among the 3 agents, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's look at the highest valuations for each agent and try to assign items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (77), Item 4 (76), Item 8 (62)
   - Allocation: Items 1, 4, 8

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (94), Item 6 (92), Item 2 (71)
   - Allocation: Items 5, 6, 2

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 2 (95), Item 7 (76)
   - Note: Item 2 is already taken by Agent 1
   - Allocation: Items 0, 7, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences and valuations. Each agent receives exactly 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 2],
    "2": [0, 7, 3]
}
```
