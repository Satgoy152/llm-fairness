Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  22  16  59  15  58  36  45  75
1  80  50  58  98  78   0  83  37  81
2  39  21  27  83  94  11  68  77  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 22 16 59 15 58 36 45 75]
 [80 50 58 98 78  0 83 37 81]
 [39 21 27 83 94 11 68 77 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least a few items. A common approach is to use a "round-robin" or "highest bid" method, where each agent chooses their most valued item in turns, or we find a balance between maximizing each agent's total valuation and equal distribution of items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 83
   - Item 6: Value 36
   - Item 8: Value 75

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 98
   - Item 1: Value 50
   - Item 4: Value 78

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value 27
   - Item 5: Value 11
   - Item 7: Value 77

Each agent gets 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
