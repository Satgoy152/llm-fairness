Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  63  17  54  93  26   5  48  69
1  29  16  44   4  55  78  20  57  26
2   0  63  58  13  18  77  78  64  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of value based on their preferences. Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents.

Let's consider a strategy where we allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring each gets a reasonable share:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (93), Item 0 (67), Item 8 (69)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (78), Item 7 (57), Item 4 (55)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (78), Item 5 (77), Item 1 (63)

We need to ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share. Since each agent should get an integer number of items, let's attempt a balanced allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 5, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, 6, 3

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items maximizing their individual valuation while distributing all 9 items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6, 3]
}
```
