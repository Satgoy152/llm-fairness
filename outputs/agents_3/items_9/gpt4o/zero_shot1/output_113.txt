Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  73  97  39  15  99  42  26  97
1  13  82  25  47   9  45   8  42  40
2  50   3  18  24  39  67  63  60  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers both the values the agents assign to the items and the need to distribute items evenly. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Maximize total value**: Prioritize giving each agent items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

2. **Ensure fairness in allocation**: Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's proceed with this allocation strategy:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 5 (99), Item 2 (97), Item 8 (97)
  - Allocate: Items 5, 2, 8.

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest values (excluding already allocated items): Item 1 (82), Item 3 (47), Item 7 (42)
  - Allocate: Items 1, 3, 7.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest values (excluding already allocated items): Item 6 (63), Item 5 (67), Item 0 (50) - note that item 5 is already allocated
  - Allocate: Items 0, 6, 4 (next highest remaining value).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [0, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and attempts to maximize the values each agent receives based on their preferences.
