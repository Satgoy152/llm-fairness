Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  50  86  82  90  41  17  88  13
1  47  72  33  85  60  78  68  74  59
2  46  71  69  55  88  98  77  15  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. Let's consider each agent's valuation and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with relatively high value according to their preferences.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (90), 7 (88), 3 (82)
   - Allocate items: 4, 7, 3

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (85), 5 (78), 1 (72)
   - Allocate items: 5, 1, 8 (since 3 is already taken by Agent 0)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (98), 6 (77), 4 (88)
   - Allocate items: 0, 2, 6 (since 4 and 5 are already taken)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 3],
    "1": [5, 1, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
