Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  72  62  18  76   0  59  10  39
1   6  81  31   7  68  29  53  68   8
2  68  60  31  41  97  15  56  40  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: 51 + 72 + 62 + 18 + 76 + 0 + 59 + 10 + 39 = 387
   - Agent 1: 6 + 81 + 31 + 7 + 68 + 29 + 53 + 68 + 8 = 351
   - Agent 2: 68 + 60 + 31 + 41 + 97 + 15 + 56 + 40 + 83 = 491

2. **Assign Items to Balance Valuations:**
   - We aim to distribute items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Start by assigning the highest-valued items to help balance the total valuation across agents.

4. **Proposed Allocation:**

   - Assign items to Agent 0:
     - Item 1 (value 72)
     - Item 4 (value 76)
     - Item 0 (value 51)
     
   - Assign items to Agent 1:
     - Item 7 (value 68)
     - Item 2 (value 31)
     - Item 5 (value 29)
     
   - Assign items to Agent 2:
     - Item 8 (value 83)
     - Item 6 (value 56)
     - Item 3 (value 41)

5. **Verification:**

   - Agent 0 Total: 72 + 76 + 51 = 199
   - Agent 1 Total: 68 + 31 + 29 = 128
   - Agent 2 Total: 83 + 56 + 41 = 180

6. **JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 0],
    "1": [7, 2, 5],
    "2": [8, 6, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, given the constraint that each agent gets a specific number of items.
