Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  29  81  13  82  13   9  71  18
1  57   1  60   9  55  66  89  54  26
2  51  74  44  70  41   2  88  83   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 74 44 70 41  2 88 83  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by assigning items in a way that reflects their preferences. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, 4, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the most, followed by item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 7.

Using these observations, let's attempt to allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 91).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value: 74).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value: 81).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value: 70).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 82).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value: 66).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value: 89).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value: 83).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value: 26).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
