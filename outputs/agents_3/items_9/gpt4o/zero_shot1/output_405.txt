Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  18  68  35  33  67  90  61  85
1  50  73  54  91  92  29  15   2  77
2  86   2  69  77  82  13  39  76  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's analyze the valuations and aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

One approach is to give each agent a mix of high and low-value items according to their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives exactly 3 items, as there are 9 items and 3 agents. Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items with higher valuations from their perspective.
- Agent 1 receives items where they have relatively high value compared to others.
- Agent 2 receives items where they have high value or where others have less interest.

**Allocations:**
- Agent 0: Items 0, 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 7, 5

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 1],
    "2": [2, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and it attempts to balance the distribution based on their valuations.
