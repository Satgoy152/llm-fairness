Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4  5   6   7   8
0  23   1  15  87   5  7  77  33  58
1  12  79  11  36  19  9   8  95   3
2  33  77  21  80  48  6  22  65  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach. One possible method is to allocate items based on each agent's preferences, ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by giving Agent 0 some of the items they value highly.
   - Items: 3 (value 87), 6 (value 77), and 8 (value 58)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Items: 1 (value 79), 7 (value 95), and 4 (value 19)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items based on Agent 2's preferences.
   - Items: 0 (value 33), 2 (value 21), and 5 (value 6)

This allocation gives each agent an approximately equal number of items and considers their preferences. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 7, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
