Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65   1  75  48  34  59  19  76  36
1  45  28  85   3  36  58  53  76   8
2  93  51  52  71  13  75  56  62  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 51 52 71 13 75 56 62 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuation of the items. Let's consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation of 93.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation of 1.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation of 85.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation of 71.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation of 34.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation of 75.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation of 53.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation of 76.
9. Assign item 8 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation of 59.

This allocation fairly distributes the items based on the valuations of the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their preferences.
