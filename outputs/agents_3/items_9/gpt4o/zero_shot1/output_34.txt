Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  13  59  55  77  52  32  93  32
1  31  38  40  12  14  15  12  73  15
2  64  41  91  88  61   7  30  21  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 13 59 55 77 52 32 93 32]
 [31 38 40 12 14 15 12 73 15]
 [64 41 91 88 61  7 30 21 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Item 7 (93), Item 2 (59), Item 3 (55)
   - Allocate items: 7, 2, 3

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (38), Item 0 (31)
   - Allocate items: 1, 0

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Item 8 (96), Item 6 (30), Item 4 (61), Item 5 (7)
   - Allocate items: 8, 6, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of items is 9. The goal is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while distributing all items.

Here are the allocations presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [8, 6, 4, 5]
}
```
