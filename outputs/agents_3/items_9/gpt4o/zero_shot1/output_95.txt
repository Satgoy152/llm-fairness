Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  81  39  73   9  75  73  27  11
1  35  54  94  56  48   8  86  32  71
2  68   8  35  15  94  36  87  92  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with highest value for this agent.
   - Item 5 (Value 75)
   - Item 0 (Value 71)
   - Item 3 (Value 73)

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with highest value for this agent.
   - Item 2 (Value 94)
   - Item 8 (Value 71)
   - Item 6 (Value 86)

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with highest value for this agent.
   - Item 4 (Value 94)
   - Item 7 (Value 92)
   - Item 1 (Value 8)

This results in each agent receiving three items, and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

These allocations aim to fairly distribute the items while considering the valuations provided for each item by the agents.
