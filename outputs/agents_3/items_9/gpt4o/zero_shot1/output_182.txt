Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  61  66  72  42  34  37  10  29
1  94  66  34  74  88  28  33  23  28
2  32  60  88  79  19  38  71  49  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll consider each agent's preferences and attempt to balance the allocations to be as equitable as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items: 3 (72), 2 (66), 1 (61).
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items: 0 (94), 4 (88), 3 (74).
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items: 2 (88), 8 (86), 3 (79).

Now, let's make the allocations with the goal of fairness and maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate items 0 (38) and 1 (61), as these are among their higher valuations and are not in direct conflict with other agents' top preferences.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items 3 (74) and 4 (88), as these are among their highest preferences and not overlapping with Agent 0's allocation.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items 2 (88), 8 (86), and 6 (71), as these are among their highest preferences and not overlapping with the allocated items for Agents 0 and 1.

After this initial allocation, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Allocate item 5 (38) to Agent 0, as it adds value and doesn't conflict with their allocation.
- Allocate item 7 (49) to Agent 2, as it fits well with their already higher valued items and maintains balance.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, with no overlaps, and all items are distributed.
