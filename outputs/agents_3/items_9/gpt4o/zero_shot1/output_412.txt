Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  81   4  18  11  14  77  78  31
1  22  48  94   5  60   5  55  54  77
2  71  88  71  12  39  21  59  72  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items, considering their valuations. We'll aim for a balanced allocation that aims to maximize total value for each agent while distributing the items fairly.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: 88 (item 0), 81 (item 1), 78 (item 7)
   - We can allocate items 0, 1, and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: 94 (item 2), 77 (item 8), 60 (item 4)
   - We can allocate items 2, 4, and 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: 95 (item 8), 88 (item 1), 72 (item 7)
   - Since item 8 is already allocated to Agent 1, and item 1 and 7 to Agent 0, we look at available items: 71 (item 2), 71 (item 0), 59 (item 6)
   - Allocate items 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 2.

Thus, each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.
