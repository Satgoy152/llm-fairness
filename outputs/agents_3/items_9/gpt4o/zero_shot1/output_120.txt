Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  27  99  27  96  71  10  32  74
1  51  40   9  34  13  98  99  42  69
2   2  55  57  48  77  38   6  37  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We'll aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Items with their Valuations per Agent:**

    - **Agent 0:** 21, 27, 99, 27, 96, 71, 10, 32, 74
    - **Agent 1:** 51, 40, 9, 34, 13, 98, 99, 42, 69
    - **Agent 2:** 2, 55, 57, 48, 77, 38, 6, 37, 11

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness:**

    - Given the valuations, we will try to equally distribute the overall value each agent receives.
    - We can use a greedy method to assign items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

3. **Proposed Allocation:**

    - **Agent 0:**
        - Items: 2 (Value: 99), 4 (Value: 96), 0 (Value: 21)
    - **Agent 1:**
        - Items: 6 (Value: 99), 5 (Value: 98), 1 (Value: 40)
    - **Agent 2:**
        - Items: 3 (Value: 48), 7 (Value: 37), 8 (Value: 11)

4. **Verification of Allocation:**

    - **Agent 0 Total Value:** 99 + 96 + 21 = 216
    - **Agent 1 Total Value:** 99 + 98 + 40 = 237
    - **Agent 2 Total Value:** 48 + 37 + 11 = 96

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items, maximizing their individual valuations. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 0],
    "1": [6, 5, 1],
    "2": [3, 7, 8]
}
```
