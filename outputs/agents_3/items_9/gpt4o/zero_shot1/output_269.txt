Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  23  26  77  35  29  93  77  93
1  30  15  99   5  11  20  87  36  28
2  20  77  43  94  20  70  18  66  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can look for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. The goal is to balance the total value each agent receives to achieve fairness.

Let's go through the agents and allocate the items based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 6, 8, and 3 with values 93, 93, and 77, respectively.
   - Allocate items 6 and 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 2, 6, and 0 with values 99, 87, and 30, respectively.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations are for items 3, 1, and 5 with values 94, 77, and 70, respectively.
   - Allocate items 3 and 1 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the remaining items and allocate fairly:

4. **Unallocated Items:** 
   - Items 0, 4, 5, and 7 remain unallocated.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, item 4 to Agent 1, and items 0 and 7 to Agent 2.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 1, 0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives items, and we try to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
