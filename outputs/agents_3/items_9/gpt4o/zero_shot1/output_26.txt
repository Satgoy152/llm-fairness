Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  42  83  98  13  25  48  31  76
1  60  42  30   5  45  11  29   9  66
2  24   9  65  29   2  48  20  82  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2), we need to consider their valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction. One approach is to use a method that ensures each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations provided and distribute the items to try to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 8 and 7.

We can start allocating items by choosing the ones with the highest value for each agent:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 98)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 60)
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 2 (value 90)

Now, consider the remaining items and allocate them to maximize value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 83)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 45)
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (value 82)

Three items remaining (1, 5, 6):

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 42)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 11)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 20)

This allocation ensures each agent gets three items, and the total number of items allocated is nine.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [8, 7, 6]
}
```
