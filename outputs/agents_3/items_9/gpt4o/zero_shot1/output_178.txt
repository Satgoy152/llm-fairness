Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  73  42  29  41  58  17  50  70
1  81  62  40  23  41   6   2  36  65
2  65  44  71  54  14  27  70   7  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuation: [57, 73, 42, 29, 41, 58, 17, 50, 70]
   - High valuations: Item 1 (73), Item 5 (58), Item 8 (70)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuation: [81, 62, 40, 23, 41, 6, 2, 36, 65]
   - High valuations: Item 0 (81), Item 1 (62), Item 8 (65)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuation: [65, 44, 71, 54, 14, 27, 70, 7, 86]
   - High valuations: Item 2 (71), Item 6 (70), Item 8 (86)

Let's try to allocate the items so that each agent gets some of their high-value items:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5, 7]
  - Total value: 73 (Item 1) + 58 (Item 5) + 50 (Item 7) = 181

- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3, 4]
  - Total value: 81 (Item 0) + 23 (Item 3) + 41 (Item 4) = 145

- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 6, 8]
  - Total value: 71 (Item 2) + 70 (Item 6) + 86 (Item 8) = 227

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high values according to their preferences, while also distributing the total items fairly.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6, 8]
}
```
