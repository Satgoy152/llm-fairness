Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  16  40  49  96  75  11  15  94
1  17  30  75  77  21  17  69  39  48
2  14  64   3  94  85  45  74  44  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
Allocating items to agents based on the given valuations, we aim to fairly distribute the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a potential allocation that considers the valuations and tries to balance the overall value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 4 and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 3 and moderate valuations for other items.

Considering these and trying to balance the total value each agent receives, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [4, 8]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 3]
- Agent 2 receives items: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while taking into account their valuations.
