Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  89  27  76  90  67  17  63  46
1  49  13  36  70  91  91  63  72  57
2  89  38  20  97  66  56  26  46  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 38 20 97 66 56 26 46 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation by any agent for the remaining unallocated items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest valuation in the table for any item and allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. Remove the allocated item from consideration.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all items are allocated.

Let's perform this allocation:

- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 91)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (value 91)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (value 97)
- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 89)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 89)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (value 72)
- Item 8: Agent 2 (value 73)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 63)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value 27)

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 3 agents, with an attempt to maximize their individual valuations.
