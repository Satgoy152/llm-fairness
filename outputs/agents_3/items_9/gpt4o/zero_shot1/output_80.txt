Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  83  67  98  63  62  58  21   6
1  26  93  25  85  33  27  78  88  69
2  76  74  35  69  23  86   6   1  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share of total value across all items. A useful approach is to ensure that each agent gets at least a competitive share of the items based on their preferences.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

Agent 0:
- High valuations: 0 (98), 1 (83), 3 (98)

Agent 1:
- High valuations: 1 (93), 3 (85), 7 (88)

Agent 2:
- High valuations: 5 (86), 0 (76), 8 (72)

Now, let's try to allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring all 9 items are allocated:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 due to the highest valuation.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 due to the highest valuation.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as a secondary choice.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 due to the high valuation.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as a secondary choice.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 due to the highest valuation.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 as it has the highest relative value for them.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 as a secondary choice.
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 2 due to a high valuation.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value.
