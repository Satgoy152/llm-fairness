Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  57  89  16  11  22  24  11  46
1   0  47  59  19  69  60  86  10  50
2   2  99  59  62  42  76  47  89  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 99 59 62 42 76 47 89 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

3. **Balance the Allocation:**
   - If any agent ends up with no items, try to reallocate items from agents with more items to achieve a more balanced distribution.

### Allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (68)
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (99)
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (89)
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (62)
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (69)
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (76)
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (86)
- **Item 7:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (89)
- **Item 8:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (50)

### Initial Distribution:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 5, 7]

This initial allocation results in:
- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 4 items

### Final Balanced Allocation:
- The allocation is already balanced with each agent having at least some items and the total number of items (9) being distributed.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 6, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and the total allocation sums up to 9 items.
