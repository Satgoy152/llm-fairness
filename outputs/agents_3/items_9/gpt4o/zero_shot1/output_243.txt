Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40   3  12  67  83  90  72  22  21
1  16  23  73  68  42   9  46   5  55
2  54  41  15  69  62  41  17  12  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences:**
   - Agent 0's preferences (in descending order of value): 5, 4, 3, 6, 0, 7, 8, 2, 1
   - Agent 1's preferences: 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 1, 0, 7, 5
   - Agent 2's preferences: 8, 3, 4, 0, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7

2. **Allocate Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Ensure each agent gets an equal number of items, or as close as possible, given there are 9 items and 3 agents.

3. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Assign items based on each agentâ€™s highest preference that hasn't been allocated yet, ensuring each agent gets 3 items.

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Highest preferences are items 5, 4, and 3.
- **Agent 1:** Highest remaining preferences are items 2, 8, and 6.
- **Agent 2:** Highest remaining preferences are items 0, 1, and 7.

Given these considerations, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an equal number of items while considering their preferences.
