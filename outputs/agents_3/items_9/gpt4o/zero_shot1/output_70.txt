Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  52  54  84   2  44  41  26  60
1  53   9  36  12  19  81  88  79   5
2  18  93  13  49  49  87  50  83  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (84), 8 (60), 2 (54)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (88), 5 (81), 7 (79)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (93), 5 (87), 7 (83)

To ensure fairness, we'll attempt to allocate the highest valued items to each agent while maintaining a balance. 

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0** should receive items that maximize their valuation without conflicting with other agents' high preferences. 
  - Allocate items: [3, 8]

- **Agent 1** has a strong preference for items 6, 5, and 7.
  - Allocate items: [6, 5, 7]

- **Agent 2** has high valuations on items 1, 5, and 7; however, items 5 and 7 are already allocated to Agent 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
  - Allocate items: [1]

Remaining items to be allocated are: 0, 2, and 4.

- **Assign remaining items**:
  - Agent 0 can take item 2 (54), which is one of their high-valued items.
  - Agent 2 can take item 0 (18) and item 4 (49) as they still have capacity and these items are of relatively lower value to other agents.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 8, 2],
    "1": [6, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items considering each agent's preferences and ensures all items are allocated.
