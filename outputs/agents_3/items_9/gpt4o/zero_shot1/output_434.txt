Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  44  37  99  71  12  47  92  97
1  39  93  16   5   7  18  79  96   5
2  26   4  34  44  59   2   6  70  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 7, and 8. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 6, and 7. Since item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0, we will allocate items 1 and 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has relatively higher valuations for items 0, 4, and 2. We will allocate these items to Agent 2.

Allocating the remaining items:

- Item 5 is valued low by all agents, but Agent 1 has the highest valuation among them. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 0 as they have a higher valuation for it than Agent 1.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 7, 8, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 4

This allocation balances the number of items each agent receives and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8, 2],
    "1": [1, 6, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
