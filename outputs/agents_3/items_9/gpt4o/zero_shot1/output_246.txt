Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  54  99  18  51  90  16  84  83
1  20  34  83  61  85  32  68  18  62
2  38  80   9  27  40  34  22  67  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents given their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring an approximately equitable distribution of total values. We can use a simple heuristic to balance the allocations:

1. **Step 1:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Step 2:** Check the distribution of items and adjust if any agent has too many or too few items to ensure each agent gets a roughly equal share.

Let's apply this approach to the given valuations:

### Item Valuations:
- **Item 0:** Agent 0 (58), Agent 1 (20), Agent 2 (38)
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 (54), Agent 1 (34), Agent 2 (80)
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 (99), Agent 1 (83), Agent 2 (9)
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 (18), Agent 1 (61), Agent 2 (27)
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 (51), Agent 1 (85), Agent 2 (40)
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 (90), Agent 1 (32), Agent 2 (34)
- **Item 6:** Agent 0 (16), Agent 1 (68), Agent 2 (22)
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 (84), Agent 1 (18), Agent 2 (67)
- **Item 8:** Agent 0 (83), Agent 1 (62), Agent 2 (99)

### Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Value:
- **Item 0:** Agent 0
- **Item 1:** Agent 2
- **Item 2:** Agent 0
- **Item 3:** Agent 1
- **Item 4:** Agent 1
- **Item 5:** Agent 0
- **Item 6:** Agent 1
- **Item 7:** Agent 0
- **Item 8:** Agent 2

### Balancing the Allocation:
- Currently, Agent 0 has 4 items, Agent 1 has 3 items, and Agent 2 has 2 items.
- We need to move one item from Agent 0 to Agent 2 to balance the allocation.

After reviewing the items, we can make the following adjustments:
- **Move Item 7** from Agent 0 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 7, 8]

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while keeping the distribution as fair as possible based on the valuation table. Each agent receives three items, thereby maintaining balance.
