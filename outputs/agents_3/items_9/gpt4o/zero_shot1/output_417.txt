Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  30  85  39   8  51  37  73  96
1  59  15  74  27  60  36  19  30  80
2  94   7  17  57  16   9  22  92   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 30 85 39  8 51 37 73 96]

 [94  7 17 57 16  9 22 92  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a valuation-based approach where each agent attempts to maximize their total valuation of the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (96), Item 0 (89), Item 2 (85)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (80), Item 4 (60), Item 0 (59)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 7 (92), Item 3 (57)

Now let's allocate the items step by step to maximize fairness:

- **Step 1**: Allocate Item 8 to Agent 0 because they value it the most and it is the highest single value.
- **Step 2**: Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- **Step 3**: Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- **Step 4**: Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued item.
- **Step 5**: Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest valued item.
- **Step 6**: Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1, as it is their highest remaining valued item.
- **Step 7**: Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued item.
- **Step 8**: Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their next highest valued item.
- **Step 9**: Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued item.

Now, based on this allocation strategy, the JSON format for the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 7, 3]
}
```
