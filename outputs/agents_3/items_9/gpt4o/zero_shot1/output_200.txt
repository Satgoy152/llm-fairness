Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  97  16  34  20  32  97  17  37
1  16  67  54  50  77  12  40  60  94
2  76  36  31   5  19  43  96   7  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately equal share of their total valuation across all items.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 6 (97), Item 0 (84)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (94), Item 4 (77), Item 1 (67)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (96), Item 0 (76), Item 5 (43)

Now, let's allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (97) and it matches their highest preference.
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2, as they value it highly (96).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it's their next highest preference (84).
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 1, as it's their highest preference (94).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1, as it's their next highest preference (77).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2, as it's their next highest preference (43).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1, as it fits their next preference (60).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as they have space and it fits their next preference (16).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as they have space and it fits their next preference (5).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 2],
    "1": [8, 4, 7],
    "2": [6, 5, 3]
}
```
