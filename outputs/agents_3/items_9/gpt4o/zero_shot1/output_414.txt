Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  40  47  31  12   2  28  22  52
1  44  71  10  44  12   0   6  52  33
2  55  50  38  49  44  13  73   1  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1, but since Agent 0 already has a high valuation for item 1, we can focus on other items where Agent 1 has high valuations.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 6 and 2, and a decent valuation for item 0.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign items to each agent based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 7, 8]
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable amount of value, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
