Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  28  69  90  63  66  95  58  90
1  80  79  53  93  25  93  60  82  53
2  71  41  21  90  53  70  28  84  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 41 21 90 53 70 28 84 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Determine the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Assign each agent their highest valued items, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: 15, 28, 69, 90, 63, 66, 95, 58, 90
Agent 1: 80, 79, 53, 93, 25, 93, 60, 82, 53
Agent 2: 71, 41, 21, 90, 53, 70, 28, 84, 84
```

A reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items that Agent 0 values highly and are not the highest value for other agents where possible. For instance, item 6 (95), item 3 (90), item 2 (69), and item 4 (63).

- Agent 1: Items that Agent 1 values highly and are not the highest value for other agents. For instance, item 1 (79), item 5 (93), item 0 (80).

- Agent 2: Items that Agent 2 values highly and are not the highest value for other agents. For instance, item 7 (84), item 8 (84).

Here's the allocation based on the strategy described:

```
{
    "0": [3, 6, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
