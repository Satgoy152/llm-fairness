Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  39  85  97  75  77  53  78  49
1  67  80  88  72  30  51  28  17  44
2  13  25  66  23  14  39  34  50  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 25 66 23 14 39 34 50 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0: 
- Highest valuations: Items 3 (97), 2 (85), 0 (79), 7 (78)

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Items 2 (88), 1 (80), 0 (67), 3 (72)

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Items 2 (66), 7 (50), 5 (39), 6 (34)

Considering the above, we can try to distribute the items to maximize satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2, so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 0, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 1, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 2 has a relatively higher valuation for item 7 compared to other agents, so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 5, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 4, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
8. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 6, so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
9. Agent 2 has a higher valuation for item 8, so assign item 8 to Agent 2.

By following this allocation, we ensure that all items are divided among the agents, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
