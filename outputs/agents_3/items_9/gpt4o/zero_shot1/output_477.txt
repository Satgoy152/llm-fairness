Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  89  37  42  27  48  17  36  50
1  51  67  57  34  80  71  42  78  65
2  46  82  69  49  82  44  56  74  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **List of Items and Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [45, 89, 37, 42, 27, 48, 17, 36, 50]
   - Agent 1: [51, 67, 57, 34, 80, 71, 42, 78, 65]
   - Agent 2: [46, 82, 69, 49, 82, 44, 56, 74, 32]

2. **Initial Considerations:**
   - Each agent should ideally receive 3 items, since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

3. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - We should attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Calculate the highest value each agent places on an item and prioritize allocation based on these values.

5. **Allocation Steps:**
   - Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives exactly 3 items.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 8: (45 + 89 + 50 = 184)
   - Agent 1 receives items 4, 5, and 7: (80 + 71 + 78 = 229)
   - Agent 2 receives items 2, 3, and 6: (69 + 49 + 56 = 174)

7. **Verify Total Items Allocated:**
   - Total items: 9 (3 items per agent)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
