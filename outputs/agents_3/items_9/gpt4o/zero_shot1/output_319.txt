Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  87  50  90  34  15  34  62  57
1  33  45  45  41  34  17  13  17  77
2  23  20  50  33  92  95  48  13  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the total value each agent gets and the number of items each agent receives. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, a simple allocation strategy is to ensure each agent gets 3 items. However, the actual decision should ideally maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation:

### Step 1: Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent
- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (value 90).
- Agent 1 values item 8 the highest (value 77).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (value 95).

### Step 2: Allocate Initial High-Value Items
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

### Step 3: Allocate Remaining Items
- Calculate remaining items and consider the next highest values for each agent.

#### Agent 0
- Item 1 (value 87)
- Item 2 (value 50)
  
#### Agent 1
- Item 0 (value 33)
- Item 2 (value 45)

#### Agent 2
- Item 4 (value 92)
- Item 6 (value 48)

### Step 4: Final Allocation
Ensure each agent gets exactly 3 items.

- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 8, 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 5, 4, 6

After considering the values and allocations, here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 2],
    "1": [8, 0, 7],
    "2": [5, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items and aims to maximize their perceived value.
