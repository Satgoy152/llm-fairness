Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  65  52  20   7  97   6  21  32
1  17  43  21  11  76  87  41  83  79
2  76  41  77  29   3  44  89  57  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a simple greedy allocation, where we assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty allocation for each agent.

2. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the valuations for each agent.
   - Agent 0: 6 + 65 + 52 + 20 + 7 + 97 + 6 + 21 + 32 = 306
   - Agent 1: 17 + 43 + 21 + 11 + 76 + 87 + 41 + 83 + 79 = 458
   - Agent 2: 76 + 41 + 77 + 29 + 3 + 44 + 89 + 57 + 71 = 487

3. **Allocate Items**: Distribute items to agents one by one, prioritizing their highest valuations.

4. **Ensure Fairness**: Each agent should ideally receive 3 items (since there are 9 items and 3 agents). If imbalance occurs, adjust by swapping items to ensure each agent has 3 items.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items with highest valuations: 5 (97), 1 (65), 2 (52)
- Agent 1 gets items with highest valuations: 8 (79), 7 (83), 4 (76)
- Agent 2 gets items with highest valuations: 0 (76), 6 (89), 3 (29)

After allocating the items, we ensure that each agent has 3 items.

Now, here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 2],
    "1": [8, 7, 4],
    "2": [0, 6, 3]
}
```
