Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  53  16  21  40  13  64  83  33
1  87  92  94  63  81  37  63  51   2
2  36  48  69  99  83  70  96  20  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item, and look for the highest valued items for each agent.

2. Ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5.

Allocate the remaining items such that each agent has an equal number of items, or as close to equal as possible.

Given these considerations, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [6, 7, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 8]
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 0],
    "1": [1, 2, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
