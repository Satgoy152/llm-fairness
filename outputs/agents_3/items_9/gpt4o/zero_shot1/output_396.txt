Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  47  57   3  76  49  69  86  94
1  96  88  58  58  45  30  68  58  53
2  94  55  45  57  24  21  72  89   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while distributing items as evenly as possible. Hereâ€™s how the allocation can be done:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each item across agents:** 
   - Item 0: 58 (Agent 0) + 96 (Agent 1) + 94 (Agent 2) = 248
   - Item 1: 47 (Agent 0) + 88 (Agent 1) + 55 (Agent 2) = 190
   - Item 2: 57 (Agent 0) + 58 (Agent 1) + 45 (Agent 2) = 160
   - Item 3: 3 (Agent 0) + 58 (Agent 1) + 57 (Agent 2) = 118
   - Item 4: 76 (Agent 0) + 45 (Agent 1) + 24 (Agent 2) = 145
   - Item 5: 49 (Agent 0) + 30 (Agent 1) + 21 (Agent 2) = 100
   - Item 6: 69 (Agent 0) + 68 (Agent 1) + 72 (Agent 2) = 209
   - Item 7: 86 (Agent 0) + 58 (Agent 1) + 89 (Agent 2) = 233
   - Item 8: 94 (Agent 0) + 53 (Agent 1) + 6 (Agent 2) = 153

2. **Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Items with highest valuations are 0 (58), 4 (76), and 8 (94).
   - Agent 1: Items with highest valuations are 0 (96), 1 (88), and 3 (58).
   - Agent 2: Items with highest valuations are 0 (94), 6 (72), and 7 (89).

3. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:**
   - Assign items to agents while ensuring each agent gets as close to an equal share as possible.

   - **Final Allocation:**
     - Agent 0: Items 4, 8
     - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3
     - Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 6, 7

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while attempting to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
