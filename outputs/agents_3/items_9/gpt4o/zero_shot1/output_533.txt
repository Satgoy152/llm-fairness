Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  44  78  92  96  60  77  48  20
1  70  56  55  87  50  64  89  43  92
2  38  79  43  19  75  59  85  98  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent gets a reasonably balanced value in terms of their preferences. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Distribute the items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets approximately an equal number of items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items and then allocate:

- Agent 0: 14 + 44 + 78 + 92 + 96 + 60 + 77 + 48 + 20 = 529
- Agent 1: 70 + 56 + 55 + 87 + 50 + 64 + 89 + 43 + 92 = 606
- Agent 2: 38 + 79 + 43 + 19 + 75 + 59 + 85 + 98 + 63 = 559

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 4, 0 (highest values: 92, 96, 14)
- Agent 1 receives items: 8, 6, 5 (highest values: 92, 89, 64)
- Agent 2 receives items: 7, 1, 2 (highest values: 98, 79, 43)

This allocation gives each agent three items and aims to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 0],
    "1": [8, 6, 5],
    "2": [7, 1, 2]
}
```
