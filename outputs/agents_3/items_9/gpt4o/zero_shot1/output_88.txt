Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  24  33  56  21   4  86  15  47
1  15  48   0  66  23   1  70  50  78
2  75  29  25  97  91  45  34  67  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. To achieve this, we can use a simple greedy approach, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items and allocate them accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 15, and Agent 2 values it at 75. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 48, and Agent 2 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 0, and Agent 2 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 66, and Agent 2 values it at 97. Allocate to Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 23, and Agent 2 values it at 91. Allocate to Agent 2.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 1, and Agent 2 values it at 45. Allocate to Agent 2.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 70, and Agent 2 values it at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 50, and Agent 2 values it at 67. Allocate to Agent 2.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 78, and Agent 2 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.

After allocating the items, we have the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4, 5, 7]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
