Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17   1  28  47  49  77   1  63  38
1  60   8  36  11  40  17  33  84  64
2   6  18  89  19  39  23   5  34  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the value each agent places on the items and try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an equitable share of the items.

Here are the steps for allocating the items:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Check for items that have very high valuations from particular agents and prioritize these allocations to maximize total satisfaction.

2. **Balance Allocations:** Ensure that each agent gets a reasonable number of items, which means each agent should get about three items to ensure fairness since there are nine items and three agents.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:** Adjust allocations to balance between maximizing individual agent satisfaction and ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations on items: 5 (77), 7 (63), 3 (47).
- **Agent 1** has high valuations on items: 7 (84), 8 (64), 0 (60).
- **Agent 2** has high valuations on items: 2 (89), 8 (86).

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 5 (value 77) to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 7 (value 84) to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 (value 89) to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 3 (value 47) to Agent 0.
5. Assign item 8 (value 64, Agent 1) or 86 (Agent 2). Since it has a higher value for Agent 2, let's give it to Agent 2.
6. Assign item 0 (value 60) to Agent 1.
7. Assign item 4 (value 39) to Agent 2.
8. Assign item 1 (value 1) to Agent 0.
9. Assign item 6 (value 33) to Agent 1.

Finally, we have each agent receiving 3 items, distributed based on a balance of high valuations and fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 1],
    "1": [7, 0, 6],
    "2": [2, 8, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and the allocation is balanced to reflect the highest possible satisfaction based on their valuations.
