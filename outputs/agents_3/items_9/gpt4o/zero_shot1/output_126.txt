Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  46  84  49  76  96  39  88  44
1  93  63  95  52  47  79   0  28  37
2  75  10  33  35  61  95  21  75   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 10 33 35 61 95 21 75  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value, while also ensuring that every item is allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuation for items 0, 2, 5, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high valuation for items 0, 2, 3, and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuation for items 0, 4, 5, and 7.

To balance these interests, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair portion of high-value items relative to their own preferences, while also distributing the items evenly:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0, 2, and 7. 
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 3, 4, and 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 5, 6, and 8.

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and all items are distributed. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 1],
    "2": [5, 6, 8]
}
```
