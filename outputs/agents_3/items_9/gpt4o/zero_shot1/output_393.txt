Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  85  18   5  84  89  29  52  10
1  95  68  73  46  93  21  14  25  97
2  64  52  30  95  48   6  79  63  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every agent gets an approximately equal number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. Let's allocate them based on maximizing individual valuations while keeping the allocation balanced.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the highest value items each agent can receive.
2. Ensure each agent receives 3 items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0's highest value items: 
  - Item 5 (value 89)
  - Item 4 (value 84)
  - Item 1 (value 85)

- Agent 1's highest value items:
  - Item 8 (value 97)
  - Item 0 (value 95)
  - Item 4 (value 93) [but already taken by Agent 0, so next highest]
  - Item 2 (value 73)

- Agent 2's highest value items:
  - Item 3 (value 95)
  - Item 8 (value 88) [but already taken by Agent 1, so next highest]
  - Item 6 (value 79)
  - Item 7 (value 63)

Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 4, 1
- Agent 1: Items 8, 0, 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 6, 7

In JSON format, this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 1],
    "1": [8, 0, 2],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and each item is allocated to only one agent.
