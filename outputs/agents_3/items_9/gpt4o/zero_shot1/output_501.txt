Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  16  74  32  20   8  24  72  81
1  81  94  31  13  61  25  89  16  13
2  26  18  30  36  31   4  78  65  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to ensure that the distribution is equitable. One common approach is to use a "max-min fairness" strategy, which aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 (87), item 8 (81), and item 2 (74) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (94), item 6 (89), and item 4 (61) highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 (78), item 7 (65), and item 8 (48) highly.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Distribute items to agents based on their highest values while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of total value.

3. **Adjust to Ensure Each Agent Gets an Integer Number of Items:**
   - Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, aim to allocate 3 items to each agent if possible.

Let's make the allocations with these considerations:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items that are high-value for Agent 0.
  - Item 0 (87), Item 2 (74), and Item 8 (81).

- **Agent 1:** Allocate items that are high-value for Agent 1.
  - Item 1 (94), Item 4 (61), and Item 3 (13).

- **Agent 2:** Allocate items that are high-value for Agent 2.
  - Item 6 (78), Item 7 (65), and Item 5 (4).

This allocation attempts to balance the total value across agents while ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 3],
    "2": [6, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 3 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
