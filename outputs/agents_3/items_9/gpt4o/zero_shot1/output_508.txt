Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  63  34   8  57  71  29  67  69
1  90  38  59  75  63  48  48   9  97
2  50  29  40  50  71  18  30  71  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (71)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (70)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 8 (69)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 8 (97)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (90)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 3 (75)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (71)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 7 (71)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 3 (50)

To create a fair allocation, we should try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign **Agent 0** items they value highly: Item 5, Item 1, and Item 2.
- Assign **Agent 1** items they value highly: Item 8, Item 0, and Item 3.
- Assign **Agent 2** items they value highly: Item 4, Item 6, and Item 7.

This way, each agent receives three items, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 2],
    "1": [8, 0, 3],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned while trying to give each agent some of their higher-valued items.
