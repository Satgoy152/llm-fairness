Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  78  33  34  16  23  95  84  89
1  35   8  56   6  57  30   4  34  60
2  71  33   0  22  76  85  90  80   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 78 33 34 16 23 95 84 89]
 [35  8 56  6 57 30  4 34 60]
 [71 33  0 22 76 85 90 80  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ideally ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total perceived value. Given that there are 3 agents and 9 items, each agent will receive 3 items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 95.
   - Next highest valued items for Agent 0 are item 8 at 89 and item 7 at 84.
   - Allocate items 6, 8, and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1's highest valued item is 4 at 57.
   - Next highest valued items for Agent 1 are item 2 at 56 and item 8 at 60. However, item 8 is already allocated to Agent 0. Let's consider the next available item, which is 0 at 35.
   - Allocate items 4, 2, and 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2's highest valued item is 5 at 85.
   - Next highest valued items for Agent 2 are item 6 at 90 and item 4 at 76. However, items 6 and 4 are already allocated. Let's consider the next available items, which are 3 at 22 and 1 at 33.
   - Allocate items 5, 3, and 1 to Agent 2.

So, the final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 7],
    "1": [4, 2, 0],
    "2": [5, 3, 1]
}
```
