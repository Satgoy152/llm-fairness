Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  25  89  80  76  20  64   6  35
1  41  14   7  59  59  92  45  96  18
2  64  30  77  27  59   9  97  96  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a roughly equal total value, considering each agent's respective valuations. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with higher values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Prioritize items with higher values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Prioritize items with higher values for Agent 2.

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 2 (Value: 89)
  - Item 3 (Value: 80)
  - Total value for Agent 0: 169

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 5 (Value: 92)
  - Item 7 (Value: 96)
  - Total value for Agent 1: 188

- **Agent 2:**
  - Item 0 (Value: 64)
  - Item 6 (Value: 97)
  - Item 8 (Value: 91)
  - Total value for Agent 2: 252

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 6, 8]
}
```
