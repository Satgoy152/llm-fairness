Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  46  79  59  11   7  28  12  45
1  88  48  20   4  15   5   1  17   6
2  22  60  15  24   4  59   4  80  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. The goal is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (79), 3 (59), 0 (30)
   - Allocate items: 2, 3, 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (88), 1 (48)
   - Allocate items: 0, 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 8 (91), 7 (80), 5 (59)
   - Allocate items: 8, 7, 5

To ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, let's adjust slightly to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 6
- Agent 2 receives items: 8, 7, 5, 4

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [8, 7, 5, 4]
}
```
