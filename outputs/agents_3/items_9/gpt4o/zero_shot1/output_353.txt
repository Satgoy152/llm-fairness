Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  29  81  53  74  77  97  83  87
1   1   8  78  52  23  99  17  93   2
2  68  96  95  77  46  12  80  74  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items based on their valuations while keeping the overall distribution balanced. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Verify if each agent has a reasonable and balanced number of items.
3. Adjust the allocations if necessary to ensure fairness.

Based on the table:

- For item 0, agent 2 values it the highest (68).
- For item 1, agent 2 values it the highest (96).
- For item 2, agent 0 values it the highest (81).
- For item 3, agent 2 values it the highest (77).
- For item 4, agent 0 values it the highest (74).
- For item 5, agent 1 values it the highest (99).
- For item 6, agent 0 values it the highest (97).
- For item 7, agent 1 values it the highest (93).
- For item 8, agent 0 values it the highest (87).

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 3

Adjusting to ensure a balanced distribution (3 items per agent if possible):
- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 5, 7, 8
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 3

This allocation gives each agent an approximately fair share based on their preferences and equal number of items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [5, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
