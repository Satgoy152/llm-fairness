Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  87  98  98  87  64  38  97  43
1  69  13  87  93  31  39  89  64  84
2  70  47  44  55  38  43  32  99  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can employ a strategy that ensures a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives items with the highest possible value to them, while ensuring an even distribution of the total number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (98), Item 3 (98), Item 7 (97), Item 1 (87)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (93), Item 2 (87), Item 6 (89), Item 8 (84), Item 0 (69)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (99), Item 8 (91), Item 3 (55), Item 0 (70), Item 1 (47)

### Allocation Strategy:

To ensure fairness, each agent should ideally get 3 items. We will go through each agent's list and allocate the top items, making sure not to assign the same item to multiple agents.

- Assign the top item for each agent, then move to the next available highest item.
- Ensure each agent ends up with 3 items.

### Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 1 (high valuations: 99, 98, 87)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 6, 8 (high valuations: 93, 89, 84)
- **Agent 2**: Items 7, 5, 4 (high valuations: 99, 43, 38)

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 1],
    "1": [3, 6, 8],
    "2": [7, 5, 4]
}
```
