Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  41  56  61  33  12  81  62  97
1  95  48  53  18  87  41  74  64  86
2  87  14  27  17  63   1  28  57  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 41 56 61 33 12 81 62 97]
 [95 48 53 18 87 41 74 64 86]
 [87 14 27 17 63  1 28 57 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to give each agent a similar total valuation of the items they receive. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** Total = 470
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** Total = 566
3. **Agent 2's Valuations:** Total = 357

We aim to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation of their items is as balanced as possible. Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 5 (valuations: 27 + 41 + 12 = 80)
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4, 8 (valuations: 18 + 87 + 86 = 191)
- Agent 2 receives items: 2, 6, 7 (valuations: 27 + 28 + 57 = 112)

This allocation considers the following:
- Each agent has at least some items that they value.
- The total valuation is somewhat balanced across agents.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
