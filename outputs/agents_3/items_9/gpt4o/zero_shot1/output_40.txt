Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  36  13  99  20  80   1  32  28
1  67  23  65  61  72  10  26  83  67
2  63  25  53   0  16  63  96  41  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least a few items, if possible. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where we try to maximize the total value assigned to each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3: Value = 99
   - Item 5: Value = 80
   - Total Value = 179

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 4: Value = 72
   - Item 7: Value = 83
   - Item 1: Value = 23
   - Total Value = 178

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 6: Value = 96
   - Item 0: Value = 63
   - Item 8: Value = 67
   - Item 2: Value = 53
   - Total Value = 279

Each agent receives items based on maximizing their total value while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 7, 1],
    "2": [6, 0, 8, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed to the agents while considering their individual valuations.
