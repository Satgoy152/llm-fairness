Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27   1  13  17  54  46  68  42  79
1  17  50  12  11  62  19  15  24  47
2  35  51  28  30  87  70  35   2  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the preferences of each agent and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Let's analyze the item values for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [27, 1, 13, 17, 54, 46, 68, 42, 79]
- Agent 1 values: [17, 50, 12, 11, 62, 19, 15, 24, 47]
- Agent 2 values: [35, 51, 28, 30, 87, 70, 35, 2, 92]

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share of high-value items:

1. Start by giving the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets 3 items since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Allocation strategy:

- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (value 92).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 87).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 70).
  
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 27).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 68).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 42).

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 50).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 11).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 12).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items and maximizes their individual total valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 8]
}
```
