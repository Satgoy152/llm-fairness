Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  32  25  91  30  66  85  81   4
1   7  52  42  50  32  59  98   5  19
2  85  36  73  76  85  59  18  58  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [85 36 73 76 85 59 18 58 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. There are 9 items in total, and each agent should receive approximately 3 items since there are 3 agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 3, 6, and 7 highly compared to others. Allocating these items to them maximizes their total valuation.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 6 the most, but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we look for the next highest values which are items 5 and 1. We can also give them item 4 to make up their three items.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values items 0, 2, and 8 highly compared to others. Allocating these items to them maximizes their total valuation.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items, and the distribution is fairly based on their valuations.
