Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  43  80   6  20  47  40  78  41
1  47  36  87  19  28  67  52  50  91
2  76  28  84  66  80  81  84  78  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to use a greedy method, assigning items based on the highest valuation not yet allocated.

Let's start the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   Valuations: [57, 43, 80, 6, 20, 47, 40, 78, 41]
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (80)
   - Next highest: Item 7 (78)
   - Next: Item 0 (57)

2. **Agent 1:**
   Valuations: [47, 36, 87, 19, 28, 67, 52, 50, 91]
   - Highest valuation: Item 8 (91)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (67)
   - Next: Item 6 (52)

3. **Agent 2:**
   Valuations: [76, 28, 84, 66, 80, 81, 84, 78, 32]
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (80)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (81)
   - Next: Item 2 (84)

In this setup, we will focus on balancing allocations. Letâ€™s adjust to ensure all items are allocated fairly:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2

After reallocating, we ensure all items are distributed and agents have an integer number of items:

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 0],
    "1": [8, 5, 1],
    "2": [4, 3, 6]
}
```

This distribution allows each agent to receive a fair share of items based on their highest valuations.
