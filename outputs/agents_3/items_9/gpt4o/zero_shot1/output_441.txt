Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42   7  53   8  81  11  52  28  19
1  30  37  42  58  37  78  94  85  30
2  19  11   6  62  53  68  88  98  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will first consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent:** Each agent should get a similar total valuation to ensure fairness.

2. **Assign Items to Agents:** We will try to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 0: 42
- Item 5: 11
- Item 6: 52
- Total Valuation: 42 + 11 + 52 = 105

**Agent 1:**
- Item 3: 58
- Item 4: 37
- Item 8: 30
- Total Valuation: 58 + 37 + 30 = 125

**Agent 2:**
- Item 1: 11
- Item 2: 6
- Item 7: 98
- Total Valuation: 11 + 6 + 98 = 115

This allocation tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives. The allocation can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
