Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  20  42  92  72  82  98  92  27
1  50  94  54  52  43  17  83  72  48
2  65  92  85  14   2  27  28  77  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that the distribution feels equitable. We'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent given their preferences, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 7.

Given these preferences, we can try to balance the allocation as follows:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.
2. Adjust if necessary to ensure fairness and equity.

A possible fair allocation of items might be:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 8]
- Agent 2: [4, 5, 7]

This allocation considers high-valued items for each agent while distributing the total number of items fairly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, matching the total of nine items available.
