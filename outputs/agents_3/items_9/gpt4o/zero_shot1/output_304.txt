Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  43  15  48  74  36  93  20  80
1  63  71  90  17  64  84  26  30  71
2  75  62  23  70  91  25   4  93  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [75 62 23 70 91 25  4 93 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for those items. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0: 6 (93), 8 (80)
   - Allocate items [6, 8] to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1: 2 (90), 5 (84)
   - Allocate items [2, 5] to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2: 4 (91), 7 (93), 0 (75)
   - Allocate items [4, 7, 0] to Agent 2

4. **Remaining items**:
   - Items [1, 3] are left unallocated.
   - Agent 0 needs 1 more item, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0
   - Agent 1 needs 1 more item, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 1],
    "1": [2, 5, 3],
    "2": [4, 7, 0]
}
```
