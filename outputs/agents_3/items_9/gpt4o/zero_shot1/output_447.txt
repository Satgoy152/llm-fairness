Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  92  20  59  36  16  59  44  39
1  56  76  75  43  81  70  94  49  49
2   7  77  38  43  58  24  41  83  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 77 38 43 58 24 41 83 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has on the items and ensure a balanced distribution. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items with higher valuations, such as 1, 3, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with higher values for this agent, such as 4, 6, and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items like 5, 8, and 0, which are relatively more valuable for this agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 2],
    "2": [5, 8, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on each agent's valuations while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.
