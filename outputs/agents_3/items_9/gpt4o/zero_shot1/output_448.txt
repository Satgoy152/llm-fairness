Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  22  99   9   9  22  49  22  42
1  81  21  11  32  31  77  36  85  37
2  27   9  48  12  79  79  93  72  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the items and their valuations by each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Values items highly are 0 (82), 2 (99)
- **Agent 1**: Values items highly are 0 (81), 5 (77), 7 (85)
- **Agent 2**: Values items highly are 4 (79), 5 (79), 6 (93)

Since we need to distribute all 9 items fairly, let's start by assigning the items based on the highest valuations.

1. **Assign item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 at 81, and Agent 2 at 27.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Assign item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 11, and Agent 2 at 48.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Assign item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 85, and Agent 2 at 72.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Assign item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 77, and Agent 2 at 79.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

5. **Assign item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49, Agent 1 at 36, and Agent 2 at 93.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

6. **Assign item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 31, and Agent 2 at 79.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

7. **Assign item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 21, and Agent 2 at 9.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

8. **Assign item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 32, and Agent 2 at 12.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

9. **Assign item 8**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 37, and Agent 2 at 57.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while distributing all items. Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 1],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [5, 6, 4, 8]
}
```
