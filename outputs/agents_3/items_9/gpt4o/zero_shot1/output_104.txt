Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  43  82  29  89  95  57  10   5
1  54   0  16  18  48  33  96  93  80
2  68  53   6  45  92   9  53  34  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 5, and 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 6, 7, and 8.
3. Agent 2 has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [6, 7, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
