Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  40  29  14  15  56  50  65  94
1  52  84  36  39  86  30  51  75  88
2  15  13  77  54   9  11  88  43  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while also distributing all 9 items without any duplication. One approach is to use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets by selecting items based on their highest valuations first. 

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 78.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 84.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 77.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 54.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 86.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 56.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 88.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 75.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 94.

Let's ensure each agent receives an appropriate number of items and adjust if necessary. A fair allocation would typically ensure all agents have a similar number of items, but given we have 9 items and 3 agents, each should receive 3 items.

Reallocating to maintain fairness:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 6]

This allocation provides each agent with 3 items, ensuring a fair distribution while considering their valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
