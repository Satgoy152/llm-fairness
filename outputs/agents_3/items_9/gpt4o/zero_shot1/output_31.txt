Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  25   9  64  96  44  14  87  79
1  80  26  15  50  44  80  97  66   3
2  33  46  64  87  23  71  84  87  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation by assigning them items they value highly. Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items based on maximizing the overall value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Agent valuations for each item:
- Agent 0: [37, 25, 9, 64, 96, 44, 14, 87, 79]
- Agent 1: [80, 26, 15, 50, 44, 80, 97, 66, 3]
- Agent 2: [33, 46, 64, 87, 23, 71, 84, 87, 74]

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (96), Item 7 (87), Item 3 (64)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 0 (80), Item 5 (80)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 7 (87), Item 6 (84)

**Initial Allocation by Maximum Valuations:**

- Agent 0: Item 4, Item 7, Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 6, Item 0, Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2, Item 1, Item 8

**Review Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [4, 7]
- Agent 1: [6, 0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 1, 2, 8]

Let's allocate so that each agent gets an approximately equal number of items:

- Agent 0: [4, 7, 1]
- Agent 1: [6, 0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 2, 8]

This allocation fairly distributes the items across the agents, considering their valuation preferences.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 1],
    "1": [6, 0, 5],
    "2": [3, 2, 8]
}
```
