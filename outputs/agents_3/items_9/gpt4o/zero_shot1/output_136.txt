Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  83   4  92  73  94  27  27  19
1  42  34  37  43  26  71   4  97  72
2  23  39  11  15  97  33  21   2   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Let's analyze and distribute the items based on the valuations in the table.

### Step 1: Analyze the Valuations
We have the following valuations for the agents:

- Agent 0: 69, 83, 4, 92, 73, 94, 27, 27, 19
- Agent 1: 42, 34, 37, 43, 26, 71, 4, 97, 72
- Agent 2: 23, 39, 11, 15, 97, 33, 21, 2, 3

### Step 2: Initial Allocation Strategy
We will initially allocate the items based on the highest value for each item among the agents to maximize individual satisfaction:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (69)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (83)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (37)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (92)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (97)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (94)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (27)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (97)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (72)

### Step 3: Balance the Allocation
Upon reviewing the allocation, Agent 0 has more items than the others. We need to balance the allocation so that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's redistribute some items to ensure a fair allocation.

### Step 4: Final Allocation
Let's adjust the allocation to achieve a more balanced distribution:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (69)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (83)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (37)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (92)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (97)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (71)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (21)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1 (97)
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 2 (3)

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
