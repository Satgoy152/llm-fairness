Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  41   0  20  57   4  32  17  74
1  64  42  91  55  91  13  82  30  80
2   6  38  46  74  64  66  93  68  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives a satisfactory allocation based on their valuations. 

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent based on their preferences.
2. Ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items, given the total is 9 items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest values: 88 (item 0), 74 (item 8), 57 (item 4)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest values: 91 (item 2), 91 (item 4), 82 (item 6)
  
- Agent 2:
  - Highest values: 93 (item 6), 74 (item 3), 68 (item 7)

We can start by assigning the highest value items to each agent and then adjust to ensure each agent has an integer number of items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2.

Now, ensure each agent receives a fair number of items:

- Agent 0 has item 0.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has item 6.

Next, allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 8 to agent 0 (second-highest for agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (tied highest for agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (second-highest for agent 2).

Now, each agent has 2 items. Let's allocate the remaining 3 items to balance:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 1],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [6, 3, 5]
}
```
