Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  32  41   5  82  86  53  49  54
1  98  88  25  48  92  73  42  91  11
2  58  88  12  33  38  84  47  16  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can consider maximizing the total utility (sum of valuations) for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Maximize Total Value for Each Agent**: Since each agent has a different valuation for each item, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is maximized and fairly distributed.

2. **Fair Distribution of Items**: Ensure that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items, given that there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuations are for items 4 (82), 5 (86), and 6 (53).
  - Allocate items 4, 5, and 6 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 0 (98), 1 (88), and 7 (91).
  - Allocate items 0, 1, and 7 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest valuations are for items 2 (58), 3 (33), and 8 (36).
  - Allocate items 2, 3, and 8 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to give each agent three items, maximizing their respective valuations for those items:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items, and the distribution of total value across agents is reasonably balanced given the constraints.
