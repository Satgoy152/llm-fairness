Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  84  51  45  81  15  21  93  76
1  51  91   5  29  83  44  10  83   1
2  36  47  27   4  58  20  21  83  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least some items if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
2. Balance the allocation by considering the remaining items.

Let's start by finding the highest valuations for each item and assigning them accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (51), Agent 2 (36), Agent 0 (2)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (91), Agent 2 (47), Agent 0 (84)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (51), Agent 1 (5), Agent 2 (27)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (45), Agent 1 (29), Agent 2 (4)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (83), Agent 0 (81), Agent 2 (58)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (44), Agent 2 (20), Agent 0 (15)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (21), Agent 1 (10), Agent 0 (21)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (93), Agent 1 (83), Agent 2 (83)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (76), Agent 2 (37), Agent 1 (1)

We'll try to assign items to maximize each agent's total value. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 5
- Agent 2: Items 6, 8

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share, and no item is left unallocated. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [6, 8]
}
```
