Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   1  37  54  42  42  49  95  22
1  54   7   2  61   5  61  48  26  94
2  34  89  39  73   8  56  85  16   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. We can use a heuristic approach to distribute the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent ends up with approximately an equal number of items, given that there are 9 items and 3 agents.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 0 + 1 + 37 + 54 + 42 + 42 + 49 + 95 + 22 = 342
- Agent 1: 54 + 7 + 2 + 61 + 5 + 61 + 48 + 26 + 94 = 358
- Agent 2: 34 + 89 + 39 + 73 + 8 + 56 + 85 + 16 + 9 = 409

Let's now allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (54), Agent 2 (34), Agent 0 (0) => Assign to Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 2 (89), Agent 0 (1), Agent 1 (7) => Assign to Agent 2
- Item 2: Agent 0 (37), Agent 2 (39), Agent 1 (2) => Assign to Agent 2
- Item 3: Agent 1 (61), Agent 2 (73), Agent 0 (54) => Assign to Agent 2
- Item 4: Agent 0 (42), Agent 1 (5), Agent 2 (8) => Assign to Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 1 (61), Agent 2 (56), Agent 0 (42) => Assign to Agent 1
- Item 6: Agent 2 (85), Agent 0 (49), Agent 1 (48) => Assign to Agent 2
- Item 7: Agent 0 (95), Agent 1 (26), Agent 2 (16) => Assign to Agent 0
- Item 8: Agent 1 (94), Agent 2 (9), Agent 0 (22) => Assign to Agent 1

Now check the allocation to ensure it is balanced:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 3, 6]

Each agent has been allocated items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```
