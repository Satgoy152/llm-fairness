Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  53  38  42  25  21  85  35  47
1  85  45  44   7  25  36  69  76  29
2  30  48  92  51  10  77  93  30  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the total valuation each agent has and aim to balance the overall satisfaction. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Start by calculating the total value an agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to assign items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

By reviewing the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: [88, 53, 38, 42, 25, 21, 85, 35, 47]
- Agent 1's valuations: [85, 45, 44, 7, 25, 36, 69, 76, 29]
- Agent 2's valuations: [30, 48, 92, 51, 10, 77, 93, 30, 43]

Total valuations:
- Agent 0: 434
- Agent 1: 416
- Agent 2: 474

To achieve a balanced distribution, let's allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while trying to balance the overall distribution.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 7] (value: 88 + 21 + 35 = 144)
- Agent 1: [1, 6, 8] (value: 45 + 69 + 29 = 143)
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 4] (value: 92 + 51 + 10 = 153)

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
