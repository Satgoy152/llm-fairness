Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  23  84  24  34  11  82  19  93
1  68  26   6  33  14  74  79  28  49
2  60  29  68  46  22  11  74  66  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with highest values: 8 (93), 0 (89), 2 (84), 6 (82).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items with highest values: 5 (74), 6 (79), 0 (68).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items with highest values: 2 (68), 6 (74), 3 (46).

We'll start by allocating items based on the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Assign the highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 8 (93)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (79)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (68)

2. **Continue with remaining items:**
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 0 (89)
   - Agent 1: Next highest is item 5 (74)
   - Agent 2: Next highest is item 3 (46)

3. **Final items left to allocate:**
   - Items 1, 4, 7

4. **Assign remaining based on second highest valuations or fairness:**
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (19)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (14)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (29)

This ensures all items are fairly allocated based on their valuations, and each agent gets a chance to receive items they value.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0, 7],
    "1": [6, 5, 4],
    "2": [2, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and the distribution maximizes the perceived value based on their valuations.
