Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  22  97  79  70  31  98  47  92
1  63  29  33  55  40  40  50  81  11
2  42  99  89  20  83  90  19  89  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 22 97 79 70 31 98 47 92]
 [63 29 33 55 40 40 50 81 11]
 [42 99 89 20 83 90 19 89 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations from the table and allocate items accordingly:

### Valuations Table
```
Agent 0: [35, 22, 97, 79, 70, 31, 98, 47, 92]
Agent 1: [63, 29, 33, 55, 40, 40, 50, 81, 11]
Agent 2: [42, 99, 89, 20, 83, 90, 19, 89, 15]
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with the highest valuations for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Next, allocate items to Agent 1, considering their highest valuations among remaining items.
3. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate items to Agent 2, based on their highest valuations among leftover items.

### Allocation Process
Let's allocate items step by step:

- **Step 1**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6 with a value of 98.
- **Step 2**: Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 1 with a value of 99.
- **Step 3**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2 with a value of 97.
- **Step 4**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 8 with a value of 92.
- **Step 5**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 with a value of 90.
- **Step 6**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 7 with a value of 89.
- **Step 7**: Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3 with a value of 79.
- **Step 8**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4 with a value of 83.
- **Step 9**: Agent 1 is left with item 0 with a value of 63.

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items [6, 2, 8, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5, 7, 4]

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 8, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5, 7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated fairly among the agents.
