Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  80   7  30  18  17  12  77  86
1  97  72  36  96  45  94  84  29  36
2  23  94  38  20  44  55  66  35  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will consider the valuations given by each agent and aim to maximize or balance the total value received by each agent. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive all items. This helps us understand each agent's preference.
2. Allocate items to agents by prioritizing items that agents value the most while ensuring a fair distribution of the total number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [8, 80, 7, 30, 18, 17, 12, 77, 86]
Agent 1's valuations: [97, 72, 36, 96, 45, 94, 84, 29, 36]
Agent 2's valuations: [23, 94, 38, 20, 44, 55, 66, 35, 13]

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 4, and 6.

Let's assign items based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets 3 items:

- Agent 0: [1, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 6]

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. The allocation is relatively fair based on each agent's preferences and their highest valuation items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
