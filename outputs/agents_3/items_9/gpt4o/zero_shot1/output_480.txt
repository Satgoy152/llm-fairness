Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  10  66  39  13  72  99  71  94
1  31   3  15  10  18  63  69  67  93
2  55  60  65  56  31  99  34  91  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 10 66 39 13 72 99 71 94]
 [31  3 15 10 18 63 69 67 93]
 [55 60 65 56 31 99 34 91 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations, while also balancing the distribution of the total number of items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items with high valuations for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Focus on items with high valuations for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Focus on items with high valuations for agent 2.

After reviewing the valuations, the items can be allocated as follows:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6, 8, and 0. 
- Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations across the board but can take items 4 and 7. 
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5, 3, 1, and 2.

With this strategy, we aim for balance in the number of items each agent receives while considering their valuations.

### Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
