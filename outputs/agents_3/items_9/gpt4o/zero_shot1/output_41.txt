Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  26  74  24  34  68   0  15  39
1  41  72  37  77  46  76  72  17  35
2  80  35  98  60  40   9  93  68  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll look for a way to distribute the items so that each agent receives roughly equal value. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: We start by identifying which items hold the highest value for each agent to ensure that each agent receives their most valued items if possible.

2. **Allocate Items**: Based on the highest valuations, we allocate items to agents while ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items (in this case, 3 items each since there are 9 items and 3 agents).

Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 2 (value 74)
  - Item 5 (value 68)
  - Item 4 (value 34)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 3 (value 77)
  - Item 1 (value 72)
  - Item 6 (value 72)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 0 (value 80)
  - Item 7 (value 68)
  - Item 8 (value 24)

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation of the items.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 6],
    "2": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent 3 items, totaling all 9 items, ensuring fairness based on the given valuations.
