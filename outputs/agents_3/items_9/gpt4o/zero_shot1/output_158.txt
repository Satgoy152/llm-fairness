Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  58  37  64  58  26  40  23  45
1  51  10  88   4  74  10  23  19  32
2  54   3  28  68  45  37  58  95  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the total value each agent places on the items and try to balance the allocations so that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 53 + 58 + 37 + 64 + 58 + 26 + 40 + 23 + 45 = 404
   - Agent 1: 51 + 10 + 88 + 4 + 74 + 10 + 23 + 19 + 32 = 311
   - Agent 2: 54 + 3 + 28 + 68 + 45 + 37 + 58 + 95 + 25 = 413

2. **Rank Items by Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: Items ranked by valuation: 3(64), 1(58), 4(58), 0(53), 8(45), 2(37), 6(40), 5(26), 7(23)
   - Agent 1: Items ranked by valuation: 2(88), 4(74), 0(51), 8(32), 6(23), 7(19), 1(10), 5(10), 3(4)
   - Agent 2: Items ranked by valuation: 7(95), 3(68), 6(58), 0(54), 4(45), 5(37), 2(28), 8(25), 1(3)

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7, so allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Continue Allocation with Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 as it has the second highest valuation for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 as it has the second highest valuation for Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 as it has the second highest valuation for Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 as it has a high valuation for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 as it has a high valuation for Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 as it has a high valuation for Agent 2.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 0
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 8
   - Agent 2: Items 7, 6, 5

The allocation balances the total valuation each agent receives as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 0],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [7, 6, 5]
}
```
