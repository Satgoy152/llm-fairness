Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  73  16  61  29  15  62  29   1
1  31  45  97  15  78  19  96   9  36
2  97  42   1  49  51  89  30  44  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign items with relatively higher personal valuations: Item 3 (61), Item 6 (62)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items with relatively higher personal valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 4 (78), Item 6 (96)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items with relatively higher personal valuations: Item 0 (97), Item 5 (89), Item 7 (44)

Let's verify the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 3, 6
- **Agent 1**: 2, 4, 8
- **Agent 2**: 0, 1, 5, 7

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 3 agents. Now, I'll present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```
