Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  58  15  96  44  20  39  37  67
1  40  92  38  25  98  54  12  93  47
2  71  18  36  98  32  53  47  96   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Here's how we can do it for the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 71.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 38.
4. Item 3: Agents 0 and 2 both value it at 98. We'll assign it to Agent 0 for diversification.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 53.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 39.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness and consider the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

After ensuring a fair distribution, the allocation will be:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
