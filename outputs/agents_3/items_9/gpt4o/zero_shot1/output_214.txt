Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  15  29   8  87  54   0  80  31
1  23  74   6  92  97  28  34  24  85
2  39  66   7  40  87  19  51  12  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. In doing so, we'll ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued items and distribute them accordingly to optimize the total value for each agent.

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** 
   - Highest values: 87 (item 4), 80 (item 7), 54 (item 5)
 
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Highest values: 97 (item 4), 92 (item 3), 85 (item 8)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - Highest values: 92 (item 8), 87 (item 4), 66 (item 1)

We'll need to ensure each item is only allocated to one agent.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Item 4** is the most valued by Agent 1, with a value of 97.
- **Item 8** is highly valued by Agent 2, with a value of 92.
- **Item 7** goes to Agent 0, valued at 80.
- **Item 3** goes to Agent 1, valued at 92.
- **Item 1** goes to Agent 2, valued at 66.
- **Item 5** goes to Agent 0, valued at 54.
- **Item 0** goes to Agent 2, valued at 39.
- **Item 2** goes to Agent 0, valued at 29.
- **Item 6** goes to Agent 1, valued at 34.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5, 2],
    "1": [4, 3, 6],
    "2": [8, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
