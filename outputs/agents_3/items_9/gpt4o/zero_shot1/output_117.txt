Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  82  11  84  77  32  63  64  97
1  10  42   8  79  85   9  58  35  66
2   1  33   7  59  61  18  70  81  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed. The objective is to distribute the items so that each agent's total value for their allocated items is maximized.

Let's analyze the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items: 1 (82), 3 (84), 4 (77), and 8 (97).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations on items: 4 (85), 3 (79), 8 (66), and 0 (10).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations on items: 7 (81), 6 (70), 4 (61), and 3 (59).

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent.

#### Allocation Strategy:
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most (81).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (82).
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (70).
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it higher than others (28).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it higher than others, but considering balance, give to Agent 2 (18).
- **Item 2**: To balance the allocation, give to Agent 1 (8).

After ensuring each item is allocated and the distribution is as fair as possible, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3, 1, 0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [7, 6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with agent 0 receiving the items they value most highly, and items distributed in a way that maximizes total utility across all agents.
