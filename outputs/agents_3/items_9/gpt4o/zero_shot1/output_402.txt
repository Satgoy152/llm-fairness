Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  53  30  66  71  16  35  92  67
1   1  52  48  26  40  30  82  67  81
2  40  63  53  27  17  24  24  26  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives as close to an equal number of items as possible.

Here's one approach to achieving this:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent valuations while ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's compute the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 5 + 53 + 30 + 66 + 71 + 16 + 35 + 92 + 67 = 435
- Agent 1: 1 + 52 + 48 + 26 + 40 + 30 + 82 + 67 + 81 = 427
- Agent 2: 40 + 63 + 53 + 27 + 17 + 24 + 24 + 26 + 42 = 316

Now, allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 7, 4, 3, and 8.
- Agent 1 values items 8, 6, 2, and 7.
- Agent 2 values items 1, 2, and 0.

Allocate the items to balance the allocation and maximize each agent's preference:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 4, 3
- Agent 1: Items 8, 6, 2
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5, 0

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and the overall value is maximized for each agent based on their preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 3],
    "1": [8, 6, 2],
    "2": [1, 5, 0]
}
```
