Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  76  47  51  15  22   2  50  52
1  86  78  16  55  80  44  45  19  17
2  52  72  26  92  68  53   7   0  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to aim for a balanced distribution of value or number of items. Given the different valuations, one approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each gets an equitable number of items.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

- Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:
  - Agent 0: 28 + 76 + 47 + 51 + 15 + 22 + 2 + 50 + 52 = 343
  - Agent 1: 86 + 78 + 16 + 55 + 80 + 44 + 45 + 19 + 17 = 440
  - Agent 2: 52 + 72 + 26 + 92 + 68 + 53 + 7 + 0 + 67 = 437

We aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly less satisfied than the others.

1. Assign the highest value item for each agent if possible.
2. Ensure each agent receives 3 items since there are 9 items in total and 3 agents.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0 (28)
  - Item 1 (76)
  - Item 7 (50)
- Agent 1:
  - Item 4 (80)
  - Item 5 (44)
  - Item 6 (45)
- Agent 2:
  - Item 2 (26)
  - Item 3 (92)
  - Item 8 (67)

This allocation gives each agent 3 items with reasonable total valuations.

Now, let's format this into the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
```
