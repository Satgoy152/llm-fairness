Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  52  32  82  47  58  65  30  87
1  48  50  77  39  58  71  45  64   7
2  86  42  18  61  68  82  91  11  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 52 32 82 47 58 65 30 87]

 [86 42 18 61 68 82 91 11 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items. Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Check Fairness**: Ensure that each agent is assigned an approximately equal number of items.
4. **Reallocate if Necessary**: Adjust the allocation to ensure fairness among agents.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Total Valuations

- Agent 0: 42 + 52 + 32 + 82 + 47 + 58 + 65 + 30 + 87 = 495
- Agent 1: 48 + 50 + 77 + 39 + 58 + 71 + 45 + 64 + 7 = 459
- Agent 2: 86 + 42 + 18 + 61 + 68 + 82 + 91 + 11 + 18 = 477

### Step 2: Initial Allocation

Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (86)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (52)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (77)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (82)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (68)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (82)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (91)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (64)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (87)

### Step 3 & 4: Ensure Fairness

Let's ensure each agent gets approximately 3 items since there are 9 items and 3 agents:

Currently:
- Agent 0 has items: [1, 3, 8]
- Agent 1 has items: [2, 7]
- Agent 2 has items: [0, 4, 5, 6]

Reallocate to balance the items:

- Move item 4 from Agent 2 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 5, 6]

### Final JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 5, 6]
}
```
