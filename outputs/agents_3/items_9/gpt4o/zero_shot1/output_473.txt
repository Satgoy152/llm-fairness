Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  94  27  38  95  16  59  42   5
1  20  11   0  46  91  85  77  65  70
2  50  85  16  34   1  83  95  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. One common method is to use a round-robin allocation based on the highest valuation of items by agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose the highest valued item, which is item 4 (value 95).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose the highest valued item, which is item 5 (value 85).
3. **Agent 2**: Choose the highest valued item, which is item 6 (value 95).
4. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is item 1 (value 94).
5. **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is item 8 (value 70).
6. **Agent 2**: Next highest available item is item 7 (value 45).
7. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is item 0 (value 56).
8. **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is item 3 (value 46).
9. **Agent 2**: Next highest available item is item 2 (value 16).

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 0],
    "1": [5, 8, 3],
    "2": [6, 7, 2]
}
```

Each agent gets three items, and all items are distributed, maintaining fairness based on the valuations.
