Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  17  18  20  16  86  68  13  61
1  49  79  26  69  64  21  22  42  79
2  14  79  29  79  87  37   0  21  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on the highest value for each item.

Let's go through the items and assign them to the agent who values them the most:

1. **Item 0** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 64
   - Agent 1: 49
   - Agent 2: 14
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 17
   - Agent 1: 79
   - Agent 2: 79
   - Assign to Agent 1 (since the tie can be broken arbitrarily, choose Agent 1).

3. **Item 2** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 18
   - Agent 1: 26
   - Agent 2: 29
   - Assign to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 20
   - Agent 1: 69
   - Agent 2: 79
   - Assign to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 16
   - Agent 1: 64
   - Agent 2: 87
   - Assign to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 86
   - Agent 1: 21
   - Agent 2: 37
   - Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 68
   - Agent 1: 22
   - Agent 2: 0
   - Assign to Agent 0.

8. **Item 7** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 13
   - Agent 1: 42
   - Agent 2: 21
   - Assign to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8** valuations: 
   - Agent 0: 61
   - Agent 1: 79
   - Agent 2: 81
   - Assign to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and the distribution is based on maximizing the total valuation for each item.
