Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  21  22  78  95  81  19  90  43
1  24   3  14  15  21  22  74  36  21
2  92  27  25  83  79  56  25  98  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[50 21 22 78 95 81 19 90 43]
 [24  3 14 15 21 22 74 36 21]
 [92 27 25 83 79 56 25 98 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

Here's the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  21  22  78  95  81  19  90  43
1  24   3  14  15  21  22  74  36  21
2  92  27  25  83  79  56  25  98  68
```

From this table, we can see that:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

We should aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 0, as they have high valuations for these items (95 and 81, respectively).
2. Assign items 6 and 8 to Agent 1, who values item 6 highly (74) and has a moderate valuation for item 8 (21).
3. Assign items 0, 3, and 7 to Agent 2, who values these items highly (92, 83, and 98, respectively).
4. There are two items left (1 and 2). Assign them to Agent 0, who has moderate valuations for these items (21 and 22).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while distributing all items. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
