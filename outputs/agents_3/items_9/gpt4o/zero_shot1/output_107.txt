Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42   4  58  52  36  87  86  70  63
1  57  35  59  55  51  12  23  99  99
2  59   1  90  40  30  71  81  72  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items while also trying to maximize the overall valuation for each agent. Given there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should receive 3 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 87.
   - The next highest value for agent 0 is item 6 at 86.
   - The third-highest value for agent 0 is item 3 at 52.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 99.
   - The next highest value for agent 1 is item 8 at 99.
   - The third-highest value for agent 1 is item 2 at 59.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 90, but since item 2 is already allocated, we look at the next highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 8 at 94, but since item 8 is already allocated, we look at the next highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 59.
   - The next highest value for agent 2 is item 6 at 81, but since item 6 is already allocated, we look at the next highest.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 at 40, but since item 3 is already allocated, we look at the next highest.
   - Finally, agent 2 values item 4 at 30.

Following this strategy, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 3],
    "1": [7, 8, 2],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated.
