Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  66  41  12  85  84  39  46  88
1  10  82  36  21  96  49   4  11  69
2  94  58  32  98  78  56  56  52  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This problem is akin to a fair division or assignment problem. Let's try to assign items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's an approach to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Items 0, 4, 5, 8 (87, 85, 84, 88)
   - Allocate items with highest values: 0, 4, 8

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Items 4, 1, 5 (96, 82, 49)
   - Allocate items with highest values: 1, 4 (already taken), 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Items 3, 0, 4 (98, 94, 78)
   - Allocate items with highest values: 3, 0 (already taken), 6

Let's go through the allocation step by step to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 6]

After the initial allocation, let's check for remaining items:
- Items 2, 7, and 9 are left.

Now let's allocate the remaining items to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Already has 3 items.
- **Agent 1**: Already has 2 items.
- **Agent 2**: Already has 2 items.

Allocate remaining items considering the next best for each:
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (36)
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (52)
- The remaining item 9 can be allocated to **Agent 1** to balance for fairness.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 2],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation balances the number of items fairly among agents based on their valuations.
