Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  92  29  48  68  27  21  59  57
1  67  86  40  57   1  24  94  60  92
2  57  27  11  52  65  28  88  48  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 86 40 57  1 24 94 60 92]
 [57 27 11 52 65 28 88 48 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations and ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 3 items. 

Let's analyze each agent's valuations to make the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 1 (92), 4 (68), and 0 (56).
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 6 (94), 1 (86), and 8 (92).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 6 (88), 4 (65), and 3 (52).

Based on the above, we need to distribute items in a way that each agent gets approximately an equal number of items and respects their highest preferences as much as possible.

### Allocation Plan

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Assign items: 1, 4, 0 (These are among their highest preferences and no conflicts with other agents for these items).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Assign items: 6, 8, 3 (Item 6 is their top choice, item 8 is highly valued, and item 3 is not particularly contested).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Assign items: 2, 5, 7 (These items are not highly contested by other agents, ensuring a balanced distribution).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and attempts to satisfy the highest preferences as much as possible.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
