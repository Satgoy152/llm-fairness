Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  50  46  99  11  85  63  72   1
1  83  83  60  54   7   8   7  91  78
2  50  79  65  78   9  36  35  44  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 50 46 99 11 85 63 72  1]
 [83 83 60 54  7  8  7 91 78]
 [50 79 65 78  9 36 35 44 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll first look at the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets approximately similar value based on their preferences. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [89, 50, 46, 99, 11, 85, 63, 72, 1]
- Agent 1 values: [83, 83, 60, 54, 7, 8, 7, 91, 78]
- Agent 2 values: [50, 79, 65, 78, 9, 36, 35, 44, 60]

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with highest value: 3 (99), 0 (89), 5 (85)
2. **Agent 1**: Items with highest value: 7 (91), 1 (83), 8 (78)
3. **Agent 2**: Items with highest value: 2 (65), 4 (9), 6 (35)

Checking allocations and ensuring all items are assigned:

- Agent 0 gets items: [3, 0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items: [7, 1, 8]
- Agent 2 gets items: [2, 4, 6]

This allocation gives each agent a fair chance based on their preferences, with each receiving three items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 5],
    "1": [7, 1, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
