Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  67   3  87  84  80  46  44  81
1  57  10  92  79  91  58  33  73  31
2   1   5  71  92  88  71   8  42  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. 

Here is a potential allocation that aims to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent's top preferences and distribute the items accordingly.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a similar total value.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 3, 4, 5, and 8 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 2, 4, and 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 3, 4, 2, and 5 highly.

A possible fair allocation considering these preferences could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 8
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5, 6

This allocation attempts to give each agent a similar overall value based on their preferences.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
