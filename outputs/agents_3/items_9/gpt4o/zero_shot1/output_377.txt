Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  97  65   9  95  22  52  62  29
1  45  23  20  24  17  90  62  12  13
2  94  76  13  76  68  34   3  76  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. One reasonable approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. However, multiple allocation strategies can be considered fair depending on the criteria used (e.g., maximizing overall happiness, ensuring balance, etc.). Here, we'll focus on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 4 (95), Item 0 (67)
   - Allocate: Items 1 and 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (90), Item 6 (62), Item 0 (45)
   - Allocate: Items 5 and 6

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (94), Item 8 (95), Item 1 (76), Item 3 (76), Item 7 (76)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 8, 3, 7, and 2

Let's verify the allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 8, 3, 7, 2

All 9 items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 8, 3, 7, 2]
}
```
