Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  96  74  12  24  54  38  98  51
1  82  65  92  55  36  46  29  41   8
2  87  92  21  49   4  16  92  88  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their total valuation. Let's consider the preferences and valuations for each agent and allocate the items accordingly.

### Item Valuations per Agent
- **Agent 0:** 
  - Total valuation: 463
  - Items and valuations: (0:16), (1:96), (2:74), (3:12), (4:24), (5:54), (6:38), (7:98), (8:51)

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Total valuation: 454
  - Items and valuations: (0:82), (1:65), (2:92), (3:55), (4:36), (5:46), (6:29), (7:41), (8:8)

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Total valuation: 470
  - Items and valuations: (0:87), (1:92), (2:21), (3:49), (4:4), (5:16), (6:92), (7:88), (8:21)

### Allocation Strategy
- We will allocate the highest-valued items for each agent first to ensure they receive items they value highly.
- We need to ensure each agent receives 3 items as there are 9 items in total and 3 agents.

### Allocations
- **Agent 0:** 
  - Select items with the highest valuations: 1 (96), 7 (98), 2 (74)

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Select items with the highest valuations: 0 (82), 2 (92, but already taken), 3 (55), 1 (65, but already taken)
  - Allocate next highest available: 5 (46), 6 (29)

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Select items with the highest valuations: 1 (92, but already taken), 6 (92), 7 (88, but already taken)
  - Allocate next highest available: 3 (49), 8 (21), 4 (4)

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 8, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and the allocations are based on maximizing their individual valuations while ensuring all 9 items are distributed.
