Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  72  84  10  73  19  76  34  86
1  66  16  19  60  82  89  68  79  33
2  26  79  50  53  87  20  75  34  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This involves assigning items to the agents in a way that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

We can start by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the table:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2 (84), 1 (72), 8 (86), and 6 (76).
- Agent 1 has high values for items 5 (89), 4 (82), and 7 (79).
- Agent 2 has high values for items 4 (87), 1 (79), 6 (75), and 3 (53).

Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate items as follows:

1. Assign high-value items based on each agent's preferences, ensuring no overlap.
2. Balance the number of items each agent receives.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 8, 0
- Agent 1: Items 5, 7, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 1, 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and we distribute the items fairly based on their valuations. Now let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8, 0],
    "1": [5, 7, 3],
    "2": [4, 1, 6]
}
```
