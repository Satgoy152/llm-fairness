Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  94  29  63  97  47  99  45  50
1  61  13  55  97  84  66   2  54  58
2  45  95   0  62  65  26   2  84  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the highest valued items for each agent**: We identify the highest valuation each agent has for the items.

2. **Assign items based on highest valuations**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets approximately an equal number of items.

3. **Check and adjust allocation**: Ensure that all items are allocated and adjust if necessary to maintain fairness and balance.

Let's go through the process:

### Step 1: Highest Valuations
- Agent 0 has highest valuations for items: 6 (99), 4 (97), 1 (94)
- Agent 1 has highest valuations for items: 3 (97), 4 (84), 5 (66)
- Agent 2 has highest valuations for items: 1 (95), 7 (84), 8 (79)

### Step 2: Assign Items
- **Agent 0**: Items 6, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 7

### Step 3: Allocate Remaining Items
Remaining items: 0, 2, 8
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1

### Final Allocation
After assigning based on the valuations and balancing the allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 0],
    "1": [3, 5, 2],
    "2": [1, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items with a focus on maximizing their valuations.
