Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  64  39  46  38  67  56  52  39
1  33   4  87  17  90  50  49  15  63
2  47   5  54  52  99  18  26  52  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47  5 54 52 99 18 26 52 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives roughly an equal number of items. Since there are 3 agents and 9 items, ideally each agent should receive 3 items.

Here's an allocation strategy based on maximizing the agents' valuations:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each item by each agent**:
   - Agent 0: 15, 64, 39, 46, 38, 67, 56, 52, 39
   - Agent 1: 33, 4, 87, 17, 90, 50, 49, 15, 63
   - Agent 2: 47, 5, 54, 52, 99, 18, 26, 52, 58

2. **Assign items based on highest individual valuations**:
   - For item 0, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (47).
   - For item 1, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (64).
   - For item 2, Agent 1 has the highest valuation (87).
   - For item 3, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (52).
   - For item 4, Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).
   - For item 5, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (67).
   - For item 6, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (56).
   - For item 7, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (52).
   - For item 8, Agent 1 has the highest valuation (63).

3. **Allocate items ensuring each agent gets 3 items**:
   - Start with the highest valuations and adjust to make sure each agent gets 3 items.

Adjusting for fair distribution while maintaining high valuations:

- Agent 0: [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: [2, 7, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 3, 4]

4. **Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the distribution is based on maximizing the agents' valuations for the items they receive.
