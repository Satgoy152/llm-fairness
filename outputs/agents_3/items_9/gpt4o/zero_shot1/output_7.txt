Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  76  85  55  63  99  94  12  65
1  10  27  77  82  51   4  84  19  64
2  59  65  52  99   5   8  69  79  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one possible approach:

1. **Optimization Strategy**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents.

Let's go through the items and assign them to the agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.

After the initial assignment, we notice that Agent 0 has too many items (6 items), while Agents 1 and 2 have too few (0 and 3 items, respectively).

To balance the allocation, we adjust as follows:
- Reassign Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it second highest at 51.
- Reassign Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, who values it at 77.
- Reassign Item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, who values it at 65.

Now the allocation is:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 5, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3, 7, 8]

This results in a fair distribution of items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
