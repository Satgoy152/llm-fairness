Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  45  81  42  30  77  13  49  27
1  26  66  60  19  59  39  31  82  80
2   3  10   0  55   3  67  60  65  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we can start by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly worse off compared to others. One approach to achieve this is to assign items based on maximizing the value each agent derives from their allocated items, ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal total valuation.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 0: Item 2 (value 81), Item 5 (value 77), Item 1 (value 45)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 1: Item 7 (value 82), Item 8 (value 80), Item 1 (value 66)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 1. Since Item 1 is already allocated, choose the next highest: Item 4 (value 59).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items with the highest value for Agent 2: Item 8 (value 71), Item 7 (value 65), Item 5 (value 67)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 2. Since Item 5 and Item 8 are already allocated, choose the next highest: Item 3 (value 55).

After making sure there are no conflicts and each agent receives a fair share, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of high-value items according to their preferences.
