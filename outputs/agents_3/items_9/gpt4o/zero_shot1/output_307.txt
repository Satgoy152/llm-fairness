Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  45  62  57  73  39  83   8  44
1  89  52  38   8  14  66  77  46  29
2  18  55   0  79  93  91  56  77  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated, we can use a simple greedy approach to maximize total valuation. We'll assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations for items (in descending order): 6 (83), 4 (73), 0 (63), 2 (62), 3 (57), 1 (45), 8 (44), 5 (39), 7 (8).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations for items (in descending order): 0 (89), 6 (77), 5 (66), 1 (52), 7 (46), 2 (38), 8 (29), 4 (14), 3 (8).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations for items (in descending order): 4 (93), 8 (93), 5 (91), 3 (79), 7 (77), 1 (55), 6 (56), 0 (18), 2 (0).

Now, let's allocate items to agents based on these preferences while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (83).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (93).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (89).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (93).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (91).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (79).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (52).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (62).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (8).

Finally, ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 8, 5, 3]
}
```
