Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  90  12  93  14  49  69  52  21
1  57  54  41   2   7  86  21  61  96
2  25  95  22  52  36  71  70  73   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. This is commonly addressed through a method known as "Envy-Free" allocation, although achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible with integer allocations.

Let's start by examining the values:
- Agent 0's highest values: Item 3 (93), Item 1 (90), Item 6 (69)
- Agent 1's highest values: Item 8 (96), Item 5 (86), Item 0 (57)
- Agent 2's highest values: Item 1 (95), Item 7 (73), Item 6 (70)

We need to allocate all 9 items, so we'll allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction where possible, keeping in mind that each agent must get at least one item due to the integer constraint.

Here's one possible allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, and 6 (values: 90, 93, 69)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5, and 8 (values: 57, 86, 96)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4, and 7 (values: 22, 36, 73)

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that are among their most valued, while also making sure all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
