Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  27  31  45   0  44  79  68  14
1  39  20  90  70   5  35  96   2  74
2  66  51  42  93  71  94  16  90  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is as balanced as possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has over all items.
2. Allocate items to agents to balance the total value among them.

Let's go through the allocation process:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Values
- Agent 0: 40 + 27 + 31 + 45 + 0 + 44 + 79 + 68 + 14 = 348
- Agent 1: 39 + 20 + 90 + 70 + 5 + 35 + 96 + 2 + 74 = 431
- Agent 2: 66 + 51 + 42 + 93 + 71 + 94 + 16 + 90 + 35 = 558

### Step 2: Allocate Items
Try to distribute the items such that each agent has a balanced share of total value, considering their individual valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items: 0, 1, 5
  - Total Value: 40 + 27 + 44 = 111

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items: 2, 4, 8
  - Total Value: 90 + 5 + 74 = 169

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items: 3, 6, 7
  - Total Value: 93 + 16 + 90 = 199

### Final Allocations
The allocations can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the total value as fairly as possible given the constraints.
