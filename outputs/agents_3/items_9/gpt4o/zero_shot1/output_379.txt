Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21   9  52  69  86  71  76  94   2
1   3  50  77  72   1  25  60  88  26
2  89   1  46  48  40  18  42  77  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

- Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:
  - Agent 0: 21 + 9 + 52 + 69 + 86 + 71 + 76 + 94 + 2 = 480
  - Agent 1: 3 + 50 + 77 + 72 + 1 + 25 + 60 + 88 + 26 = 402
  - Agent 2: 89 + 1 + 46 + 48 + 40 + 18 + 42 + 77 + 88 = 449

- Aim to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

One possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 7, 8

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 86 + 71 + 76 = 233
- Agent 1: 50 + 77 + 72 = 199
- Agent 2: 89 + 77 + 88 = 254

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation is one way to distribute the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
