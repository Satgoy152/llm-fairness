Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  36  65   7  76  70  73  16  16
1  68  66  25  79  73  61   9  39  31
2  27  93  73  29  56  30  72  61  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the 9 items among the 3 agents (0, 1, and 2), we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, while ensuring that each receives an integer number of items.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Sort items by value for each agent**: For each agent, sort the items based on their valuations in descending order. This helps in determining which items are most valuable to each agent.

2. **Initial allocation**: Start by allocating the item with the highest value to each agent. This ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

3. **Distribute remaining items**: Continue allocating the remaining items by considering the next highest valued items for each agent, and ensuring that no agent receives more than a fair share.

Below is a possible fair allocation of the items based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (76), followed by item 6 (73).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (79), followed by item 0 (68).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (93), followed by item 2 (73).

Following this process, here is a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items [4, 6]
- **Agent 1** gets items [3, 0, 5]
- **Agent 2** gets items [1, 2, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, and all 9 items are distributed. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3, 0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation can be adjusted as long as it maintains fairness and all items are allocated.
