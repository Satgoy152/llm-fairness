Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  13  35  85  29  30   3  19  69
1  75  21  69  21  81  91  47  67  76
2  49  40  43  98  73  72  43  47  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 13 35 85 29 30  3 19 69]
 [75 21 69 21 81 91 47 67 76]
 [49 40 43 98 73 72 43 47 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an approximately equal share of total value, while each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent and each item:

- Agent 0: 36 + 13 + 35 + 85 + 29 + 30 + 3 + 19 + 69 = 319
- Agent 1: 75 + 21 + 69 + 21 + 81 + 91 + 47 + 67 + 76 = 548
- Agent 2: 49 + 40 + 43 + 98 + 73 + 72 + 43 + 47 + 82 = 547

2. Distribute items to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items: [3, 0, 2] (values: 85, 36, 35; total = 156)
- Agent 1 receives items: [5, 4, 8] (values: 91, 81, 76; total = 248)
- Agent 2 receives items: [7, 6, 1] (values: 47, 43, 40; total = 143)

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total value as closely as possible.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [5, 4, 8],
    "2": [7, 6, 1]
}
```
