Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  78  10  59  17  96  49  30  86
1  49  17   9  57  26  66  28   4  43
2  42  37  70  66  30  44  36  61  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to try and maximize the happiness or utility of each agent based on the valuations given. We'll go through a process to allocate the items in a way that aims to balance the satisfaction among the agents.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most.
2. **Balance the Load**: If any agent ends up with more items, consider reallocating items from agents with more items to those with fewer items, ensuring that the total value for each agent remains reasonable.

### Allocation Process

#### Agent 0
- Highest value items: 5 (96), 1 (78), 8 (86)
- Allocate items: [5, 1, 8]

#### Agent 1
- Highest value items: 5 (66), 0 (49), 3 (57)
- Allocate item: [5, 0, 3]

#### Agent 2
- Highest value items: 8 (87), 2 (70), 3 (66)
- Allocate items: [8, 2, 3]

### Adjustments
- We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item and no item is allocated more than once.
- Agent 0 receives item 5, but agent 1 also wants it. Therefore, let's give agent 0 items [1, 4], agent 1 items [0, 3], and agent 2 items [2, 5, 6, 7, 8].

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items based on their highest valuations.
