Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  83  26  66  55  85  76  24  39
1  12   8  19  77   3  55  27  89  86
2   8  59  75  87  22  34  55  86  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 59 75 87 22 34 55 86 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their assigned items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 26 + 83 + 26 + 66 + 55 + 85 + 76 + 24 + 39 = 480
- Agent 1: 12 + 8 + 19 + 77 + 3 + 55 + 27 + 89 + 86 = 376
- Agent 2: 8 + 59 + 75 + 87 + 22 + 34 + 55 + 86 + 62 = 488

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: We'll try to give Agent 0 the items for which they have higher relative valuations.
   - Item 1 (83), Item 5 (85), Item 6 (76)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values significantly higher compared to others.
   - Item 3 (77), Item 7 (89), Item 8 (86)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values higher compared to others.
   - Item 2 (75), Item 4 (22), Item 0 (8)

Let's check that all items have been allocated and each agent has received items:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 5, 6].
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 7, 8].
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 4, 0].

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 0]
}
```
