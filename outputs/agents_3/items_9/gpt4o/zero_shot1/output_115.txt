Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  34  82  12  56  93  94  66  60
1  97   1  75  57  60  66  59  30  16
2   0  91  30  63  61  91  45  27  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 34 82 12 56 93 94 66 60]
 [97  1 75 57 60 66 59 30 16]
 [ 0 91 30 63 61 91 45 27 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated. We can use a simple greedy approach to assign the items to the agents based on their valuations.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0 valuations: [65, 34, 82, 12, 56, 93, 94, 66, 60]
- Agent 1 valuations: [97, 1, 75, 57, 60, 66, 59, 30, 16]
- Agent 2 valuations: [0, 91, 30, 63, 61, 91, 45, 27, 46]

Our task is to allocate the items such that the total valuation is high and each agent gets an integer number of items.

1. Start by identifying the highest value items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Highest value is for item 6 (94), followed by item 5 (93), then item 2 (82).
   - Agent 1: Highest value is for item 0 (97), followed by item 2 (75), then item 5 (66).
   - Agent 2: Highest value is for item 1 (91), followed by item 5 (91), then item 3 (63).

2. Allocate based on the highest unique values:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 6 (94), item 5 (93)
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 0 (97), item 2 (75)
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 1 (91), item 3 (63)

3. Allocate remaining items based on the next highest values and ensuring each agent gets at least 2 items:
   - Remaining items: 4, 7, 8
     - Agent 0: Allocate item 4 (56)
     - Agent 1: Allocate item 8 (16)
     - Agent 2: Allocate item 7 (27)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```
