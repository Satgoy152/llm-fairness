Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  53  85  23  99  14  17  58  54
1  14  45  96  68  24  29  82   8  90
2  64  37  93  94  36  58  84  75  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This involves examining the valuation matrix and finding an allocation that balances the total value each agent gets.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first to ensure fairness.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize total utility while maintaining fairness.

Let's start by identifying the highest-valued item for each agent:

- Agent 0's highest value is for item 4 (value 99).
- Agent 1's highest value is for item 2 (value 96).
- Agent 2's highest value is for item 3 (value 94).

Now allocate these items:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.

Next, allocate the remaining items:

Remaining items: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8

Let's allocate these items based on maximizing additional utility:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (value 5), 1 (value 53)
- Agent 1: Items 6 (value 82), 8 (value 90)
- Agent 2: Items 5 (value 58), 7 (value 75)

The allocations are:

Agent 0: [4, 0, 1]
Agent 1: [2, 6, 8]
Agent 2: [3, 5, 7]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation.
