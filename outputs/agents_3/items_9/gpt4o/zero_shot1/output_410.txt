Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  98  26  29  46  55  26  21  32
1  46  66  46   8  78  65  81  58  34
2  48  52  18  97  69  69  54   9  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. We can use a strategy that attempts to balance these goals. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 0 (91) and 1 (98).
   - Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for items 6 (81) and also values item 4 (78) highly.
   - Allocate items 6 and 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (97) and also values item 8 (81) highly.
   - Allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - The remaining items 2, 5, and 7 need to be allocated.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, who values it at 65, which is higher than the other agents.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, who values it at 26, which is the highest among the remaining options.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0, who values it at 21, which is higher than Agent 2's valuation.

Based on the above strategy, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items that they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.
