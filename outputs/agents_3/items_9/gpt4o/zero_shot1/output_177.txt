Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  47  54  88  79  11  74  58  91
1  96  80   5  40  76  49  58  69   0
2  96  34  39  16  75  62  21  13   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. We will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that balances high values across all agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 8. Allocating these items to Agent 0 would give them a total valuation of 61 + 88 + 91 = 240.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 4, and 7. However, item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0. So, we allocate items 1, 4, and 7 to Agent 1, giving them a total valuation of 80 + 76 + 69 = 225.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 5, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0. We allocate items 5, 2, and 6 to Agent 2, giving them a total valuation of 62 + 39 + 21 = 122.

With this allocation, each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [5, 2, 6]
}
```
