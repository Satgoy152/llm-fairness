Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  82  53   5   1  98  58  56  12
1  23   7   9  97  46  58  24  35  56
2  94  13  17   1  22  66   7  78  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it most at 94.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it most at 82.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it most at 53.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it most at 97.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it most at 46.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it most at 98.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it most at 58.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it most at 78.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it most at 56.

Now, ensuring that each agent receives items fairly and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 has been allocated items: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 1 has been allocated items: 3, 4, 8
- Agent 2 has been allocated items: 0, 7

This results in:

- Agent 0: 4 items
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 2 items

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 7]
}
```
