Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76   5  42  23  99  86  24  31  80
1  47  15  49  13  48  78  58  91  84
2  80  50  99  37   1   1  22  36  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's overall satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a round-robin allocation where each agent takes turns picking their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **List the items and valuations**: Each agent has a list of values for each item.
2. **Round-robin selection**: Each agent picks their most valued available item in turn.
3. **Repeat the process**: Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Let's carry out this allocation:

- Agent 0's highest value item is item 4 (value 99).
- Agent 1's highest value item is item 7 (value 91).
- Agent 2's highest value item is item 2 (value 99).

After the first round:
- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.

Remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8.

Next round:
- Agent 0's next highest value item is item 8 (value 80).
- Agent 1's next highest value item is item 8 (value 84), but it's already taken, so their next is item 5 (value 78).
- Agent 2's next highest value item is item 0 (value 80).

After the second round:
- Agent 0 gets item 8.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.

Remaining items: 1, 3, 6.

Final round:
- Agent 0's next highest value item is item 6 (value 24).
- Agent 1's next highest value item is item 6 (value 58), but it's taken, so their next is item 3 (value 13).
- Agent 2's next highest value item is item 1 (value 50).

After the final round:
- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.

Now all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8, 6],
    "1": [7, 5, 3],
    "2": [2, 0, 1]
}
```
