Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  71  76  60  60  65  47  48   4
1  87   5  68  90  62  55  31  89  81
2  57  10  24  74  13  55  74  25  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 10 24 74 13 55 74 25 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items amongst the agents, we can try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while also ensuring that each agent receives approximately an equal number of items. Since there are 9 items to allocate and 3 agents, we can aim to give each agent 3 items.

Let's evaluate the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (76), Item 1 (71), Item 5 (65)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (90), Item 0 (87), Item 7 (89)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (74), Item 8 (74), Item 3 (74) [Choosing item 4 due to non-availability of item 3]

Considering the non-overlapping highest valuations, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items with the highest valuation that are not taken by other agents: Item 2, Item 1, Item 5
- Agent 1 gets items with the highest valuation that are not taken by other agents: Item 3, Item 0, Item 7
- Agent 2 gets the remaining items: Item 6, Item 8, Item 4

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 0, 7],
    "2": [6, 8, 4]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, totaling 9 items, with a focus on maximizing their individual valuations.
