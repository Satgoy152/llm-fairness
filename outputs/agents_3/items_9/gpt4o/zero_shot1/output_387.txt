Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  27  27  12  89   6  78  22  41
1  42  84  19  78  33  94  54  74  82
2  13  85  46  56  39  84  65  69  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent’s valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives or to balance the total value assigned to each agent.

Let's allocate the items considering the highest valuations first:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (89), 6 (78), and 0 (34).
   - Assign items 4 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 (94), 1 (84), and 3 (78).
   - Assign items 5 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations are for items 1 (85), 5 (84), and 6 (65). (Items 1 and 5 are already allocated)
   - Assign item 2 (46) and item 7 (69) to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. Let's continue allocating the remaining items to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 0 (34) and item 8 (41).
- Agent 1: Assign item 3 (78).
- Agent 2: Assign item 2 (46).

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:
- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are allocated.

Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 0, 8],
    "1": [5, 1, 3],
    "2": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation should ensure a fair distribution based on the given valuations, with each agent having a reasonable share of their preferred items.
