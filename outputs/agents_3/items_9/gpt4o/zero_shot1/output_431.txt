Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  28  78  85  89   2  72  12  68
1  54  50  40  73  88  10  20  62  23
2  22   4  94  59  26  80  31  72  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction. One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has, ensuring each agent receives at least some items if possible.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (89), Item 3 (85), Item 2 (78)
   - Allocate Items 4, 3, and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (88), Item 3 (73), Item 1 (50)
   - Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Items 3 (already allocated), 1, and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 8 (87), Item 5 (80)
   - Item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Items 8, 5, and 6 to Agent 2.

Given the above analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while distributing all 9 items among the agents.
