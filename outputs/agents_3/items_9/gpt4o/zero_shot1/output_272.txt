Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  83   9  21  24   0  17  65  66
1  45  98  94  18  51  15  52  21  78
2  35  96  66  12  42  36  61   1   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We should also try to distribute the items in a way that doesn't drastically favor any single agent over the others.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 0 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 1 and item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly as well, but item 2 is less valuable compared to agent 1.

To make a fair allocation, we'll assign items based on high-value preferences and try to balance the value received by each agent:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 98).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 94) due to high valuation.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 21).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 51) as agent 2 has lower valuation.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 36).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 61).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 65).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (value 78).

During allocation, make sure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Now let's formalize this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a set of items based on their valuations, aiming to maximize fairness and value.
