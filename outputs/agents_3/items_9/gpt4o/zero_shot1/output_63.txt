Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  41  90  22  60  19  20  46  70
1  26   7  26  54  37  46  47  48  50
2  73  40  92  83  16  57   5  21  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated in total. A fair allocation can be achieved by maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Let's go through the valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 41, 90, 22, 60, 19, 20, 46, 70]
- Agent 1: [26, 7, 26, 54, 37, 46, 47, 48, 50]
- Agent 2: [73, 40, 92, 83, 16, 57, 5, 21, 69]

A possible fair allocation can be as follows:

1. Assign items to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2 (90) and item 8 (70).
   - Allocate items [2, 8] to Agent 0.

2. Assign items to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 has moderate values across several items; however, they have higher valuations for items 3 (54) and 6 (47).
   - Allocate items [3, 6] to Agent 1.

3. Assign items to Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 has high values for items 0 (73), 1 (40), 4 (16), 5 (57), and 7 (21).
   - Allocate items [0, 1, 4, 5, 7] to Agent 2.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 8] (values: 90, 70)
- Agent 1: [3, 6] (values: 54, 47)
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7] (values: 73, 40, 16, 57, 21)

All 9 items are allocated, and each agent is receiving an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 5, 7]
}
```
