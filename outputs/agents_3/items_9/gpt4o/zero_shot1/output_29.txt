Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  97  58  53  42  37  97  82  20
1   1  12  43  83  82  73  40  86  77
2  97  76  14   6  29  22  74  57  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent. This often involves finding allocations that ensure each agent has a fair share of the total valuation, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with a heuristic approach to allocate items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items to agents by considering the highest valuation for each item and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust to ensure each agent has an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated equals 9.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Valuations: [47, 1, 97] → Assign to Agent 2 (97 is highest).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Valuations: [97, 12, 76] → Assign to Agent 0 (97 is highest).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Valuations: [58, 43, 14] → Assign to Agent 0 (58 is highest).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Valuations: [53, 83, 6] → Assign to Agent 1 (83 is highest).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Valuations: [42, 82, 29] → Assign to Agent 1 (82 is highest).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Valuations: [37, 73, 22] → Assign to Agent 1 (73 is highest).

7. **Item 6:**
   - Valuations: [97, 40, 74] → Assign to Agent 0 (97 is highest).

8. **Item 7:**
   - Valuations: [82, 86, 57] → Assign to Agent 1 (86 is highest).

9. **Item 8:**
   - Valuations: [20, 77, 48] → Assign to Agent 1 (77 is highest).

After allocation, we need to ensure that the distribution is fair and all items are allocated. Let's summarize the allocations:

**Allocations Summary:**

- Agent 0 has items 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 has items 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Agent 2 has item 0.

All items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    "2": [0]
}
```
