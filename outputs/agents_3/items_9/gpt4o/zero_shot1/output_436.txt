Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  45  33  96  73  40  11  85  76
1  84  56  31  42  32  37  14  21  63
2  91  60  66  56  58  61  72  77  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents by considering their valuations. One way to do this is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal share of high-valued items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 0 (64), Item 4 (73)
   - Assign items 3, 0, and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 1 (56), Item 8 (63)
   - Assign items 8, 1, and 5 to Agent 1 (avoiding item 0 which is already assigned).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (91), Item 8 (85), Item 7 (77)
   - Assign items 6, 2, and 7 to Agent 2 (avoiding items 0 and 8 which are already assigned).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items, and the allocation is fair based on their preferences. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 4],
    "1": [8, 1, 5],
    "2": [6, 2, 7]
}
```
