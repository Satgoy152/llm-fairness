Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  72  94  42  49  78  58  15  45
1  52  49  72   1  17  68  87  37  59
2  37  32  82  60  49  61  71   1   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 72 94 42 49 78 58 15 45]
 [52 49 72  1 17 68 87 37 59]
 [37 32 82 60 49 61 71  1  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.

Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly, but it's already assigned to Agent 0, so we look for the next best options.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 7, 8
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items, and the overall preference is maximized based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [6, 7, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and maximizes the total valuation for each agent.
