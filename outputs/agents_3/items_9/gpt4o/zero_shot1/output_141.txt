Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  61  58  75  35  43  49  84  12
1   7  37  86  10  69  64  21  68  38
2  24  48  61  63   5  76  36  51  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Letâ€™s distribute the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for any remaining item until all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
   - Check and adjust if needed to ensure all items are allocated.

2. **Step-by-step Allocation**:
   - Start by assigning items based on the highest value for each item among agents.
   - Adjust the allocation if needed to ensure fairness, considering the total number of items each agent receives.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (value 62 is the highest)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 61 is the highest)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 86 is the highest)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value 75 is the highest)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 69 is the highest)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 76 is the highest)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (value 21 is the highest, but adjust for balance)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (value 84 is the highest)
   - Item 8: Agent 1 (value 38 is the highest)

4. **Adjustments for Fair Allocation**:
   - Ensure each agent has a fair share of items. Redistribute if necessary to ensure each agent gets close to an equal number of items.
   - Adjust to ensure each agent has a minimum of 2 items, and redistribute item 6 to Agent 2 for balance.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 4, 8]
   - Agent 2: Items [5, 6]

Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6]
}
```

This ensures a fair distribution of items where each agent gets a reasonable allocation based on their valuations while adhering to the constraint of assigning 9 items in total.
