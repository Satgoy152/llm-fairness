Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  79  92  30  49  62   9  90  14
1  33  59  26  89  80  98   1  85  35
2  76  11   2  51  87  35  45  43  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Assign items based on the highest value each agent has for the items, ensuring that each item is only assigned once and each agent has a reasonable number of items.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated, making adjustments if necessary to balance the distribution.

Based on the valuations provided, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4, 5, and 8.

A potential distribution could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, maximizing each agent's total valuation based on the given matrix.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6, 8]
}
```
