Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  33  50  67  49  23  62  38  64
1  61   0  23  82  33   5  55  18  36
2  11  59  93  87  72  49  14  89  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the agents' valuations for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. One common approach is to use a method that aims to balance the valuations among the agents, ensuring that each gets a fair share according to their own preferences.

Here is one potential allocation:

1. Start by assigning the items that have the highest value for each agent, ensuring that no item is assigned more than once.
2. Then, distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations that have not yet been assigned.

Following these steps, we can come up with an allocation as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 3, 6, and 8.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 1, 5, and 7.

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on the highest preferences of each agent, ensuring that each agent receives three items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
