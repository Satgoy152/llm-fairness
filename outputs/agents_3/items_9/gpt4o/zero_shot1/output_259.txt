Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  39  11  27  11  81  33  48  29
1  34  77  14  57  26   1  63  53  66
2  13  32  15  40  52  78  96  29  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them in such a way that each agent is satisfied with the items they receive, based on their valuations. We'll consider each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to distribute them evenly while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable total value.

First, let's examine the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Values item 5 the most (81), followed by item 1 (39) and item 7 (48).
- Agent 1: Values item 1 the most (77), followed by item 8 (66) and item 3 (57).
- Agent 2: Values item 6 the most (96), followed by item 5 (78) and item 4 (52).

Given this, let's try an allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their most valued item if possible, ensuring no conflicts.
2. Continue assigning items to maintain balanced distribution and total value for each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 7 (values: 81, 48).
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 3, and 8 (values: 77, 57, 66).
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 6, 2, and 4 (values: 30, 96, 15, 52).

This allocation ensures each agent has a reasonable share of their preferred items based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 8],
    "2": [0, 6, 2, 4]
}
```
