Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  31  11  14   3  43  78  53   0
1  68  35  41  73  67  20  41  47  59
2  74  11   0  80  21  99  40  73  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[23 31 11 14  3 43 78 53  0]
 [68 35 41 73 67 20 41 47 59]
 [74 11  0 80 21 99 40 73 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an approximately equal number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. 

Let's evaluate the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 6: 78
   - Item 5: 43
   - Item 7: 53

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 3: 73
   - Item 0: 68
   - Item 4: 67

3. **Agent 2's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 5: 99 (but already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Item 3: 80 (but already allocated to Agent 1)
   - Item 0: 74 (but already allocated to Agent 1)
   - Item 7: 73 (but already allocated to Agent 0)
   - Item 8: 63

As items 5, 3, 0, and 7 are already allocated, Agent 2 will take:
   - Item 8: 63
   - Item 1: 11
   - Item 2: 0

Let's check if this satisfies the constraint:
- Agent 0: [6, 5, 7] (Items: 3)
- Agent 1: [3, 0, 4] (Items: 3)
- Agent 2: [8, 1, 2] (Items: 3)

Each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 0, 4],
    "2": [8, 1, 2]
}
```
