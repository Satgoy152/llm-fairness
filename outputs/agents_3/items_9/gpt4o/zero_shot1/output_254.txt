Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  26   8  81  63  41  32   2   4
1  87  10  85  52  45  49   0  27  89
2  52  23  67  44  87  66  94  99  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. We can use a step-by-step approach to find a reasonable allocation:

1. **List each agentâ€™s total valuations for all items:**

- Agent 0: 31, 26, 8, 81, 63, 41, 32, 2, 4
- Agent 1: 87, 10, 85, 52, 45, 49, 0, 27, 89
- Agent 2: 52, 23, 67, 44, 87, 66, 94, 99, 64

2. **Assign items to agents such that the total value for each agent is balanced:**

- Start by selecting items with the highest valuations per agent.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (third-highest valuation for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (third-highest valuation for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (third-highest valuation for Agent 0).

4. **Ensure no items are left unallocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.**

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1],
    "1": [8, 2, 0],
    "2": [7, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with relatively high valuations for them, balancing the total value among agents as fairly as possible.
