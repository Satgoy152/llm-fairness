Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  78  44  26  47  21  98  44  96
1   0  62  69  50  97  32  70  16  58
2  93  39  49  42  62  50  35  33  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 78 44 26 47 21 98 44 96]
 [ 0 62 69 50 97 32 70 16 58]
 [93 39 49 42 62 50 35 33 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to take into account the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [55, 78, 44, 26, 47, 21, 98, 44, 96]
Agent 1: [0, 62, 69, 50, 97, 32, 70, 16, 58]
Agent 2: [93, 39, 49, 42, 62, 50, 35, 33, 28]
```

We need to allocate all 9 items among the 3 agents. Let's aim for an allocation where each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 6, and 8.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4, 2, and 6.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 2.

### Allocating Items
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 6 (value: 98)
  - Item 8 (value: 96)
  - Item 1 (value: 78)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 4 (value: 97)
  - Item 2 (value: 69)
  - Item 3 (value: 50)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0 (value: 93)
  - Item 5 (value: 50)
  - Item 7 (value: 33)

### Final Allocation
Here's how the items are allocated to each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 1],
    "1": [4, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that have relatively higher valuations for them, balancing the distribution based on the given preferences.
