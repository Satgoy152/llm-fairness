Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  63  79  48   6  97  19  75  84
1   4  93  25  39  15  60  97  61  38
2  42  64   6  81  23  29  36  89  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 63 79 48  6 97 19 75 84]
 [ 4 93 25 39 15 60 97 61 38]
 [42 64  6 81 23 29 36 89 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we should consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation. One common approach is to use a method that allocates items to maximize the minimum satisfaction among the agents, ensuring fairness.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items: 5 (97), 2 (79), 8 (84).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items: 1 (93), 6 (97).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for items: 3 (81), 7 (89).

Now, let's try to assign items based on these preferences while balancing the number of items each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 8] - Total valuation: 74 + 79 + 84 = 237
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4, 6] - Total valuation: 93 + 15 + 97 = 205
- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 5, 7] - Total valuation: 81 + 29 + 89 = 199

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and it distributes the total valuation fairly among the agents based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
