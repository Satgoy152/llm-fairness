Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11   4  54  42  18  90  70  68   7
1  45  18  44  64  20  96  55  23   5
2  48   3  83  71  83  99  60  22  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This is a variant of the "maximum weighted matching" problem. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will try to assign items to Agent 0 that they value highly compared to the other agents, but not necessarily the highest for each item, as we need to balance the allocation.

2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, we assign items to Agent 1 where they also have a relatively high valuation compared to Agent 0 and Agent 2, ensuring a fair distribution.

3. **Agent 2**: Lastly, assign items to Agent 2 based on their highest remaining valuations, again keeping fairness in mind.

Here is one potential fair allocation of items:

- Assign item 5 and item 7 to Agent 0, since they have high values (90 and 68, respectively) for Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 and item 6 to Agent 1, since they value these items (64 and 55, respectively) reasonably high.
- Assign item 2, item 4, and item 8 to Agent 2, as these items hold high values for them (83, 83, and 54, respectively).
- Finally, assign item 0 to Agent 1 and item 1 to Agent 2 to balance the allocation and ensure each agent gets a fair share.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.
