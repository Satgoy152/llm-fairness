Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  12  68  90  20  20  24   2  44
1  19   3  97  62  27  84  89  97  70
2  12  93  36  14  96  83  65  59  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets items that maximize their total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should receive approximately 3 items.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they receive the item.
2. Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their personal total value.

We'll follow these steps to make the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (90), 2 (68), 8 (44)
   - Allocate items 3, 2, and 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 7 (97), 2 (97), 6 (89), 5 (84) 
   - Since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocate items 7, 6, and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (96), 8 (95), 1 (93), 5 (83)
   - Since item 8 is already allocated to Agent 0 and item 5 to Agent 1, allocate items 4, 0, and 1 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 3 items and maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 8],
    "1": [7, 6, 5],
    "2": [4, 0, 1]
}
```
