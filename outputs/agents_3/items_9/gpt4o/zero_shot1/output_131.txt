Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  39  27   3  76  57  85  83  96
1  11  64  87  28  82  27  55  12  86
2  43  67  46  51  26  97  45  50   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach could be to maximize the total value each agent receives or try to balance the allocations based on the agents' preferences.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Needs to be allocated items that maximize their value. Their highest valued items are: 8 (96), 6 (85), 7 (83), 4 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: Their highest valued items are: 2 (87), 4 (82), 8 (86), 1 (64).
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valued items are: 5 (97), 1 (67), 3 (51), 2 (46).

We'll try to assign items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Will be assigned items [8, 6, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Will be assigned items [2, 4, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Will be assigned items [5, 1, 0]

Each agent receives 3 items, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 3],
    "2": [5, 1, 0]
}
```
