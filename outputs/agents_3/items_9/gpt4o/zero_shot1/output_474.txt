Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  91  78  21  17  49  14  40  24
1  62  14  19  21  82  37  94  46  88
2  47  27  82  69  56  18  69  62  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 91 78 21 17 49 14 40 24]
 [62 14 19 21 82 37 94 46 88]
 [47 27 82 69 56 18 69 62 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. One such method is the "round-robin" method, where we iteratively assign the highest-valued item available to each agent in turn. Let's apply this to the given data:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is for item 1 (91).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 6 (94).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 2 (82).

4. **Agent 0:** Next highest value item 2 is taken, so item 0 (32).
5. **Agent 1:** Next highest value item 4 (82).
6. **Agent 2:** Next highest value item 3 (69).

7. **Agent 0:** Next highest value item 3 is taken, so item 7 (40).
8. **Agent 1:** Next highest value item 8 (88).
9. **Agent 2:** Next highest value item 5 (18).

This allocation ensures that each agent has been considered in turn and has received items based on their rankings.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 7],
    "1": [6, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items among the three agents, with each agent getting a fair share based on their valuations.
