Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  83  90  58  35  63  73  33   8
1  39  42  50  70  56  67  53  68  20
2  43  39  50  10   6  13  72  41   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent:** This step involves examining which items each agent values the most and trying to allocate those items to the respective agents if possible.

2. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations:** We'll start allocating items by focusing on each agent's highest-valued items.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** We'll make sure that each of the nine items is allocated to one of the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0, 1, and 2 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 and 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 very highly.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3, 4, and 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 6, 7, and 8 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
