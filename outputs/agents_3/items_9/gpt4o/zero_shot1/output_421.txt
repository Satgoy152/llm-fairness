Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  15  85   0  93  73  30  62  94
1  21  12  96  33  24  33  80  54  38
2  11  35   5  12  91  44  42  56  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to approach this problem:

1. Analyze each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate those first.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the allocations so that the total value received by each agent is equitable.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 0 (93), 4 (93), and 8 (94). Let's allocate items 0 and 8.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is 2 (96). Let's allocate item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 8 (94) and 4 (91). Since item 8 is already taken, allocate item 4.

Now, we have allocated 4 items: 0, 2, 4, and 8.

Next, allocate the remaining items focusing on balancing the values:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 0 and 8. Allocate item 5 (73) to increase total value.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 2. Allocate items 3 (33) and 6 (80) to increase total value.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 4. Allocate items 1 (35) and 7 (56) to increase total value.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonably fair share based on their valuations.
