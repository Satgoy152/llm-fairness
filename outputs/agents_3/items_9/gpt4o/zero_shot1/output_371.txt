Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14   4  99   1  34   3  35  21   8
1  13  84   8  57  45  13  52  47  33
2  14  48  59  10  52  19  57  21  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's go through the process of determining a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuation for item 2 (99).
   - Moderate valuation for items 0 (14), 4 (34), and 6 (35).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuation for items 1 (84), 3 (57).
   - Moderate valuation for items 4 (45), 6 (52), and 7 (47).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuation for items 2 (59), 6 (57).
   - Moderate valuation for items 1 (48), 4 (52), and 8 (37).

To ensure fairness, let's allocate the items by considering the highest valuations first, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

**Fair Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Items: 2, 0
  - Valuations: 99 (item 2), 14 (item 0)
  - Total valuation: 113

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Items: 1, 3, 7
  - Valuations: 84 (item 1), 57 (item 3), 47 (item 7)
  - Total valuation: 188

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Items: 4, 5, 6, 8
  - Valuations: 52 (item 4), 19 (item 5), 57 (item 6), 37 (item 8)
  - Total valuation: 165

This allocation aims to balance the valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
