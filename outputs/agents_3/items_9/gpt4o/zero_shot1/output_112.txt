Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  21  78  91  71  61  42  45  31
1  74  47  18  84  66  82  40   6  30
2  42   1  65  33  81  56  98   3  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent. It is important to consider the value each agent places on the items to make the allocation fair and balanced.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 should receive items they value highly, such as items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 should receive items they value highly, such as items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 should receive items they value highly, such as items 6 and 8.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: 3 (91), 4 (71)
   - Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: 0 (74), 5 (82)
   - Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: 6 (98), 8 (69)
   - Assign items 6 and 8 to Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 7):

- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items they value relatively highly.
