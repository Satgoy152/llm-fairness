Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  83  58  82  85  69  20   5  30
1  83  25  98  68  41  70  92  17  37
2  28  69  13  45   3  33   1  40  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 69 13 45  3 33  1 40 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will attempt to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the available items, while also ensuring each agent ends up with an equal number of items or as close to equal as possible since we have 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items:  
   - Item 4 (85), Item 3 (82), Item 1 (83)

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items:  
   - Item 2 (98), Item 0 (83), Item 6 (92)

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items:  
   - Item 1 (69), Item 7 (40), Item 3 (45)

Initially, we will allocate the highest valued item for each agent and then proceed to allocate the remaining items based on the next highest-valued preferences.

Allocation steps:

- Assign Agent 0: Item 4 (85), Item 1 (83)
- Assign Agent 1: Item 2 (98), Item 6 (92)
- Assign Agent 2: Item 7 (40), Item 3 (45)

Now we have allocated 6 items. We have 3 more items to assign: Item 0, Item 5, Item 8.

- Assign Agent 0: Item 0 (54)
- Assign Agent 1: Item 5 (70)
- Assign Agent 2: Item 8 (31)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 0],
    "1": [2, 6, 5],
    "2": [7, 3, 8]
}
```
