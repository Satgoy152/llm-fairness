Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  20  20  74  91  59  30  67  43
1  17  32   1  93  97  65  81   0  98
2  60  14  23  56  79   7  19  36  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent gets. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They have relatively high valuations for items 3 and 5. Allocating these items to agent 0 maximizes their total value.

2. **Agent 1**: They have the highest valuations for items 4 and 8. Allocating these items to agent 1 gives them significant value.

3. **Agent 2**: They have high valuations for items 0, 6, and 7. Allocating these items to agent 2 provides them a good value.

Now, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0 can be given items [3, 5].
- Agent 1 can be given items [4, 8].
- Agent 2 can be given items [0, 6, 7].

We have 9 items in total, so we need to distribute the remaining items [1, 2] fairly:

- Agent 0 can take item 1.
- Agent 2 can take item 2.

This allocation is designed to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 6, 7, 2]
}
```
