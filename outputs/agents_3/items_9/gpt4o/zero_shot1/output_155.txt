Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  52  14  24  10  67  10  87  94
1  79  28  22  69  37  27  44  62  62
2  58  84  10  56  16  39  99  69  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider the total valuation each agent gets from a subset of items and distribute the items accordingly.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 52, 14, 24, 10, 67, 10, 87, 94]
- Agent 1: [79, 28, 22, 69, 37, 27, 44, 62, 62]
- Agent 2: [58, 84, 10, 56, 16, 39, 99, 69, 93]

We can start by identifying high-value items for each agent and try to allocate them to maximize their satisfaction.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High-value items: Item 8 (94), Item 7 (87), and Item 5 (67)
   - Let's allocate items 8, 7, and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High-value items: Item 0 (79), Item 3 (69)
   - Let's allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High-value items: Item 6 (99), Item 1 (84), Item 2 (10), and Item 4 (16)
   - Let's allocate items 6, 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's ensure all 9 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 8, 7, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 6, 1, 2, 4

Each agent has been assigned an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 7, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
