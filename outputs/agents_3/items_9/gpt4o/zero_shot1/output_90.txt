Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  39  48  70  42  72  76  41  59
1  41  17  35  10  54  50  45  34  29
2  77   7   9  13  25  66  97  18   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 3, 5, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 and 6 highly.

To distribute fairly, let's allocate items as follows:

- Assign items 3 and 5 to Agent 0, who values them highly.
- Assign items 0, 6, and 7 to Agent 2, who values them highly.
- Assign items 1, 2, 4, and 8 to Agent 1, who values item 4 among others.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a share of the items based on their preferences, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
