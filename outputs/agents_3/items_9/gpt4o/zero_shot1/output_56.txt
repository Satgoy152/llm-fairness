Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  98  30  55  95  45  84  47  30
1  99  34  66  60  35  45  80  61  58
2  81  54  70   0   8  45  64  54  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable value in comparison to the others. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations first while ensuring each agent receives an approximately equal number of items.

Let's go through the process:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 529
   - Agent 1: 538
   - Agent 2: 411

2. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring at the end each agent gets around 3 items (since there are 9 items and 3 agents).

3. Allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for unallocated items, ensuring fairness and balance.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 8

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items and aims to distribute the total valuation fairly among the agents.
