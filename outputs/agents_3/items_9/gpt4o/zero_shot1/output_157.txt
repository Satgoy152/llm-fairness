Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  51  30  44  91  61  85  93  58
1  16  11  44  30  41  68  67  98   2
2  20  63  70  73  42  20  26  93  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is balanced and that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents who value them significantly more than others.**
2. **Ensure each agent receives at least some items, if possible, while maximizing total utility.**

Let's look at the table to determine a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4, 6, and 7.
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 and 7.
- **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 3.

### Allocation Strategy
- Assign items based on the highest unique valuations first.
  
#### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 7** is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1, but Agent 1 values it slightly higher (98 vs. 93). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 0 (91). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 2 (70). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3** is highly valued by Agent 2 (73). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 5** is highly valued by Agent 1 (68). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 6** is highly valued by Agent 0 (85). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
7. **Remaining items**: 0, 1, 8.

Now, allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:
- **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 0 (55). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 2 (63). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- **Item 8** can go to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation (58).

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are allocated.
