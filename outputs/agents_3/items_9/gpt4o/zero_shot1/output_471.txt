Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  19  53  90  47  18  30  42  52
1  20  69  37   9  37  49  18  40  67
2   3  67  78  36  98  36  21   1  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. We'll go through the table and assign items in a way that considers each agent's preferences while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's start by reviewing the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - High valuations: Item 3 (90), Item 2 (53), Item 0 (49), Item 8 (52)
- Agent 1:
  - High valuations: Item 1 (69), Item 8 (67), Item 5 (49), Item 2 (37)
- Agent 2:
  - High valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 8 (79), Item 2 (78), Item 1 (67)

Next, we allocate the items:

1. Allocate the highest unique valuation to each agent:

   - Agent 0 gets Item 3 (90) - highest valuation for Agent 0
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1 (69) - highest valuation for Agent 1
   - Agent 2 gets Item 4 (98) - highest valuation for Agent 2

2. Allocate remaining items by the next highest valuations:

   - Agent 0: Already has Item 3. Next priority is Item 2 (53)
   - Agent 1: Already has Item 1. Next priority is Item 8 (67)
   - Agent 2: Already has Item 4. Next priority is Item 8 (79) but it's already taken, so Item 2 (78)

3. Allocate remaining items:

   - Agent 0 has Items 3 and 2. Next best is Item 0 (49)
   - Agent 1 has Items 1 and 8. Next best is Item 5 (49)
   - Agent 2 has Items 4 and 2. Next best is Item 8, which is taken, so Item 6 (21)

Now all items are allocated. Let's check:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 2, 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 8, 5
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6, 7

This way, each agent gets 3 items, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 0],
    "1": [1, 8, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
