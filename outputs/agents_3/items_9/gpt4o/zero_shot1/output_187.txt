Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53   9  68   0  69  42  12  25  84
1  37  92  69  18  22  29  42  83   7
2  96  94  70  59  20   6  35  35  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. We'll try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent has for the items. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for the items that have significantly higher valuations by a single agent compared to others. These items should be allocated to those agents to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Balance the Total Value**: Ensure that the total value of items allocated to each agent is roughly balanced.

3. **Distribute Items**: Distribute the items one by one, starting with the highest value for each agent, then iterate to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Following these principles, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Prioritize items where Agent 0 has high valuations.
- **Agent 1**: Prioritize items where Agent 1 has high valuations.
- **Agent 2**: Prioritize items where Agent 2 has high valuations.

### Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 (96 is the highest valuation for this item)
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 (92 is the highest valuation for this item)
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 (68 and 69, but Agent 0 has higher unique needs)
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 (59 is the highest valuation for this item)
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 (69 is the highest valuation for this item)
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 (42 is the highest unique valuation for this item)
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 (42 is the highest unique valuation for this item)
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 (83 is the highest valuation for this item)
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 (84 is the highest valuation for this item)

### Resulting JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a balance of high-value items based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
