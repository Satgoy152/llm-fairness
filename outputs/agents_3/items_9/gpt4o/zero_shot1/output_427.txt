Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  14  70  94  25  35  52  37  15
1  48  79  20  52  44  64  40  32   0
2  31  72  57  58  13  96  37  31  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total value of the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and find an allocation that aims to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (94), Item 0 (83), Item 2 (70)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (79), Item 5 (64), Item 3 (52)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (96), Item 8 (69), Item 1 (72)

Based on these preferences, we can try to allocate items to maximize satisfaction:

- **Allocate Item 0** to Agent 0 (value 83).
- **Allocate Item 1** to Agent 2 (value 72).
- **Allocate Item 2** to Agent 0 (value 70).
- **Allocate Item 3** to Agent 0 (value 94).
- **Allocate Item 4** to Agent 1 (value 44).
- **Allocate Item 5** to Agent 2 (value 96).
- **Allocate Item 6** to Agent 0 (value 52).
- **Allocate Item 7** to Agent 1 (value 32).
- **Allocate Item 8** to Agent 2 (value 69).

This allocation ensures each agent gets some high-value items according to their preferences and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
