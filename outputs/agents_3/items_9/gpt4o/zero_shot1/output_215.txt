Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  84  31  81  94  79  41  40  62
1  92  59  76  37  16  29  13  57  30
2  65  93  87   7  63  66  35  18  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A reasonable approach is to ensure that each agent gets a similar sum of valuations for the items they receive. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 1, 3, 6
   - Total Valuation: 84 (Item 1) + 81 (Item 3) + 41 (Item 6) = 206

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 0, 2, 7
   - Total Valuation: 92 (Item 0) + 76 (Item 2) + 57 (Item 7) = 225

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: 4, 5, 8
   - Total Valuation: 63 (Item 4) + 66 (Item 5) + 26 (Item 8) = 155

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items, and the distribution of their valuations is relatively balanced. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are distributed.
