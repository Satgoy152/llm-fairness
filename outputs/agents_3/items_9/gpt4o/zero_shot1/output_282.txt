Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  35   3  12  61  58  85  18  11
1  55  98  39  25  38  35  99  45  61
2  19  22  67  46   3  95  68  82  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable number of items (3 items each, given there are 9 items and 3 agents) and try to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign items that they value relatively highly compared to the other agents.
   - Items 0, 4, and 5 have high valuations for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign items that Agent 1 values more than Agent 0 and 2.
   - Items 1, 6, and 8 are valued highly by Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Assign items that Agent 2 has relatively high valuations for.
   - Items 2, 3, and 7 are valued higher by Agent 2 than Agent 0 and 1.

Allocating the items based on these considerations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 4, 5].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 6, 8].
- Agent 2 gets items [2, 3, 7].

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are assigned.
