Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  52  20  51  80  40  47  54  56
1  71  12  44  26  83   0  20  13  56
2  79  77  77  55   4  15  92  89  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 3 items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will allocate items that have relatively higher valuations for Agent 0 compared to others.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 79, which is high.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, which is the highest.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 54, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation.

2. **Agent 1**: We will allocate items that have relatively higher valuations for Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 44, which is significant for them.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 26, which is higher than other valuations.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 56, which matches Agent 0, but gives Agent 1 a needed third item.

3. **Agent 2**: We will allocate items that have relatively higher valuations for Agent 2.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 77, which is high.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 15, which is necessary to balance allocations.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest among all.

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and the items are distributed based on relative valuations. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 8],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
