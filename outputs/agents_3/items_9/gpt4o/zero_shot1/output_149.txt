Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  85  36  56  12  92  51  69   2
1  59  12  32  52  36  54   1  42  97
2  24  29  69  77  83  75  52  63   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 9 items and 3 agents, so ideally each agent should get 3 items.

Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each gets approximately an equal number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 59 + 85 + 36 + 56 + 12 + 92 + 51 + 69 + 2 = 462
- Agent 1: 59 + 12 + 32 + 52 + 36 + 54 + 1 + 42 + 97 = 385
- Agent 2: 24 + 29 + 69 + 77 + 83 + 75 + 52 + 63 + 9 = 481

Given these total valuations, we should try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Based on the individual item valuations, an optimal allocation strategy might be:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 1, 5, and 7 (valuations: 85, 92, 69)
- Agent 1: Allocate items 0, 8, and 3 (valuations: 59, 97, 52)
- Agent 2: Allocate items 2, 4, and 6 (valuations: 69, 83, 52)

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items and maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 8, 3],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
