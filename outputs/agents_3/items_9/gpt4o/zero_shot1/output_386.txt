Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  39  44  13  91  26  86  24  53
1  36  85  31  84  94  49   9  55   0
2  74  93  83  74  93  33  24  56  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 39 44 13 91 26 86 24 53]
 [36 85 31 84 94 49  9 55  0]
 [74 93 83 74 93 33 24 56 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A fair allocation should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction, considering their preferences as expressed by their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: 71, 39, 44, 13, 91, 26, 86, 24, 53
Agent 1: 36, 85, 31, 84, 94, 49,  9, 55,  0
Agent 2: 74, 93, 83, 74, 93, 33, 24, 56, 21
```

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (91), Item 6 (86), Item 0 (71)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (94), Item 1 (85), Item 3 (84)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 4 (93), Item 2 (83)

Given these preferences, let's proceed with the allocation by attempting to keep each agent's top priorities in mind while ensuring a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Allocates: Item 0, Item 6

- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocates: Item 3, Item 5

- **Agent 2:**
  - Allocates: Item 1, Item 2, Item 4, Item 7, Item 8
   
The allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of high-valued items, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation respects the individual agent's preferences as much as possible while distributing all items among the agents.
