Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  76  59  26  48  18  75  27  84
1  20  97  72  52  37   0  56  21  54
2  19  50  15  14  96  96  40  12  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the maximum valuations for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Make sure each agent gets at least one item if possible, adjusting the allocations as necessary.

Let's go step by step:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 52.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 27.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.

Now let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5

Each agent has been allocated a reasonable number of items based on their maximum valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
