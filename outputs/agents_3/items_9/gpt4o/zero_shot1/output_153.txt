Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  81  16  26  25  91  19  15  34
1  72  60   9  53  44   1  69  46  32
2  32  45  80  88  12  39  92  52  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is somewhat balanced, considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Let's compute the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 91 + 81 + 16 + 26 + 25 + 91 + 19 + 15 + 34 = 398
- Agent 1: 72 + 60 + 9 + 53 + 44 + 1 + 69 + 46 + 32 = 386
- Agent 2: 32 + 45 + 80 + 88 + 12 + 39 + 92 + 52 + 37 = 477

Given that we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items to ensure a fair allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (91), 5 (91), 1 (81)
   - Total items allocated: [0, 1, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (72), 6 (69), 3 (53)
   - Total items allocated: [3, 6, 7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 6 (92), 3 (88), 2 (80)
   - Total items allocated: [2, 4, 8]

Reallocating based on the condition that each agent gets 3 items:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 6, 7]
- Agent 2 gets items [2, 4, 8]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 8]
}
```
