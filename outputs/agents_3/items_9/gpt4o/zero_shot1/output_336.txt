Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  49  18  16  69  64  14  59  86
1  46  93  98  31   7  38  97  37  80
2  85  53  23  63  82  84  13  39  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Here is one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** seems to have a relatively high valuation for items 8 and 4. 
2. **Agent 1** values items 2 and 1 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 and 0 highly.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 8, 4, and 7
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 2, 1, and 3
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 5, 0, and 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets three items, and the total number of allocated items is nine.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 1, 3],
    "2": [5, 0, 6]
}
```
