Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  89   8  39  62  15  76  90  74
1  44  36  68  30  44  67  24  43   3
2  19  31  90  63  24  44  82  80  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54 89  8 39 62 15 76 90 74]
 [44 36 68 30 44 67 24 43  3]
 [19 31 90 63 24 44 82 80 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned to one agent. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. Agent 0: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (89), Item 7 (90)
   - Medium valuations: Item 6 (76), Item 8 (74)

2. Agent 1: 
   - High valuations: Item 2 (68), Item 5 (67)
   - Medium valuations: Item 4 (44), Item 3 (30)

3. Agent 2: 
   - High valuations: Item 2 (90), Item 6 (82)
   - Medium valuations: Item 3 (63), Item 7 (80)

Now, let's allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:

- Agent 0: Allocate high-value items Item 1 (89) and Item 7 (90) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate high-value items Item 2 (68) and Item 5 (67) to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate high-value items Item 6 (82) and Item 3 (63) to Agent 2.

For the remaining items, we need to balance the allocations:
- Allocate Item 8 (74) to Agent 0 for a medium value.
- Allocate Item 4 (44) to Agent 1 for a medium value.
- Allocate Item 0 (19) to Agent 2 to ensure all items are allocated.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 5, 4],
    "2": [6, 3, 0]
}
```
