Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  16   2  85  99  11  86  18  79
1  93  42  92  14  51  49   5  88  17
2  41  80  73  46  42   0  40  30  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 80 73 46 42  0 40 30 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will try to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 4 (99), 3 (85), 6 (86).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 0 (93), 2 (92), 7 (88).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 1 (80), 2 (73), 8 (49).

Now, let's allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0:** We'll allocate items 3, 4, and 6, which have high valuations of 85, 99, and 86 respectively.
2. **Agent 1:** We'll allocate items 0, 2, and 7, which have high valuations of 93, 92, and 88 respectively.
3. **Agent 2:** We'll allocate items 1, 5, and 8, which have valuations of 80, 0, and 49 respectively.

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives high-value items according to their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
