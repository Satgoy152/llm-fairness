Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18   2  21  91  63  71  78  45  67
1  98   3  35  81   1  61   7  33  31
2  24  79  53  46  44  65  53  98  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 3 agents and 9 items, each agent can get 3 items.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation by considering the sum of valuations for each possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0's optimal items:**
   - Items with the highest valuations for Agent 0 are 3, 6, and 5 (valuations: 91, 78, 71).

2. **Agent 1's optimal items:**
   - Items with the highest valuations for Agent 1 are 0, 3, and 2 (valuations: 98, 81, 35).

3. **Agent 2's optimal items:**
   - Items with the highest valuations for Agent 2 are 7, 8, and 1 (valuations: 98, 87, 79).

To ensure no items are allocated more than once and each agent gets exactly 3 items, we need to adjust accordingly:

- **Agent 0 gets items:** 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 1 gets items:** 0, 2, 4
- **Agent 2 gets items:** 1, 7, 8

This allocation allows each agent to have their top-valued items considering no overlaps, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 7, 8]
}
```
