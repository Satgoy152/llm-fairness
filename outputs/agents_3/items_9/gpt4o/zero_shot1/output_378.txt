Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  98  15  68  24  92  91  44  16
1  23  55  17  50   5  35  71  18  65
2  82  85  78  13  94   7  91   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that no agent is left with too few items.

Let's review the valuations and allocate the items:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest value items: Item 1 (98), Item 5 (92), Item 6 (91)

- Agent 1:
  - Highest value items: Item 6 (71), Item 8 (65), Item 1 (55)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest value items: Item 4 (94), Item 0 (82), Item 1 (85)

A potential allocation could be determined by trying to give each agent the items they value most, without overlap:

1. Assign items to maximize the value for each agent without overlapping:

   - Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 6 (total value: 98 + 92 + 91 = 281)
   - Agent 1: Items 3, 8 (total value: 50 + 65 = 115)
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 4, 7 (total value: 82 + 78 + 94 + 3 = 257)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 7]
}
```
