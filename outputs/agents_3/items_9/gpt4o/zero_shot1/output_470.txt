Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  13  12  98  66  23  30   5  79
1  56  73   3  82  46  32  45  60  64
2  29  17  65  93  29  45  39   7  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets roughly an equal share of the items. Given there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get 3 items. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

   - Agent 0: 93 + 13 + 12 + 98 + 66 + 23 + 30 + 5 + 79 = 419
   - Agent 1: 56 + 73 + 3 + 82 + 46 + 32 + 45 + 60 + 64 = 461
   - Agent 2: 29 + 17 + 65 + 93 + 29 + 45 + 39 + 7 + 20 = 344

2. Allocate items by choosing the highest-valued items for each agent in turns, ensuring each agent gets 3 items.

- **Step 1**: Each agent picks their highest valued item:
  - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 98)
  - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 73)
  - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 93)

- **Step 2**: Assign the items based on highest remaining values ensuring no overlaps:
  - Agent 0 has item 3, so they pick item 0 (value 93)
  - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 46)
  - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 65)

- **Step 3**: Assign the remaining items based on highest remaining values:
  - Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 79)
  - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 60)
  - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 45)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and the allocation is based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for their assigned items.
