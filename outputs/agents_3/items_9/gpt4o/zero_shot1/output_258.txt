Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  61  41   9  63  57   4  93   6
1   9  60  71  54  69   4  61  41  94
2  67  43  32  64  21  84   0  58  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to maximize the total value for each agent. We will assign items to agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0 Preferences**:  
   - High valuations: Item 7 (93), Item 4 (63), Item 1 (61)
   
2. **Agent 1 Preferences**:  
   - High valuations: Item 8 (94), Item 2 (71), Item 4 (69)
   
3. **Agent 2 Preferences**:  
   - High valuations: Item 5 (84), Item 8 (78), Item 3 (64)
   
After reviewing the preferences, we will try to allocate items to agents based on maximizing their preferences while ensuring each item is only assigned once. Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Assign high-value items from each agent's perspective, ensuring no conflicts where possible.
- Attempt to balance the number of items each agent receives.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:  
  Items: [0, 1, 7]  
  (Has high value for Item 7 and reasonably high for Items 0 and 1.)

- **Agent 1**:  
  Items: [2, 4, 8]  
  (Has high values for Items 8, 2, and 4.)

- **Agent 2**:  
  Items: [3, 5, 6]  
  (Has high values for Items 5 and 3, and gets Item 6 to balance.)

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the preferences and provides a balanced distribution of items among the agents.
