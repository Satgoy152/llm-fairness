Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  62  60  47  94  79  48  35  14
1   0  22  61  39   0  65  38   7  41
2  77  50   6  41  96  24  73  62  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent:** Sum up each agent's valuations of all items to understand their overall interest in the items.

   - Agent 0: 33 + 62 + 60 + 47 + 94 + 79 + 48 + 35 + 14 = 472
   - Agent 1: 0 + 22 + 61 + 39 + 0 + 65 + 38 + 7 + 41 = 273
   - Agent 2: 77 + 50 + 6 + 41 + 96 + 24 + 73 + 62 + 46 = 475

2. **Maximize the value for each agent by selecting items with the highest value for them:**

   - For Agent 0, prioritize items: 4 (94), 5 (79), 1 (62), 2 (60)
   - For Agent 1, prioritize items: 2 (61), 5 (65), 8 (41), 3 (39)
   - For Agent 2, prioritize items: 4 (96), 0 (77), 6 (73), 7 (62)

3. **Allocate items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed:**

   - Assign Agent 0: items 4, 5, 1 (total valuation = 235)
   - Assign Agent 1: items 2, 8, 3, 7 (total valuation = 148)
   - Assign Agent 2: items 0, 6 (total valuation = 150)

4. **Check allocations to ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Agent 0 has items: 4, 5, 1
   - Agent 1 has items: 2, 8, 3, 7
   - Agent 2 has items: 0, 6

By this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 1],
    "1": [2, 8, 3, 7],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
