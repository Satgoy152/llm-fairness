Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  27   0  77  16  33  95  80  83
1  37  53  30  81  15  85  61  26  94
2  79  21  65  76  11   5  56   3  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. There are 9 items and 3 agents, so each agent should ideally receive 3 items. The allocation will be based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate items with the highest values for agent 0.
   - Items 6 (value 95), 7 (value 80), and 8 (value 83) are the highest valued items for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Allocate items with the highest values for agent 1 that have not already been allocated.
   - Items 5 (value 85), 8 (value 94), and 3 (value 81) are the highest valued for agent 1, but item 8 is already allocated to agent 0. So allocate items 5, 3, and 2 (value 30).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items with the highest values for agent 2 that have not already been allocated.
   - Items 0 (value 79), 3 (value 76), and 2 (value 65) are the highest valued for agent 2, but items 3 and 2 are already allocated. So allocate items 0, 1 (value 21), and 4 (value 11).

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 3, 2],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
