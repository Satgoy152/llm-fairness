Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  61  79  50  25  24   5  84  25
1   9  23  88  49  25  39  62  44  63
2  60  35  98  67  73  74  35  53   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuations of items while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. One way to achieve this is by considering the maximum valuation each agent has for the items and allocating accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assign Highest Valuation Items:**
   - For each item, find the agent who values it the most and allocate it to that agent. 
   - If two agents have the same valuation for an item, choose the one with fewer items assigned so far.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets at Least One Item:**
   - After the initial allocation, check if any agent has not received any items.
   - If so, reallocate items to ensure that each agent has at least one item.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Distribute any remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's apply this to the table:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the most (60).
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most (61).
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the most (98).
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most (67).
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most (73).
- **Item 5:** Agent 2 values it the most (74).
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the most (62).
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most (84).
- **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it the most (63).

After initially assigning based on the highest valuations, the distribution is:
- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [6, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]

To ensure balance, we can adjust the allocation:

- Reallocate item 3 from agent 2 to agent 0.

Now, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share, totaling 9 items allocated among them.
