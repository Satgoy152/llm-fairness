Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89   2  33   0  88  42  99  71  80
1  65  33   1  11  68  99  17  15  42
2  63  46  42  61  82  42  41  94  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0's total value: 89 + 2 + 33 + 0 + 88 + 42 + 99 + 71 + 80 = 504
   - Agent 1's total value: 65 + 33 + 1 + 11 + 68 + 99 + 17 + 15 + 42 = 351
   - Agent 2's total value: 63 + 46 + 42 + 61 + 82 + 42 + 41 + 94 + 34 = 505

2. Allocate items to balance these valuations and ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Prioritize high-value items for this agent.
  - Assign items: 0, 5, 6 (values: 89, 42, 99)

- Agent 1: Balance between this agent's preferences and total items.
  - Assign items: 1, 4, 8 (values: 33, 68, 42)

- Agent 2: Select items that maximize this agent's satisfaction.
  - Assign items: 2, 3, 7 (values: 42, 61, 94)

Now, each agent receives 3 items, and the total allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair portion based on their valuations.
