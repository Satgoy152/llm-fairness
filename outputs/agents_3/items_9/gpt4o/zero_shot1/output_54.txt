Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  69  86  27  20  29  12  57  68
1  76  86   0   5  18  35  98  40  74
2  10  35  29  91   3  73   7  78   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. One approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's examine the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0's preference:**
   - Highest valued items: 2 (86), 1 (69), 8 (68), 7 (57), 3 (27), 5 (29), 0 (9), 4 (20), 6 (12)

2. **Agent 1's preference:**
   - Highest valued items: 6 (98), 1 (86), 0 (76), 8 (74), 5 (35), 4 (18), 3 (5), 7 (40), 2 (0)

3. **Agent 2's preference:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (91), 7 (78), 5 (73), 1 (35), 2 (29), 0 (10), 4 (3), 6 (7), 8 (0)

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing preferences while ensuring each agent gets items and that all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 2, 1, 8. These are some of the highest valued available for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items 6, 0. These are high-valued items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items 3, 7, 5, 4. These are high-valued items for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share while maximizing their satisfaction based on their respective valuations.

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 8],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [3, 7, 5, 4]
}
```
