Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  12  16  74  18  91   3  14  85
1  25  13   2  70  37  42  32  78   7
2   6  13  36  71   7  12  21  52  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6 13 36 71  7 12 21 52 15]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations for the items and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations an agent has for specific items, ensuring that each item is only allocated to one agent and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (31), 3 (74), and 5 (91).
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 7 (78) and 4 (37).
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 (36), 6 (21), and 8 (15).

Let's ensure that each agent gets some items and that the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 6, 8]

In JSON format, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6, 8]
}
```
