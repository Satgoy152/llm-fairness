Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  95  73  32  28  36  74  46  67
1  27  31  38  11  99  86  74  88  62
2   5  84  34  66  22  46  59  20   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we want to ensure that each agent gets a set of items that reflects a fair share of the total value of the items. We will use a simple heuristic to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least some items.

Let's first consider the total value each agent places on all items combined:

- Agent 0: 26 + 95 + 73 + 32 + 28 + 36 + 74 + 46 + 67 = 477
- Agent 1: 27 + 31 + 38 + 11 + 99 + 86 + 74 + 88 + 62 = 516
- Agent 2:  5 + 84 + 34 + 66 + 22 + 46 + 59 + 20 +  5 = 341

Now let's allocate items to agents with a goal of maximizing each agent's total satisfaction:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: [4, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: [3, 8, 0]

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 8, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a portion of the items, and the distribution reflects a balance based on their preferences.
