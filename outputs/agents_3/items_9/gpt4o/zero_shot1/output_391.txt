Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  89  31  61  57  69  73  97  18
1  45  54   4   3   1  24  86  31  10
2  31  95  38  50  92  60   8  32  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 62 + 89 + 31 + 61 + 57 + 69 + 73 + 97 + 18 = 557
- Agent 1: 45 + 54 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 24 + 86 + 31 + 10 = 258
- Agent 2: 31 + 95 + 38 + 50 + 92 + 60 + 8 + 32 + 50 = 456

Now, let's allocate the items by considering the valuations and aiming to balance the total value for each agent.

A possible fair allocation is:

Agent 0:
- Items: 0, 1, 5
- Total value: 62 + 89 + 69 = 220

Agent 1:
- Items: 2, 6, 8
- Total value: 4 + 86 + 10 = 100

Agent 2:
- Items: 3, 4, 7
- Total value: 50 + 92 + 32 = 174

Let's ensure this allocation gives out all items, and each agent receives a reasonable share of the total valuation.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the value received by each agent based on their valuations.
