Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  61  12  60  90  58  20  28  55
1  92  96  56  67  37  89   2   5  33
2   6  29  43  26  60  10   0  60  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent is treated equitably based on their valuations of the items. One common approach for fair allocation is to use a method like maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 1 (61), Item 3 (60)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (92), Item 1 (96), Item 5 (89)
   - Item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, so choose the next highest available: Item 3 (67)
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (60), Item 7 (60)
   - Item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, so choose the next highest available: Item 2 (43)
   - Allocate Items 2 and 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 6 and 8 are left unallocated. Distribute based on remaining valuations:
   - Agent 1 values Item 8 at 33; Agent 2 values it at 14. Allocate Item 8 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 6 at 20; Agent 2 values it at 0. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

After allocating all items, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5, 8],
    "2": [2, 7]
}
```
This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.
