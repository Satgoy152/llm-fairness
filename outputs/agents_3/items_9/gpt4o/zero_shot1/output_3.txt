Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  63  43  26  91  96  61  44  92
1  62  72  25   7  78  27  89  28  19
2  17  76  98  76  85  20  34  46  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 76 98 76 85 20 34 46 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets a similar number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's evaluate the best allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (96), Item 4 (91), Item 8 (92)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (72), Item 4 (78), Item 6 (89)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (98), Item 1 (76), Item 3 (76)

To avoid overlap and ensure fairness, we can adjust the allocation by examining which agent values each item the most and ensure each agent ends up with a similar number of items.

Based on the above analysis, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 5, 8]
- **Agent 1:** Items [1, 4, 6]
- **Agent 2:** Items [2, 3, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and it respects the preferences of each agent based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
