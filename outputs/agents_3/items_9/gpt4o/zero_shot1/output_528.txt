Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  64  46  91  42  73  67  73  16
1   3  99   8  39  36  79  51  19   5
2  33  39   7  79  32  49  66   3  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents based on their valuations, we need to consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized. This approach involves observing the valuations and making decisions to balance the satisfaction across all agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (91), Item 5 (73), Item 7 (73)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (99), Item 5 (79)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (79), Item 6 (66)

2. **Allocate high-value items**:
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item. Despite Agent 2 also valuing it highly, Agent 0 has no other item close in value.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, who values it slightly more than the others.

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate items 0 (13) and 2 (46) because these items are relatively higher for them than for others.
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (36) since they value it more than others.
   - Agent 2: Allocate items 6 (66), 7 (3), and 8 (31) as they have more significant values for Agent 2 compared to others.

The allocations ensure that each agent gets at least some items and tries to maximize their valuations based on the given numbers.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
