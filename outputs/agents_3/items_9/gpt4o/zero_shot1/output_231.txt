Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  55  29  56  11  57  45  80  74
1  47  64  59  83  84  24  82  10  84
2  86  39  23  39  61   3  21  37  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 55 29 56 11 57 45 80 74]
 [47 64 59 83 84 24 82 10 84]
 [86 39 23 39 61  3 21 37 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by identifying high-value items for Agent 0. Items 0, 7, and 8 have high values of 88, 80, and 74, respectively.

2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that have high value for Agent 1 but are not already taken by Agent 0. Items 3, 4, and 6 have values of 83, 84, and 82, respectively.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the remaining items to Agent 2, ensuring they get some value. Items 1, 2, and 5 are left, and they have values of 39, 23, and 3, respectively for Agent 2.

Reviewing the allocations, each agent has been given items to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring all 9 items are distributed:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 7, 8].
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 4, 6].
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 2, 5].

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
