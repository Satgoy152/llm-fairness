Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  98   6  98  61  47  86  15  98
1  66  98  47  55  29  57  35  88  60
2  13   2   6  53  72  33  32   5  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent has a satisfactory overall value. A common approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "maximum satisfaction" method, but given the small number of items and agents, we can manually adjust to optimize satisfaction.

Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [50, 98, 6, 98, 61, 47, 86, 15, 98]
   - High-value items: 1, 3, 8

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [66, 98, 47, 55, 29, 57, 35, 88, 60]
   - High-value items: 0, 7, 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [13, 2, 6, 53, 72, 33, 32, 5, 79]
   - High-value items: 4, 6, 2

Given these preferences, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 7, 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 4, 6, 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that have relatively high values for them, balancing overall satisfaction.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 8],
    "1": [0, 7, 5],
    "2": [4, 6, 2]
}
```
