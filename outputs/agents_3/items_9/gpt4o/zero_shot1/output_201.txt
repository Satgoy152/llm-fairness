Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  29  32  72  10  55  89  59  88
1  11  54  77  76  30  42  51  63  71
2  73  20  18  28  92  78  31  88  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy approach by evaluating which items are most valued by each agent and then allocating those items accordingly, making sure no two agents receive the same item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 and 8. Let's allocate those to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 3. Let's allocate those to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 7. Let's allocate those to Agent 2.

Now we have the remaining items 0, 1, and 5:

4. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 2, so allocate it to Agent 2.
5. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 1.
6. Item 5 is most valued by Agent 2, so allocate it to Agent 2.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 1],
    "2": [4, 7, 0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their valuations based on the given table.
