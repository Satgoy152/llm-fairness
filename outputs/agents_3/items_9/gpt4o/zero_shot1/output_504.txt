Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  78  22  33  79  96   1  93  87
1  37   2   3  84  43  40  75  19  36
2  61  92  87  33  10  43  79  27  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a strategy that considers the preferences of each agent. One approach is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying which items have the highest value for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on these preferences, ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items.

Let's evaluate the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (96), followed by item 7 (93), and item 8 (87).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (84), followed by item 6 (75).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (92), followed by item 2 (87), and item 0 (61).

We can allocate the items as follows to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 5, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 0, 1, and 2.
- We'll give the remaining item 4 to agent 1, as it has a decent value for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the maximum value possible from their allocated items while keeping the distribution fair. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
