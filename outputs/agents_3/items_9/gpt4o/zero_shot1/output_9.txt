Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  33  16   6  52  50  56  15  69
1  54  48  35  13  84  20  52  88  39
2   9   7  23  35  36  32  45  86  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 3 agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints, a balanced approach could be to allocate 3 items to each agent, as there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's follow a simple allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued items first, ensuring no overlap.
2. Continue assigning the next highest valued items available to each agent until all items are allocated.

Here's how we can approach it:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values: Item 8 (69), Item 0 (56), Item 6 (56).
  - Assign these items to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest values: Item 7 (88), Item 4 (84), Item 1 (48).
  - Assign these items to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest values: Item 7 (86), Item 8 (82) are already taken, so next highest available values are Item 3 (35), Item 6 (45) taken, so Item 5 (32) and Item 2 (23).
  - Assign these items to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated.
