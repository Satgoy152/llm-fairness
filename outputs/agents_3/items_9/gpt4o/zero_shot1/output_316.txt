Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  17  39   2  35  25  55  22  35
1  86  60  48  34  72   6  25  41  93
2  61  24  68  17  56  11  94  41   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 17 39  2 35 25 55 22 35]
 [86 60 48 34 72  6 25 41 93]
 [61 24 68 17 56 11 94 41  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their value. One approach to achieve this is to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least some items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value: 93), as Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value: 94), as Agent 2 has the highest valuation for this item.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 83), as Agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 68), as Agent 2 has the second-highest valuation for this item.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value: 72), as Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 60), as Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 25), as Agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item.
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 34), as Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item.
9. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value: 41), as Agent 2 has the highest valuation for this item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences as reflected in the valuation table.
