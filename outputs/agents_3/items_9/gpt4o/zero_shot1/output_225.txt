Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  18   6  10  73  46  13  27  96
1  61  44  61  22  38  85  85  12  18
2  18  85  23  70  67  97  49  19  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would get for each possible allocation and try to equalize them.
2. Allocate items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest valued items for Agent 0 are 8 (96), 4 (73), and 5 (46).
  - Allocating items 8, 4, and 5 to Agent 0.

- Agent 1:
  - Highest valued items for Agent 1 are 5 (85), 6 (85), and 0 (61).
  - Allocating items 6, 0, and 1 to Agent 1.

- Agent 2:
  - Highest valued items for Agent 2 are 5 (97), 1 (85), 3 (70).
  - Agent 0 already has item 5, and Agent 1 has item 1.
  - Allocating items 3, 7, and 2 to Agent 2.

After making adjustments to ensure all items are allocated:

- Revised allocation:
  - Agent 0: Items 8, 4, 7
  - Agent 1: Items 0, 5, 6
  - Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 3

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
