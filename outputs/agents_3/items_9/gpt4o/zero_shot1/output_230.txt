Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  50  90  33  68  54  67  41   8
1  73  77  46  92  67  61  56  55  37
2  43  10  37  77  63  52  60  14  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets an approximately equal share of the total value. Let's review the total valuation each agent has for all items and then distribute the items accordingly:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent
- Agent 0: \(22 + 50 + 90 + 33 + 68 + 54 + 67 + 41 + 8 = 433\)
- Agent 1: \(73 + 77 + 46 + 92 + 67 + 61 + 56 + 55 + 37 = 564\)
- Agent 2: \(43 + 10 + 37 + 77 + 63 + 52 + 60 + 14 + 43 = 399\)

### Step 2: Allocate Items
The allocation should consider maximizing each agent's value while ensuring fairness over the total number of items (9 items). We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar proportion of their total valuation.

#### Allocation Process:
- Assign items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal number of items.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 2 (Value: 90), 4 (Value: 68), 6 (Value: 67)
   - Total Value: 225

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 3 (Value: 92), 1 (Value: 77), 0 (Value: 73)
   - Total Value: 242

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: 5 (Value: 52), 7 (Value: 14), 8 (Value: 43)
   - Total Value: 109

### Final Allocations
Each agent is allocated 3 items, ensuring a fair distribution based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3, 1, 0],
    "2": [5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring a fair distribution of the number of items among the agents.
