Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28   1  39  45  93  35  77  46   6
1  49  80  72  89  80  46  87   2  42
2  83  76  45  43  95  30  48  48  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28  1 39 45 93 35 77 46  6]
 [49 80 72 89 80 46 87  2 42]
 [83 76 45 43 95 30 48 48 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

### Step-by-step Analysis and Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (93)
   - Other high valuations: Item 6 (77), Item 3 (45)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (89)
   - Other high valuations: Item 1 (80), Item 4 (80), Item 6 (87)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (95)
   - Other high valuations: Item 0 (83), Item 1 (76)

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (95)
- **Item 3**: Second highest valuation by Agent 1 (89)
- **Item 6**: Third highest valuation by Agent 1 (87)
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 1 (80) because it has a high value and Agent 1 has already lost Item 4
- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 2 (83) as it has a high value and Agent 2 needs more items
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0 (39), as no other agent prioritizes it
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0 (35), as no other agent highly values it
- **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 0 (46), as no other agent prioritizes it
- **Item 8**: Allocate to Agent 1 (42), as Agent 0 and Agent 2 do not prioritize it

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
