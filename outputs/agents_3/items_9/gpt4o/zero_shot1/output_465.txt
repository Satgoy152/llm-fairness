Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  66  71  91   5  37  99   1  15
1  76  35  83  21  33  25  64  64  73
2  77  84  98  75  20  64  46  57   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share considering their valuations. One approach is to use a method similar to the "max-min fair share" which tries to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Step 1: Assign the highest valued item to the respective agent.**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (99).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (83).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, but since item 2 is already assigned to Agent 1, we consider the next highest which is item 1 (84).

2. **Step 2: Assign remaining items by comparing valuations and trying to balance the total value each agent receives.**
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (76 > 34, 77).
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (91 > 21, 75).
   - Item 4: Assign to Agent 2 (20 > 5, 33).
   - Item 5: Assign to Agent 2 (64 > 37, 25).
   - Item 7: Assign to Agent 1 (64 > 1, 57).
   - Item 8: Assign to Agent 0 (15 > 73, 3).

After this allocation, each agent should have a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items while respecting the agents' preferences as much as possible.
