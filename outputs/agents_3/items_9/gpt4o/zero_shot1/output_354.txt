Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  33  63  88  32  97  71  75  72
1  49   5  43  19   5   7  52   5  33
2  67  35  98   6  89  57  27  30  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 33 63 88 32 97 71 75 72]
 [49  5 43 19  5  7 52  5 33]
 [67 35 98  6 89 57 27 30 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation or trying to balance the perceived value among agents. Since each agent needs to receive an integer number of items and there are 9 items in total, each agent will receive 3 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on maximizing the total value for agent 0 by selecting the items with the highest values that agent 0 values.
   - Items: 5 (value 97), 3 (value 88), and 6 (value 71).

2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, select the top valued items for agent 1.
   - Items: 6 (value 52), 2 (value 43), and 0 (value 49).
   - Note: Item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we need to avoid conflicts by selecting the next best available items.

3. **Agent 2**: Select the top valued items for agent 2.
   - Items: 2 (value 98), 4 (value 89), and 0 (value 67).
   - Note: Items 2 and 0 are already allocated to other agents, so choose the next available highest valued items.

Adjust and finalize allocation for fairness:

- Reassign items to ensure each agent gets 3 items and there are no conflicts:

Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 5, 3, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 6, 1, 7
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4, 0

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 8],
    "1": [6, 1, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items based on their preferences while considering overall fairness.
