Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  57   0   3  99  34  88  66  27
1  31  69  91  56  54  40  37  46   6
2  50  47  64  36   1  59  76  61  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, with the total number of items being exactly 9. A common approach is to use a fair division method such as maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Initial Observation**: 
   - Agent 0 seems to highly value item 4 (99) and item 6 (88).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (91).
   - Agent 2 doesn't have extremely high values for any particular item compared to others but has moderately high values spread out.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items based on high valuations while ensuring a fair distribution across agents.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 6
     - Item 4 (99) and item 6 (88) provide high value to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 1, 3
     - Item 2 (91) is the highest for Agent 1, followed by item 1 (69) and item 3 (56).
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 5, 7, 8
     - Spread across moderately valued items: 0 (50), 5 (59), 7 (61), 8 (51).

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly.
