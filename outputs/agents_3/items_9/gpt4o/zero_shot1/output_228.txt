Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  6  95  67  28  96  74  81  40  74
1  1  66  19  60  89  48  96  67  90
2  9  81  31  52  65  62  90  59  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Let's analyze the table to allocate the items in a way that each agent gets an approximately equal share of the total value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 6 + 95 + 67 + 28 + 96 + 74 + 81 + 40 + 74 = 561
   - Agent 1: 1 + 66 + 19 + 60 + 89 + 48 + 96 + 67 + 90 = 536
   - Agent 2: 9 + 81 + 31 + 52 + 65 + 62 + 90 + 59 + 54 = 503

2. **Allocate Items**: Aim to distribute items so that each agent's total value is balanced.

Let's allocate items one by one:
- **Item 4 (Value Highest for Agent 0)**: Allocate to Agent 0 (Value: 96)
- **Item 6 (Value Highest for Agent 1)**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Value: 96)
- **Item 1 (Value Highest for Agent 2)**: Allocate to Agent 2 (Value: 81)
- **Item 5 (Value Highest for Agent 0)**: Allocate to Agent 0 (Value: 74)
- **Item 8 (Value Highest for Agent 1)**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Value: 90)
- **Item 2 (Value Highest for Agent 0)**: Allocate to Agent 0 (Value: 67)
- **Item 3 (Value Highest for Agent 1)**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Value: 60)
- **Item 7 (Value Highest for Agent 2)**: Allocate to Agent 2 (Value: 59)
- **Item 0 (Value Highest for Agent 2)**: Allocate to Agent 2 (Value: 9)

3. **Final Allocation**: Ensure all items are distributed and check the fairness.

Based on this allocation, the agents receive the following items:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 5, 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 8, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 7, 0

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 2],
    "1": [6, 8, 3],
    "2": [1, 7, 0]
}
```
