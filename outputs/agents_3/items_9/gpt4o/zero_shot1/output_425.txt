Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  82  36  15  82  58  65  64  30
1  45  28   5  36   2  40  73  21   1
2  31  99  50  37   2  63  88  72  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 99 50 37  2 63 88 72 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items with values that are as close as possible to each other. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, we will allocate 3 items to each agent. 

Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items as fairly as possible:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High-value items for Agent 0: 0 (99), 1 (82), 4 (82).
   - Allocation: [0, 1, 4]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High-value items for Agent 1: 6 (73), 5 (40), 3 (36).
   - Allocation: [6, 5, 3]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High-value items for Agent 2: 1 (99), 6 (88), 5 (63).
   - However, we need to adjust based on remaining items and fairness.
   - Allocation: [2, 7, 8]

These allocations ensure that each agent receives 3 items in a way that aims to maximize their individual satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [6, 5, 3],
    "2": [2, 7, 8]
}
```
