Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  15  80  34  45  99  71  30   3
1  52  50  13  41  59   9  69  81  87
2   9  30  12  79  80  32  79  40  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of items based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the 9 items among the 3 agents in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible.

Let's start by analyzing the table of valuations and then determine a fair allocation:

### Step 1: Analyze Valuations

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 7, 8, and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.

### Step 2: Allocate Items

We'll aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least some items.

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0, 2, and 5 (high valuations: 65, 80, 99).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 7, 8, and 4 (high valuations: 81, 87, 59).
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1, 3, and 6 (valuations: 30, 79, 79).

### Step 3: Verify Allocation

- All 9 items are allocated.
- Each agent receives exactly 3 items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [7, 8, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their preferences from the given valuations.
