Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94   6   5  37  97  26  14  16  60
1   1  74  58  21  64  31   0  54   1
2  75  92  27   2  19  39  11  21  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their assigned items. This approach will help ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and valuations of the items.

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (97), Item 0 (94), Item 8 (60)

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (74), Item 2 (58), Item 4 (64)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (92), Item 0 (75), Item 8 (74)

**Allocation Plan:**
- **Agent 0** should get Item 4 and Item 0, as these are the highest valued for them that Agent 1 and Agent 2 can still have high-value items.
- **Agent 1** should get Item 2 and Item 5, as it gives a good valuation to her while leaving room for Agent 2 to also get high-value items.
- **Agent 2** should get Item 1 and Item 8. 

Now, distribute the remaining items:
- **Agent 0** can take Item 7 and Item 3 to balance the allocation and increase their total value without heavily interfering with other agents.
- **Agent 1** can take Item 6 to complete the allocation without reducing the total satisfaction significantly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items while maximizing their total perceived value based on their preferences.
