Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  64   8  94  15  82  75  31  17
1  17  42  75  90  40  53  51  84  20
2  28  76  94  72   0  97  59  60  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a balanced approach to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. 

Letâ€™s evaluate the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable portion of their high-valued items. Below is a suggested allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations for items: 3 (94), 5 (82), 6 (75)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations for items: 3 (90), 2 (75), 7 (84)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations for items: 5 (97), 2 (94), 1 (76)

Considering these preferences, we will try to allocate the items while ensuring each agent gets a fair distribution of high-valued items:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 highly values it and Agent 2 already has item 5.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation and Agent 1 has fewer high-value items allocated so far.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest value after the already allocated items.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, since they have relatively high valuation for it compared to other low-value items.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as it's one of their top-valued items.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it balances their total valuation.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 2, as it completes their allocations with a reasonable valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of their high-value items while distributing all 9 items.
