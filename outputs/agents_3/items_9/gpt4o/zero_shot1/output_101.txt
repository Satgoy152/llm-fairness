Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  52  94  20  33  46  37  60  83
1  74  30  92  57   1  62  11   6  88
2  76  78  84  75  11  60  62  73  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their overall valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 2 (94), 8 (83), and 7 (60). Allocating these items will maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 0 (74), 2 (92), and 8 (88) highly. However, items 2 and 8 are already allocated to Agent 0. Therefore, allocate items 0, 3 (57), and 5 (62) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 (78), 2 (84), and 3 (75). However, items 2 and 3 are already allocated. Allocate items 1 and 6 (62) to Agent 2.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while respecting their valuations as much as possible.
