Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  77  23  68  94  94  88  68  56
1  80  42  35  25  11  98  24  15  84
2   0  34  13  57  85  64  71   0  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List all the items with their valuations for each agent:**

   - **Agent 0:** 
     - Item 0: 59
     - Item 1: 77
     - Item 2: 23
     - Item 3: 68
     - Item 4: 94
     - Item 5: 94
     - Item 6: 88
     - Item 7: 68
     - Item 8: 56

   - **Agent 1:** 
     - Item 0: 80
     - Item 1: 42
     - Item 2: 35
     - Item 3: 25
     - Item 4: 11
     - Item 5: 98
     - Item 6: 24
     - Item 7: 15
     - Item 8: 84

   - **Agent 2:** 
     - Item 0: 0
     - Item 1: 34
     - Item 2: 13
     - Item 3: 57
     - Item 4: 85
     - Item 5: 64
     - Item 6: 71
     - Item 7: 0
     - Item 8: 15

2. **Assign items to the agent who values it the most:**

   - **Item 0:** Agent 1 (80)
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 (77)
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 (23)
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 (68)
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 (94)
   - **Item 5:** Agent 1 (98)
   - **Item 6:** Agent 0 (88)
   - **Item 7:** Agent 0 (68)
   - **Item 8:** Agent 1 (84)

3. **Check if the allocation is fair and adjust if necessary:**  
   Given the above allocations, Agent 0 receives 6 items, Agent 1 receives 3 items, and Agent 2 receives no items. Itâ€™s necessary to ensure that each agent gets at least some items if possible. We can adjust the allocations to ensure fairness while considering the valuations.

4. **Final fair allocation:**
   - Allocate items considering a balance between maximizing individual agent valuations and fairness.

Here's a fair allocation ensuring all agents get items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 8],
    "2": [6, 7]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 3, 4] which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 5, 8] which they value the most.
- Agent 2 receives items [6, 7] which they value more than some other allocations.
