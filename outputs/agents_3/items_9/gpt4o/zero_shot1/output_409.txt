Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  25  33  76  91  99  44  77  84
1  42  72  99  53  58  26  36   0  42
2  52   8  11  40  70  45  64  69   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated in total. We'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives, based on their individual valuations of the items.

First, let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [68, 25, 33, 76, 91, 99, 44, 77, 84]
- Agent 1: [42, 72, 99, 53, 58, 26, 36, 0, 42]
- Agent 2: [52, 8, 11, 40, 70, 45, 64, 69, 9]

Given these valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is somewhat balanced. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items primarily based on each agent's highest valuations.
2. Ensure all 9 items are distributed.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Based on these criteria, the allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5] - Total value: 68 + 76 + 99 = 243
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 8] - Total value: 99 + 58 + 42 = 199
- Agent 2: [1, 6, 7] - Total value: 8 + 64 + 69 = 141

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent receives 3 items.
- The items are distributed fairly based on the agents' highest valuations for the items they receive.
- All 9 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
