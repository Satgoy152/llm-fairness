Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  34  56  91   8  45  23  57  16
1  80  86  89  69  31  55  97  22  24
2  43  46  48  43  69  70  70  71  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 34 56 91  8 45 23 57 16]
 [80 86 89 69 31 55 97 22 24]
 [43 46 48 43 69 70 70 71 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We should also ensure that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6.
3. Agent 2 has moderate valuations for items 5, 6, and 7.

By analyzing the table, I will allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, and 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, and 6
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5, and 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 8]
}
```
