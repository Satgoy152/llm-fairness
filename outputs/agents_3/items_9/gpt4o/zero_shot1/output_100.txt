Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  88  75  19  92   3  63   5  63
1  79   5  21  16  69  37  57  97  74
2  45  72  75  18   7  32  64  93   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**  
   0: 17, 1: 88, 2: 75, 3: 19, 4: 92, 5: 3, 6: 63, 7: 5, 8: 63

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**  
   0: 79, 1: 5, 2: 21, 3: 16, 4: 69, 5: 37, 6: 57, 7: 97, 8: 74

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**  
   0: 45, 1: 72, 2: 75, 3: 18, 4: 7, 5: 32, 6: 64, 7: 93, 8: 0

**Allocating Items:**

- **Agent 0:** The highest-valued items for Agent 0 are items 4 (92) and 1 (88). We allocate these two items to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:** The highest-valued items for Agent 1 are items 7 (97) and 0 (79). We allocate these two items to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2:** The highest-valued items for Agent 2 are items 7 (93) and 2 (75). However, item 7 is already allocated to Agent 1. Therefore, we allocate items 2 (75) and 1 (72) to Agent 2.

At this point, each agent has been assigned two items. We have allocated 6 items in total (2 items for each agent). We need to allocate the remaining 3 items in a way that maintains fairness.

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it has a relatively higher value for them (19) compared to other agents.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as it provides reasonable value (32) and is not a high-priority item for other agents.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1, as it has a reasonable valuation for them (74).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets exactly 3 items, and we have distributed all 9 items among the agents.
