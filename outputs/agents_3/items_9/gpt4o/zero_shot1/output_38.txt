Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  25  98  15  70  32  17  33   6
1  32  72   9  53  47  53  73  82  50
2  12  74  60  34  24  35  33  19  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 25 98 15 70 32 17 33  6]
 [32 72  9 53 47 53 73 82 50]
 [12 74 60 34 24 35 33 19 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent 0: [86, 25, 98, 15, 70, 32, 17, 33, 6]
Agent 1: [32, 72, 9, 53, 47, 53, 73, 82, 50]
Agent 2: [12, 74, 60, 34, 24, 35, 33, 19, 94]
```

A possible strategy is to assign each item to the agent that values it most, while balancing the total number of items each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest (86).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest (74).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest (98).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest (53).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest (70).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest (53).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest (73).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the highest (82).
9. **Item 8**: Agent 2 values it the highest (94).

Now, checking the allocation:
- Agent 0: 3 items (0, 2, 4)
- Agent 1: 4 items (3, 5, 6, 7)
- Agent 2: 2 items (1, 8)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 8]
}
```
