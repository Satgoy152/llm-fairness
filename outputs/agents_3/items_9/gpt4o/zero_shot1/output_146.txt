Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  69  74  36  92  28  58  95  79
1  67  58  53  26  98  37  12  43  99
2  12  62  38   7  72   3  21  37  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [12 62 38  7 72  3 21 37 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring that each agent receives a similar number of items. Given there are three agents and nine items, each agent should ideally receive three items. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items: 7 (95), 4 (92), 2 (74)
   - Allocate items 7, 4, and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value items: 8 (99), 4 (98), 0 (67)
   - Allocate items 8, 1, and 0 to Agent 1. Note that item 4 cannot be given to Agent 1 as it is already allocated to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value items: 4 (72), 1 (62), 8 (51)
   - Allocate items 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 2. Note that item 4 cannot be given to Agent 2 as it is already allocated, and item 1 is also already allocated to Agent 1.

The allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
