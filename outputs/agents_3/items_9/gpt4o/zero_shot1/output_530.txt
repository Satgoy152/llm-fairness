Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  95  91  93  44  83  51  63  47
1  58  88  55  79  57  39  32   0  75
2  63  21  70  19  20  64  50  80  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. We have 9 items and 3 agents, so ideally, each agent should receive 3 items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 3 (93), Item 2 (91)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (88), Item 3 (79), Item 8 (75)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (80), Item 8 (71), Item 2 (70)

Based on these observations, we should allocate the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets 3 items:

### Initial Allocation Consideration:
- Agent 0 wants items 1, 3, and 2.
- Agent 1 wants items 1 and 3, which overlaps with Agent 0's preference.
- Agent 2 wants items 7, 8, and 2, where item 2 overlaps with Agent 0.

### Fair Allocation:
Let's resolve the overlaps by allocating the items such that the total valuation is maximized for all agents:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4, 8
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items and considers their highest valuations with minimal conflicts.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
