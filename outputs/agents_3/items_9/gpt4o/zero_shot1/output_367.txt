Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  77  25  49  78   0  81  27  96
1  45  90  21  46  39  72  13  65  29
2  17  23  72   9   3  94  88  13  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a simple method to ensure that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is approximately balanced. We aim to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a manner that balances the total value received by each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0 are 8 (96), 6 (81), 4 (78), 1 (77), and 0 (57).
   - Allocate items that maximize their satisfaction while considering other agents.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1 are 1 (90), 5 (72), 3 (46), and 7 (65).
   - Allocate items that maximize their satisfaction while considering other agents.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2 are 5 (94), 6 (88), and 2 (72).
   - Allocate items that maximize their satisfaction while considering other agents.

Considering the above and balancing among agents, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 8]
  - Total valuation: 57 (item 0) + 96 (item 8) = 153

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [1, 3, 7]
  - Total valuation: 90 (item 1) + 46 (item 3) + 65 (item 7) = 201

- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [2, 4, 5, 6]
  - Total valuation: 72 (item 2) + 3 (item 4) + 94 (item 5) + 88 (item 6) = 257

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations received by each agent, given their preferences as specified in the table.
