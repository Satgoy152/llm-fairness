Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  69  48  74  32  69  27  48  23
1  51  91  89  67  62  88   3   4  91
2  92  65  28  93  74  80  61  76  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent seems to have relatively high values for items 1 and 3 compared to others. 
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 1, 2, 5, and 8. However, since item 1 is more valuable to Agent 2, we should prioritize the remaining high-value items.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest values for items 0 and 3, and also values item 4 and 7 highly. 

With these considerations, we can make the following allocation:

- Assign items 3 and 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2, 5, and 8 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0, 1, 4, and 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation respects the need for each agent to receive items based on their valuations and ensures all items are distributed. 

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```
