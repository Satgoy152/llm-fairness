Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  91  66  80  12  20  12  81  11
1  85  98  44  69  10  50  25   3  38
2  63  90  74  31  65   8   7  15  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, let's aim for a balanced approach where each agent receives items according to their highest preferences. We should ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [1, 91, 66, 80, 12, 20, 12, 81, 11]
- Agent 1: [85, 98, 44, 69, 10, 50, 25, 3, 38]
- Agent 2: [63, 90, 74, 31, 65, 8, 7, 15, 42]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Allocation strategy:
- Agent 0 has high value for items 1, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high value for items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 2 has high value for items 2, 4, and 8.

Let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 1, but Agent 0 also values it highly).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (third highest for Agent 0).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (next high value for Agent 1).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (next high value for Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (next high value for Agent 2).
9. Allocate item 8 to Agent 2 (next high value for Agent 2).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 8]
}
```
