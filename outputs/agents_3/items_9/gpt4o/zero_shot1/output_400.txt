Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  33   2  19  93  99  82  29  49
1  30  87  91  74  52  50   4  40  64
2  26  53  11  49  75  79  13  53  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We have 9 items to allocate among 3 agents, which means each agent should receive approximately 3 items.

Let's proceed by evaluating which items each agent values the most and try to assign items accordingly while maintaining fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations are for items: 5 (99), 4 (93), and 0 (92).
   - Assign items 5, 4, and 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After removing items assigned to Agent 0, highest valuations are for items: 2 (91), 1 (87), and 3 (74).
   - Assign items 2, 1, and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items are 6, 7, 8.
   - Assign items 6, 7, and 8 to Agent 2 as they are the only remaining items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and the items are fairly distributed based on their preferences.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
