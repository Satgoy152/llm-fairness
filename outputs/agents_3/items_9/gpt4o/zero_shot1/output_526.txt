Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  27  65  56  74  43  83  99  93
1  76  26  63  45  70  39  14  36  78
2   1  60   9  23  49  96  10  80  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share close to one-third of the total value, since there are three agents and nine items.

Here are the steps taken to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Values for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 Total Value: 81 + 27 + 65 + 56 + 74 + 43 + 83 + 99 + 93 = 621
   - Agent 1 Total Value: 76 + 26 + 63 + 45 + 70 + 39 + 14 + 36 + 78 = 447
   - Agent 2 Total Value: 1 + 60 + 9 + 23 + 49 + 96 + 10 + 80 + 96 = 424

2. **Calculate Fair Share for Each Agent:**
   - Fair Share (per agent) = Total Sum of Values / 3 = (621 + 447 + 424) / 3 = 497.33 (approximately)

3. **Allocate Items to Each Agent:**
   - Assign items to each agent so that their total value is as close as possible to the fair share.

**Allocation Process:**

- **Agent 0:** 
  1. Item 7 (99)
  2. Item 8 (93)
  3. Item 6 (83)
  - Total Value = 99 + 93 + 83 = 275

- **Agent 1:**
  1. Item 0 (76)
  2. Item 4 (70)
  3. Item 3 (45)
  4. Item 8 (78)
  - Total Value = 76 + 70 + 45 + 78 = 269

- **Agent 2:**
  1. Item 5 (96)
  2. Item 1 (60)
  3. Item 7 (80)
  - Total Value = 96 + 60 + 80 = 236

**Final Allocation:**
- Please ensure each agent receives an equal number of items, which means each should receive three items based on the problem's constraints.

Here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and the items chosen provide a relatively balanced distribution of values according to the original matrix.
