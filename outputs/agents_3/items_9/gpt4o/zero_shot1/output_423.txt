Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  81  60  75   8  12   3  15  47
1  80  43  14  21   7  55  17  92  89
2  58  89  83  59  79  15  32   9  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 89 83 59 79 15 32  9 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that have relatively high valuations unique to Agent 0 compared to the others.
   - Possible high-value items for Agent 0: Item 0 (51), Item 1 (81), Item 3 (75).
   
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that have relatively high valuations unique to Agent 1 compared to the others.
   - Possible high-value items for Agent 1: Item 7 (92), Item 8 (89), Item 5 (55).

3. **Agent 2**: Assign items that have relatively high valuations unique to Agent 2 compared to the others.
   - Possible high-value items for Agent 2: Item 2 (83), Item 4 (79), Item 6 (32).

Ensure that each item is only allocated once and that the total number of allocated items is 9.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: [7, 8, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 4, 6]

Allocations in JSON format:

{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [7, 8, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
