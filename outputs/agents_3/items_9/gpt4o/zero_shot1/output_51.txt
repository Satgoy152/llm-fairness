Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88   8  41  17  13   2  72  38  37
1  46  99  63  43  37  75  98  58  31
2  75  31  36  43  79  88  41  53  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable number of items. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least some items if possible.

Let's examine the valuations and assign the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 46, Agent 2 at 75. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 at 99, Agent 2 at 31. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 63, Agent 2 at 36. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 17, Agent 1 at 43, Agent 2 at 43. Assign to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 already has more items to balance, we can give it to Agent 2 for fairness).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 at 37, Agent 2 at 79. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 75, Agent 2 at 88. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 at 98, Agent 2 at 41. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 58, Agent 2 at 53. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 at 31, Agent 2 at 98. Assign to Agent 2.

Now, let's check the distribution:
- Agent 0: Items 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 5, 8

Each agent should have received an equal number of items or as close as possible. However, given the constraints, this is the optimal distribution based on the highest valuations while balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most highly, while trying to maintain a fair distribution of items among the agents.
