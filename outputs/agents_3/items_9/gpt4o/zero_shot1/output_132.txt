Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96   9  43   3  62  81  76  99  60
1  88   9  26  40  93  15  12  83   3
2  89  56  49  67  39   4  69  67  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would receive for each possible allocation.
2. Allocate items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure that each agent receives a total of 3 items, given there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - Agent 2 values it at 89.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 9.
   - Agent 1 values it at 9.
   - Agent 2 values it at 56.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 43.
   - Agent 1 values it at 26.
   - Agent 2 values it at 49.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 3.
   - Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - Agent 2 values it at 67.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 62.
   - Agent 1 values it at 93.
   - Agent 2 values it at 39.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81.
   - Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Agent 2 values it at 4.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Agent 2 values it at 69.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99.
   - Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - Agent 2 values it at 67.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 60.
   - Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Agent 2 values it at 99.
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, we ensure that each agent receives only 3 items, and adjust the allocations if needed to maintain fairness and balance. Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 8]
}
```

Upon reviewing the allocation, we need to balance the items so each agent gets exactly 3 items. Since Agent 1 has only 2 items and Agent 2 has 4, we can transfer an item from Agent 2 to Agent 1:

- Transfer Item 3 from Agent 2 to Agent 1.

Final balanced allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 8]
}
```
