Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  15  42  82   7  87  53  60  60
1  10  48   0  10  71   0  63  62   3
2  29  81   3  13   3  63  18  51  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 15 42 82  7 87 53 60 60]
 [10 48  0 10 71  0 63 62  3]
 [29 81  3 13  3 63 18 51 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [44, 15, 42, 82, 7, 87, 53, 60, 60]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [10, 48, 0, 10, 71, 0, 63, 62, 3]
- Agent 2 values the items as follows: [29, 81, 3, 13, 3, 63, 18, 51, 61]

A possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Item 0: Max value is 44 by Agent 0
2. Item 1: Max value is 81 by Agent 2
3. Item 2: Max value is 42 by Agent 0
4. Item 3: Max value is 82 by Agent 0
5. Item 4: Max value is 71 by Agent 1
6. Item 5: Max value is 87 by Agent 0
7. Item 6: Max value is 63 by Agent 1
8. Item 7: Max value is 62 by Agent 1
9. Item 8: Max value is 61 by Agent 2

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [4, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. The total number of items allocated is 9, which satisfies the requirement.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 8]
}
```
