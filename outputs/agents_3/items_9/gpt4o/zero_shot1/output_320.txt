Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  35  28  27   1  65  86  85  77
1  70  51   7  55  56   0   0  59  45
2  50  99  94  97  25  40  45  68  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We also need to ensure that each item is only allocated once and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Highest: 92 (item 0), 86 (item 6), 85 (item 7), 77 (item 8)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Highest: 70 (item 0), 59 (item 7), 56 (item 4), 55 (item 3)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Highest: 99 (item 1), 97 (item 3), 94 (item 2), 68 (item 7)

Based on the valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (92), Item 6 (86)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (55), Item 4 (56), Item 8 (45)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (99), Item 2 (94), Item 5 (40), Item 7 (68)

Now, let's ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 8
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 5, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```
