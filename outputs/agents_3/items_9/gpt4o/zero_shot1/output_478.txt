Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  60   9  63  11  59  37  39  64
1  82  31  83  66  93  52  45  82  14
2  79   7   8   4  60  43  76  83  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79  7  8  4 60 43 76 83 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use an approach that seeks to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (because there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items, but we can adjust slightly if needed). 

We start by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. 

Here's one possible way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (92), 3 (63), and 8 (64).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 (93), 2 (83), and 7 (82).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 7 (83), 6 (76), and 8 (70).

Given these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 8 to Agent 0. 
- Assign items 4, 2, and 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 7, 6, and 5 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly and each agent receives 3 items. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [4, 2, 1],
    "2": [7, 6, 5]
}
```
