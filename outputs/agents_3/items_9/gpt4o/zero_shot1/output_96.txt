Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  94  22  10  19  62  33  26  46
1  96  57   7   0   0   1   7  93  66
2  74  26  43  54  75  93  45  73  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 26 43 54 75 93 45 73 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use a method that balances the total value received by each agent as equally as possible, given their individual valuations for each item. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for item 1 (94) and item 5 (62).
   - Moderate valuation for item 8 (46).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation for item 0 (96) and item 7 (93).
   - Moderate valuation for item 8 (66).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation for item 5 (93) and item 8 (87).
   - Moderate valuation for item 4 (75) and item 7 (73).

Given these observations, we can attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 1 (94), 5 (62), 8 (46)
  - Total valuation: 94 + 62 + 46 = 202

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 0 (96), 7 (93)
  - Total valuation: 96 + 93 = 189

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items: 2 (43), 3 (54), 4 (75), 6 (45)
  - Total valuation: 43 + 54 + 75 + 45 = 217

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The allocation format in JSON is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
