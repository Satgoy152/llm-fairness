Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  47  89  47  32  24  93  57  25
1  42  49  55  22  59  44  44  11  96
2   8  61  34  33  65  81  68  55  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here's a process to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** Check the sum of valuations each agent gives to all items. This helps understand how much each agent values the items overall, but will not be directly used for allocation.

2. **Assign Items:** Distribute the items among the agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

3. **Ensure Equal Number of Items:** Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should get 3 items. If the valuation is close and fair, we can proceed with this division.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0:** High valuation on items 0, 2, and 6
- **Agent 1:** High valuation on items 8, 4, and 1
- **Agent 2:** High valuation on items 5, 7, and 3

Thus, the allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [8, 4, 1],
    "2": [5, 7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and the distribution of items is based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while keeping the distribution fair.
