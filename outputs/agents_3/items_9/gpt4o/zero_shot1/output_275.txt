Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  74  81  92   1  92  33  83  93
1  57  41  64  21  58  99  27  58  93
2  27  66  46  52  78  95  73   5  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuations, one approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 70.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 78.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.
9. **Item 8**: Both Agents 0 and 1 value it equally at 93. To balance allocations, assign it to Agent 1.

Now let's allocate these items accordingly:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [5, 8]
- Agent 2 receives items [4, 6]

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
