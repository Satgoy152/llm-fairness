Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59   5  62  11  72  33  85  85   6
1  33  29  49   2  43  38  97  70  59
2  93  75  88  26  31  18  64  25  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a heuristic approach, considering each agent's highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (85), Item 7 (85), Item 4 (72)
   - Allocate items: 6, 7, 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 7 (70), Item 8 (59)
   - Allocate items: 1, 8

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 2 (88), Item 8 (84)
   - Allocate items: 0, 2, 3, 5

Let's ensure each agent has at least one item and the total count of allocated items is exactly 9.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with a focus on maximizing each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
