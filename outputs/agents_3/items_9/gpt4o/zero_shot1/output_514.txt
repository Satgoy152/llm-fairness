Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  84  60  41  60  39  79  99  34
1  69  37  62  30  69  78  85  44  19
2  99  50  24  45  27  18  52  29  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for items 0 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has higher values for items 5 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest, but since Agent 0 also values it highly, we can allocate some different high-value items for Agent 2.

Let's try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 7, and 4. These items have relatively high values for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 5, 6, and 3. These items have high values for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1, 2, and 8. These items provide a good value for Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair portion of their high-value items, and all items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 8]
}
```
