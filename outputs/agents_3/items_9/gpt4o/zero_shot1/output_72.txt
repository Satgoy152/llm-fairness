Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  43  96  70  35  23  52  96  90
1  40  66  52  12  43  11  87  12  81
2  66  80  99  42  24  95  91  45   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with high valuations for Agent 0. The highest values for Agent 0 are items 2 (96), 7 (96), and 8 (90). Assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Consider the items with high valuations for Agent 1. The highest values for Agent 1 are items 1 (66), 6 (87), and 8 (81). Since item 8 is already allocated to Agent 0, assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with high valuations for Agent 2. The highest values for Agent 2 are items 2 (99), 1 (80), 5 (95), and 6 (91). Since items 1, 2, and 6 are already allocated, assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 2. 

4. **Re-evaluate remaining items**: At this point, items 3 and 4 are unallocated. Assign these remaining items to the agents with the next highest valuations who have fewer items.

   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 12, and Agent 2 at 42. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 at 43, and Agent 2 at 24. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has been fairly allocated items based on their valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 4, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 5, 8

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 5, 8]
}
```
