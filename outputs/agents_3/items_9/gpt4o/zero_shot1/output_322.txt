Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  33  66  72  35  30  46  20  85
1  87  91  74  42  60  94  89  57  19
2  24  25  13  63  45  58  92  24   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 33 66 72 35 30 46 20 85]
 [87 91 74 42 60 94 89 57 19]
 [24 25 13 63 45 58 92 24  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and come up with a fair distribution:

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [67, 33, 66, 72, 35, 30, 46, 20, 85]
- **Agent 1**: [87, 91, 74, 42, 60, 94, 89, 57, 19]
- **Agent 2**: [24, 25, 13, 63, 45, 58, 92, 24, 8]

### Potential Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 1** has consistently high valuations for many items, so assigning high-value items to Agent 1 might be beneficial.
- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for Item 6, so assigning Item 6 to Agent 2 could be fair.
- **Agent 0** can be assigned items that are not the highest for Agent 1 but still have some value.

### Allocation Plan:
1. Assign the highest valued items for Agent 1.
2. Assign the best remaining items for Agent 0 and Agent 2.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item and total items assigned is 9.

### Assign the Items:
- **Agent 1**: Items with the highest values for them are 1, 5, and 6.
- **Agent 0**: Next best items for them could be 0, 2, and 8.
- **Agent 2**: Assign the items that maximize their total value while completing the allocation, such as 3, 4, and 7.

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items based on the valuations given, with each agent receiving exactly 3 items and all 9 items allocated.
