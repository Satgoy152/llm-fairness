Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75   1  48  73  36   3   4  46  32
1  32  34  52  62   5  99  71   5  27
2  22  51  66   6  42  65  76  82  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step method to achieve this:

1. **Determine Total Items per Agent:** Each agent should receive an equal number of items or as close to equal as possible, given there are 9 items and 3 agents. This means ideally, each agent should receive 3 items.

2. **Sort Valuations:** For each agent, sort the items based on their valuation in descending order. This helps in identifying the most valued items for each agent.

3. **Allocate Items:** Allocate items to agents in a manner that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Agent 0
- Valuations: [75, 1, 48, 73, 36, 3, 4, 46, 32]
- Sorted by valuation: [0 (75), 3 (73), 2 (48), 7 (46), 4 (36), 8 (32), 6 (4), 5 (3), 1 (1)]

### Agent 1
- Valuations: [32, 34, 52, 62, 5, 99, 71, 5, 27]
- Sorted by valuation: [5 (99), 6 (71), 3 (62), 2 (52), 1 (34), 0 (32), 8 (27), 4 (5), 7 (5)]

### Agent 2
- Valuations: [22, 51, 66, 6, 42, 65, 76, 82, 16]
- Sorted by valuation: [7 (82), 6 (76), 2 (66), 5 (65), 1 (51), 4 (42), 0 (22), 8 (16), 3 (6)]

### Allocation Strategy
- Assign the highest valued items from each agent's sorted list, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and that we distribute the items as evenly as possible.

#### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 3, 7] (highest valued items for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Items [5, 6, 2] (highest valued items for Agent 1 not taken by Agent 0)
- **Agent 2:** Items [1, 4, 8] (remaining items)

### Final Allocation JSON
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [5, 6, 2],
    "2": [1, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and the items are distributed based on maximizing individual agent valuations as much as possible.
