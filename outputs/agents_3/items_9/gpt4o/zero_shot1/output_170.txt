Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  62  51  67  79  61  81  37  93
1  36  82  89  86  21  98  45  95  31
2  18  77  64   3  82  14  57  78  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 62 51 67 79 61 81 37 93]
 [36 82 89 86 21 98 45 95 31]
 [18 77 64  3 82 14 57 78 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution considers the valuations and results in a reasonably equitable distribution. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: 96 (item 0), 93 (item 8), 81 (item 6), 79 (item 4), 67 (item 3)
  
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: 98 (item 5), 95 (item 7), 89 (item 2), 86 (item 3), 82 (item 1)
  
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: 
   - Highest valuations: 82 (item 4), 78 (item 7), 77 (item 1), 64 (item 2), 57 (item 6)
  
Now, let's make a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Assign items 0, 6, and 8 (high value items for Agent 0).
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Assign items 5, 7, and 2 (high value items for Agent 1).
  
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Assign items 1, 3, and 4 (high value items for Agent 2).

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and the distribution is based on their highest preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [5, 7, 2],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
