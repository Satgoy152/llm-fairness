Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  17   8  72  37  24   6   6  95
1  70  78  19   8  96  86  66  58  87
2  74  48  83  12  43  63  55  65  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 48 83 12 43 63 55 65 17]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 8 (95), 3 (72), 0 (57).
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (96), 5 (86), 8 (87).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (83), 0 (74), 5 (63).

Next, let's allocate the items based on maximizing the value for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: It would be ideal to allocate item 8 (95) and item 3 (72) to Agent 0, as these are the highest value items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (96) and item 5 (86) to Agent 1, as these are the highest value items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (83) and possibly item 0 (74) to Agent 2, as these are high value items for Agent 2.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (17) to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (58) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (55) to Agent 2.

This results in each agent receiving an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3, 1],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 0, 6]
}
```
