Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  45  22   5  66  10  91  63  76
1  50  89  62  13  50  22  20  62  12
2  15   4   7  53  12  60  49  89  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item and try to distribute items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. One common approach is to ensure that each agent gets approximately an equal number of items. Since we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (91), Item 8 (76), Item 4 (66)
   - Allocate: Items 6, 8, 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (89), Item 2 (62), Item 7 (62)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 2, 7

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (89), Item 5 (60), Item 3 (53)
   - Allocate: Items 5, 3, 0

However, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share without conflicts. Let's adjust based on overlaps and try to maintain fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 8, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 5

After considering the overlaps and ensuring each agent gets an equal number of items, here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and no item is assigned to more than one agent.
