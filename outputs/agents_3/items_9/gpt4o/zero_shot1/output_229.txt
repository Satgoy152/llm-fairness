Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  68  69   4  85  10  85   2  64
1  63  17  52   1  52  97  47   2   6
2  91  96  75  17  30  50  70  52   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: [32, 68, 69, 4, 85, 10, 85, 2, 64]
   - Agent 1: [63, 17, 52, 1, 52, 97, 47, 2, 6]
   - Agent 2: [91, 96, 75, 17, 30, 50, 70, 52, 3]

2. **Assign Items Greedily**: 
   - Start by assigning each agent their most valued items first to maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Item 4 (85)
     - Item 6 (85)
     - Item 2 (69)
   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Item 5 (97)
     - Item 0 (63)
   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Item 1 (96)
     - Item 7 (52)
     - Item 3 (17)
     - Item 8 (3)

4. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**:
   - Verify that all 9 items have been allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 2],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [1, 7, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed among the agents.
