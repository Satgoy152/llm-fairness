Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  71  73  16  64  26  20  85  61
1  64  31  59  36  27  24  24  34  34
2  97  99  37  23  11  40  76  24  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 31 59 36 27 24 24 34 34]
 [97 99 37 23 11 40 76 24 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. One common approach is to use a maximization strategy where we try to allocate items to agents such that their total valuation is maximized while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll proceed with this approach.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Allocate items based on highest valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - If a tie occurs, we can use arbitrary assignment, as long as the total allocation is fair (each agent gets an integer number of items).

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6, 8]

**Justification:**

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (97), but Agent 0 already has item 0.
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (99), but Agent 0 already has item 1.
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (73), but assigned to Agent 1 based on overall fairness.
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (36).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (64), but assigned to Agent 1 based on overall fairness.
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (40).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (76).
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (85).
- Item 8: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (61), but assigned to Agent 2 based on overall fairness.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items (3 items each), and the allocation is balanced in terms of total valuations.
