Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  28  92   6  54  56  20  36  83
1  46  98  35  88  89  93  19   4  71
2  54  33  16   6  11   4  20  46  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 4 28 92  6 54 56 20 36 83]
 [46 98 35 88 89 93 19  4 71]
 [54 33 16  6 11  4 20 46 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations.

Let's analyze the table and start by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Initial Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (92) and 8 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (98) and 5 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (54) and 7 (46).

### Assigning Remaining Items:
- Assign the remaining items based on the next highest valuations that haven't been assigned yet, trying to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

### Allocation Process:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 2 (92)
  - Item 8 (83)
  - Item 6 (20) – Next highest available valuation for Agent 0

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1 (98)
  - Item 5 (93)
  - Item 3 (88) – Next highest available valuation for Agent 1

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 0 (54)
  - Item 7 (46)
  - Item 4 (11) – Next highest available valuation for Agent 2

### Final Allocations:
Now, each agent has 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 3],
    "2": [0, 7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the allocations are based on their valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
