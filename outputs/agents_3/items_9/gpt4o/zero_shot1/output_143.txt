Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27   8  36  95  28  44  90  52  19
1  50  68  47  23  90  62  97  13  64
2  87  94  95  98  82  85  61   2   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [50 68 47 23 90 62 97 13 64]
 [87 94 95 98 82 85 61  2  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the preferences and values each agent places on the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction or utility across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highest at 3 (95), 6 (90), 2 (36), 5 (44).
- Agent 1 values items highest at 6 (97), 4 (90), 1 (68), 8 (64).
- Agent 2 values items highest at 3 (98), 2 (95), 1 (94).

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 98).
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 97).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation of 90).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation of 94).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (third highest valuation of 87).
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (third highest valuation of 36).
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (fourth highest valuation of 44).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (fifth highest valuation of 52).
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (valuation of 64).

With this allocation, we ensure that each agent has received a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
