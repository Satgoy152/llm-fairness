Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  49   2  66  35  19   6  95  56
1  96  28  95  96  34  72  29  11  90
2  98  51  75  44  27  20  33  24  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 51 75 44 27 20 33 24 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This can be achieved by assigning items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's top valued items: 7 (95), 3 (66), 8 (56)
- Agent 1's top valued items: 0 (96), 3 (96), 2 (95)
- Agent 2's top valued items: 0 (98), 1 (51), 2 (75)

To ensure fairness and maximize valuations:
1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0, who values it at 95.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, who values it at 98 (slightly higher than Agent 1).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, who values it at 95.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, who values it at 96.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, who values it at 51.
6. Assign item 8 to Agent 0, who values it at 56.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, who values it at 72.
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, who values it at 35.
9. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, who values it at 33.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are fairly distributed based on valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
