Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  59  59  34  30  25  58  55  39
1  18  77  52  43  90   5  46  85  23
2  40  55   7  43   8  50  55   7  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 3 items.

We will allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Select the highest valued items for Agent 0.
   - Items 1 and 2 both have a value of 59 for Agent 0.
   - Item 6 has a value of 58 for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Select the highest valued items for Agent 1.
   - Item 4 has the highest value of 90 for Agent 1.
   - Item 1 has the next highest value of 77 for Agent 1.
   - Item 7 has a value of 85 for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Select the highest valued items for Agent 2.
   - Item 0 has a value of 40 for Agent 2.
   - Item 3 has a value of 43 for Agent 2.
   - Item 5 has a value of 50 for Agent 2.

Let's list the items allocated to each agent:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: [4, 7, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 3, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
