Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  61   0  46  81   7  36  93  71
1   1  99  98  88  65  24  84  61  68
2  53  63  38  27  49  37  37  13   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents to maximize their total value received.

Here is an allocation that attempts to balance these criteria:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 1, 4, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 2 has moderate values across several items but none exceptionally high.

Let's allocate based on the highest values each agent has for the items:

- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it at 99.
- Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it at 98.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they also value it highly at 88.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0, as they value it at 81.
- Assign item 7 to agent 0, as they value it at 93.
- Assign item 0 to agent 2, as they value it at 53.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they value it at 37.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1, as they value it at 84.
- Assign item 8 to agent 0, as they value it at 71.

This ensures each agent gets items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 5]
}
```
