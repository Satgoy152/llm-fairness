Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  74  91  48  51  62  53  94  45
1  60  94  14  46  32  55  37  14  33
2  86  24  27  67  56  74  72  50   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that tries to maximize the total utility for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing individual agent's gains while keeping track of overall fairness.

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 71 + 74 + 91 + 48 + 51 + 62 + 53 + 94 + 45 = 589
- Agent 1: 60 + 94 + 14 + 46 + 32 + 55 + 37 + 14 + 33 = 385
- Agent 2: 86 + 24 + 27 + 67 + 56 + 74 + 72 + 50 + 3 = 459

Next, we will allocate items in a way that tries to maximize the value each agent receives:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 91)
2. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 94)
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 71)
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 94)
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value = 74)
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value = 72)
7. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value = 67)
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 51)
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value = 33)

This allocation strategy gives each agent items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 0, 4],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 3]
}
```
