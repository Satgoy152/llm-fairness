Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  75  40  21  30  21  59  98  64
1  90  21  43  40  14  98  68  86  95
2   6  68  18  49  16  22  78  67  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. An approach we can take is to maximize each agent's total valuation by strategically assigning items. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it highest at 90.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it highest at 75.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 43.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 49.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 30.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest at 98.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it highest at 78.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values it highest at 98.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it highest at 95.

2. **Initial allocation based on the highest values:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5, 8
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 6

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items based on their valuations and ensures a good distribution of total value. However, let's review the allocation to see if we can improve or balance the allocation more:

- Agent 0 receives items with values: 75, 30, 98
- Agent 1 receives items with values: 90, 43, 98, 95
- Agent 2 receives items with values: 49, 78

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 8],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items and all items are allocated. Each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a balanced distribution.
