Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  24  13  91  17  94  14  61  85
1  95  13  99  57   9   3  12  42  34
2  36  72  79  99  10  49  38   2  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to maximize their total satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one potential approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 5 (94), and Item 8 (85).

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 2 (99), and Item 7 (42).

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (72), Item 6 (38), and Item 4 (10).

Let's verify that this allocation is fair in terms of each agent receiving items they value highly:

- Agent 0 gets items 3, 5, and 8, which are among their highest valuations.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, and 7, which are among their highest valuations.
- Agent 2 gets items 1, 6, and 4, which they value relatively highly compared to other agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [1, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and all items are distributed among the agents.
