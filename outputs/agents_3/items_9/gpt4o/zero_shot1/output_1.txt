Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  57  65  80  43  62  51  74  25
1  85  20  85  16  92  99  57  18  22
2  78  72  98  48  99   0  80   0  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use a method such as the "maximum sum allocation," which tries to maximize the total valuation of items assigned to each agent. Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Items with high values are 3 (80), 2 (65), 7 (74)
   - Agent 1: Items with high values are 5 (99), 4 (92), 0 (85)
   - Agent 2: Items with high values are 4 (99), 2 (98), 0 (78)

2. **Allocate items considering each agentâ€™s highest preferences while trying to ensure fairness**:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value 99)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value 92)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value 98)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value 80)
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (next highest value 74)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value 85)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest value 80)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value 72)
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (next highest value 25)

3. **Review allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 7, 8
   - Agent 1: Items 5, 4, 0
   - Agent 2: Items 2, 6, 1

4. **Check the allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, and agents have integer amounts**:
   - Total items allocated = 3 (Agent 0) + 3 (Agent 1) + 3 (Agent 2) = 9

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 4, 0],
    "2": [2, 6, 1]
}
```
