Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  99  15  17  62  84  41  84  78
1  28  33  16  40  44   5  18  31  13
2  64  26  77  65  29  20  42  50   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

Agent 0: 81 + 99 + 15 + 17 + 62 + 84 + 41 + 84 + 78 = 561  
Agent 1: 28 + 33 + 16 + 40 + 44 + 5 + 18 + 31 + 13 = 228  
Agent 2: 64 + 26 + 77 + 65 + 29 + 20 + 42 + 50 + 0 = 373  

2. Allocate items to maximize total valuations for each agent, keeping fairness in mind. One way to achieve a fair allocation is to consider each agent's preferences and ensure that each agent receives items they highly value.

A possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
- Agent 1: Allocate items that are still available and are of significant value to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate items that are left and are of significant value to Agent 2.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 5] (Total valuation: 81 + 99 + 84 = 264)
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 7] (Total valuation: 40 + 44 + 31 = 115)
- Agent 2: [2, 6, 8] (Total valuation: 77 + 42 + 0 = 119)

This allocation ensures each agent gets exactly 3 items and maximizes their respective valuations based on the table provided.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 6, 8]
}
```
