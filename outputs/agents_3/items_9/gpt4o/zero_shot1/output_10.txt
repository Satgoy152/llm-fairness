Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  50  53  34  97  94  30  57  95
1  64  45  47  41  72  51  83   1  52
2  91  84  45  43  44  69  65  68  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to provide an equitable distribution based on the valuations given, ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal value from the items they receive. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with high values for Agent 0 are 4 (97), 8 (95), and 2 (53).
   - Allocate items 4, 8, and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items with high values for Agent 1 are 6 (83), 0 (64), and 4 (72) but item 4 is already allocated.
   - Allocate items 6, 0, and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items with high values for Agent 2 are 0 (91), 1 (84), and 8 (73) but items 0 and 8 are already allocated.
   - Allocate items 1, 3, and 7 to Agent 2.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8, 2],
    "1": [6, 0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.
