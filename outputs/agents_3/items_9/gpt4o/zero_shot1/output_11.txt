Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69   4  48   6  87  74  21  71  80
1  24  75  41  22  24   0  35  13  54
2  16  19   9  13  47  86  39  95  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the total valuations each agent has for the items and try to balance the distribution of high-value items across the agents. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items: 0 (69), 1 (4), 2 (48), 3 (6), 4 (87), 5 (74), 6 (21), 7 (71), 8 (80)
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items: 0 (24), 1 (75), 2 (41), 3 (22), 4 (24), 5 (0), 6 (35), 7 (13), 8 (54)
  
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Items: 0 (16), 1 (19), 2 (9), 3 (13), 4 (47), 5 (86), 6 (39), 7 (95), 8 (70)

### Strategy:
- Try to allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most, while maintaining a balance in the total number of items each agent receives.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High-value items: 4 (87), 5 (74), 8 (80)
   - Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High-value items: 1 (75), 2 (41), 8 (54)
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High-value items: 5 (86), 7 (95), 8 (70)
   - Allocate items 7 and 8 to Agent 2.

4. Distribute remaining items to balance the allocation:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items among the agents, while considering their valuations. Each agent receives three items in this allocation.
