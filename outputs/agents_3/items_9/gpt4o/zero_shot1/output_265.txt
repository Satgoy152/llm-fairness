Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  52  39  51  37  90  18  74  39
1  62  43  95  28  67  40  30  44  20
2  46  95  41  26  40  51  81  48  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can utilize a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent is assigned an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One approach is to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, but we need to ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and ideally, the total value each agent receives is balanced.

Let's start by examining each agent's valuation for the items and attempt to distribute them in a balanced way:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (90), Item 0 (76), Item 7 (74)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 2 (95), Item 4 (67), Item 0 (62)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 1 (95), Item 6 (81), Item 5 (51)

Now, let's proceed with the allocation. We aim to allocate the items to agents in a way that maximizes their total satisfaction while ensuring an equitable distribution of items.

### Allocation Plan:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Allocate items: 0, 5, 7
  - Total valuation: 76 (item 0) + 90 (item 5) + 74 (item 7) = 240

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Allocate items: 2, 4
  - Total valuation: 95 (item 2) + 67 (item 4) = 162

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Allocate items: 1, 3, 6, 8
  - Total valuation: 95 (item 1) + 26 (item 3) + 81 (item 6) + 20 (item 8) = 222

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items fairly based on their valuations, and all items are distributed among the agents.
