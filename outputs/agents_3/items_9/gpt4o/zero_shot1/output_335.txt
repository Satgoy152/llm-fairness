Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  66  76  34  60   5  70  76  79
1  27  19  58  17  78  69  98  76  28
2  20  14  65  98  67  77  82  76  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, one approach is to try and maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll consider the valuations and try to distribute the items to balance the total value as evenly as possible among the agents.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Start by assigning high-value items to each agent to ensure a fair distribution of value.
- Then, allocate the remaining items to balance the total number received by each agent.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High-value items: Item 8 (79), Item 2 (76)
   - Total value: 155

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High-value items: Item 6 (98), Item 4 (78)
   - Total value: 176

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High-value items: Item 3 (98)
   - Total value: 98

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 (12) to Agent 0, bringing their total to 167.
- Assign item 1 (19) to Agent 1, bringing their total to 195.
- Assign item 5 (77) to Agent 2, bringing their total to 175.
- Assign item 7 (76) to Agent 2, bringing their total to 251.

### Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and tries to balance the total value among the agents as evenly as possible.
