Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  96  81  79  14  76  45  77  53
1  60  86  21  84  80  56  85   9  88
2  31  83  49  67  68  13  88  99  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least some items. We have 9 items and 3 agents, so each agent should ideally get 3 items to ensure fairness, if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (96).
   - Item 2 has the second highest valuation for Agent 0 (81).
   - Item 3 has the third highest valuation for Agent 0 (79).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 8 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (88).
   - Item 3 has the second highest valuation for Agent 1 (84), but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we skip it.
   - Item 0 has the third highest valuation for Agent 1 (60).
   - Item 4 has the next highest available valuation for Agent 1 (80).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 7 has the highest valuation for Agent 2 (99).
   - Item 6 has the second highest valuation for Agent 2 (88).
   - Item 4 has the third highest valuation for Agent 2 (68), but it's already allocated to Agent 1, so we skip it.
   - Item 3 has the next highest available valuation for Agent 2 (67), but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we skip it.
   - Item 5 is still available and has a valuation of 13 for Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that each agent gets 3 items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 0 (or adjust based on availability and maximizing each agent's total valuation)
- Agent 1: Items 8, 4, 3 (or adjust based on availability and maximizing each agent's total valuation)
- Agent 2: Items 7, 6, 5 (or adjust based on availability and maximizing each agent's total valuation)

Adjustments based on maximizing total valuation across all agents might be necessary if some items are claimed by multiple agents.

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [8, 4, 3],
    "2": [7, 6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and the distribution considers their valuations to ensure a fair distribution.
