Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  23  77  48  19  58   9  59  41
1  60  34  72  62   6  71  86  24  61
2  78  53  42  49  21  16  70  68  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value each agent gets from the items they are assigned, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuation table, we can follow a strategy such as maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive.

Let's break down the process of allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look at the highest values in the table for each agent and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.

2. **Ensure Fairness**: Distribute the items so that each agent ends up with a fair share of the total value.

3. **Consider Integer Allocation**: Ensure that each agent receives a whole number of items, with a total of 9 items distributed among them.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (77) and 0 (58).
- Agent 1 values items 6 (86) and 5 (71) highly.
- Agent 2 values items 0 (78) and 2 (42) but these are less valuable compared to other agents' preferences.
- We will allocate remaining items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that they value highly compared to others.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items that they value highly.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items that are remaining but still provide reasonable value to them.

By examining the above, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1 gets items: [5, 6, 8]
- Agent 2 gets items: [1, 4, 7]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [5, 6, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the total value each agent receives is fairly distributed based on their preferences.
