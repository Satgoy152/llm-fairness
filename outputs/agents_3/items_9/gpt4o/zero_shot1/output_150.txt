Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  60  91  29  77  99  19  39  92
1  77  32  44  95  85  42  61  37  88
2  49  12  71  33   4  43  56   8  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This approach involves assigning items based on the highest valuation each agent has for any given item, while also considering the need to balance the total number of items allocated.

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

- Agent 0: High valuations for items 0 (93), 2 (91), 5 (99), 8 (92)
- Agent 1: High valuations for items 3 (95), 4 (85), 8 (88)
- Agent 2: High valuations for items 2 (71), 6 (56)

A fair allocation strategy could be:

1. Assign items with the highest valuations to the respective agents.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Balance the number of items allocated to each agent.

Based on this analysis, here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 8
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6, 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, balancing the distribution while considering their valuations.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
