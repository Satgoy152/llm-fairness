Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  92  58  92  71  57  92  79  79
1  51  35   9  13  14  36  59   3   9
2  92  46  51   4  16  48  26  57  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a strategy similar to the "round-robin" method or a "max-min fair allocation" to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, while balancing the overall distribution.

Let's analyze the values:

Agent 0:
- High values: 92 (items 1, 3, 6), 79 (items 7, 8), 71 (item 4), 58 (item 2)

Agent 1:
- High values: 59 (item 6), 51 (item 0), 36 (item 5), 35 (item 1)

Agent 2:
- High values: 92 (item 0), 90 (item 8), 57 (items 5, 7), 51 (item 2), 48 (item 5)

Given these, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring no agent is left without items.
2. Balance the distribution by considering both the number of items and the total value received by each agent.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets: items 1, 3, 6 (total value: 276)
- Agent 1 gets: items 5, 4 (total value: 50)
- Agent 2 gets: items 0, 2, 7, 8 (total value: 290)

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives, while also ensuring each agent gets a non-zero number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 7, 8]
}
```
