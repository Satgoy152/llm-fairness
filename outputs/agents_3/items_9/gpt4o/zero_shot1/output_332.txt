Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  13  43  92  49   0  21  30  82
1  18  30  38  39  25   3  51  91  20
2  66  40  71  72  40  66  61  36  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 13 43 92 49  0 21 30 82]

 [66 40 71 72 40 66 61 36 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to give each agent an allocation that balances their preferences for the items as much as possible. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. We'll try to maximize the total valuation for each agent by selecting the items they value the most.

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** 37, 13, 43, 92, 49, 0, 21, 30, 82
- **Agent 1:** 18, 30, 38, 39, 25, 3, 51, 91, 20
- **Agent 2:** 66, 40, 71, 72, 40, 66, 61, 36, 91

We'll allocate the items to maximize the value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: 92 (Item 3), 82 (Item 8), 49 (Item 4)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: 91 (Item 7), 51 (Item 6), 39 (Item 3) [However, Item 3 is already allocated, so next highest is 38 (Item 2)]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: 91 (Item 8), 72 (Item 3), 71 (Item 2) [Both Item 3 and Item 2 are already allocated, so next highest is 66 (Item 0) and 66 (Item 5)]

Given these considerations and ensuring a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 will receive items: 3, 4, 8
- Agent 1 will receive items: 7, 6, 1
- Agent 2 will receive items: 2, 5, 0

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 8],
    "1": [7, 6, 1],
    "2": [2, 5, 0]
}
```
