Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  42  28  10  41   5  33  33  66
1  77   5  60  57  67  68  27  54  97
2  38  47  10  89  69  54   7  87  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction or value for each agent. Let's aim to assign items such that each agent gets close to their most valued items and all items are distributed.

1. **Agent 0**: Let's assign items 0, 8, and 6 because these are the highest values for agent 0 at 86, 66, and 33 respectively.

2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 4, 5, and 8 because these are among the highest values for agent 1 at 67, 68, and 97 respectively. However, item 8 is already assigned to agent 0, so let's choose items 3, 4, and 5 instead.

3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 3, 7, and 8 because these are the highest values for agent 2 at 89, 87, and 73 respectively. Since items 3 and 8 are already assigned, let's choose items 1, 7, and 2 instead.

Considering the above, let's re-evaluate to ensure all items are allocated and no conflicts:

- Give items 0, 6, and 8 to agent 0.
- Give items 1, 3, and 5 to agent 1.
- Give items 2, 4, and 7 to agent 2.

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and each of the 9 items is allocated exactly once.
