Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  29  33  75  69  45  62   7  12
1  31  88   2  76  57  14  65  80  28
2  71  86  78  24  71  71  22  32  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 86 78 24 71 71 22 32 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each one receives an integer number of items. Let's consider each agent's valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 
   - Item 3 (75), Item 4 (69), Item 6 (62)

2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**: 
   - Item 1 (88), Item 3 (76), Item 7 (80)

3. **Agent 2's highest valued items**:
   - Item 1 (86), Item 2 (78), Item 0 (71)

Considering the above, we need to ensure each agent gets some of their highest valued items:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 since it's their highest valued item.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 since it's their highest valued item.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 as it's one of their highest valued items.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (second highest valued for them).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1 (second highest valued for them).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (third highest valued for them).

Now, we have assigned 6 items. Let's assign the remaining 3 items:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (third highest valued for them).
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 1 (next highest available valued item for them).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (next highest available valued item for them).

Let's double-check by listing and finalizing the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7, 8
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual value while fairly distributing the total items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
