Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  54  93  99  18  14   1   6  62
1  30  79  59  28  48  10  17   1   8
2  80  87  25  46  79  41  73  20  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2), we will consider maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9 and each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 8.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Let's allocate the items based on these considerations:

1. Assign items 2, 3, and 8 to Agent 0.
2. Assign items 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign items 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 3 items
- Agent 1: 1 item
- Agent 2: 5 items

In total, 3 + 1 + 5 = 9 items have been allocated. This satisfies the condition that exactly 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7]
}
```
