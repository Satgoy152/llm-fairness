Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  64  81  22  34  98  25   6  83
1  60  26   2  76   8   1  29  51  66
2  15  48  38  28  51   7  54  39  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 64 81 22 34 98 25  6 83]
 [60 26  2 76  8  1 29 51 66]
 [15 48 38 28 51  7 54 39 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item for each agent and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (98), 2 (81), 8 (83)

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (76), 0 (60), 8 (66)

3. **Agent 2's Valuation:**
   - Highest valued items: 8 (97), 4 (51), 6 (54)

Given that we have to allocate 9 items fairly among the agents, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets: [0, 5]
  - Item 0: 26 (Agent 0), 60 (Agent 1), 15 (Agent 2)
  - Item 5: 98 (Agent 0), 1 (Agent 1), 7 (Agent 2)

- **Agent 1** gets: [1, 3, 7]
  - Item 1: 64 (Agent 0), 26 (Agent 1), 48 (Agent 2)
  - Item 3: 22 (Agent 0), 76 (Agent 1), 28 (Agent 2)
  - Item 7: 6 (Agent 0), 51 (Agent 1), 39 (Agent 2)

- **Agent 2** gets: [2, 4, 6, 8]
  - Item 2: 81 (Agent 0), 2 (Agent 1), 38 (Agent 2)
  - Item 4: 34 (Agent 0), 8 (Agent 1), 51 (Agent 2)
  - Item 6: 25 (Agent 0), 29 (Agent 1), 54 (Agent 2)
  - Item 8: 83 (Agent 0), 66 (Agent 1), 97 (Agent 2)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives and ensures that all items are distributed. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 6, 8]
}
```
