Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  54  18  45   9  71  73  94  51
1  16  37  46  27  75  39  71  78   3
2  21  51   2  55  71  94  68  30  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items for a fair distribution.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with the highest values for Agent 0 are: Item 0 (88), Item 7 (94), and Item 6 (73).
   - Allocate Items 0, 7, and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - After removing the items allocated to Agent 0, Agent 1's highest values are for: Item 4 (75), Item 6 (71) - already taken, and Item 7 (78) - already taken.
   - Next highest available are: Item 3 (27), Item 5 (39).
   - Allocate Items 4, 3, and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items for Agent 2 are: Items 1, 2, and 8.
   - Agent 2 values these as: Item 5 (94), Item 4 (71) - already taken, Item 3 (55) - already taken.
   - Highest available are: Item 5 (94), Item 1 (51), and Item 8 (36).
   - Allocate Items 5, 1, and 8 to Agent 2.

Now let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 7, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 2, 8]

This allocation ensures all items are allocated fairly, maximizing each agent's total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 6],
    "1": [4, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 8]
}
```
