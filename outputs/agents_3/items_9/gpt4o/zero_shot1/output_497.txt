Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  26  28  97  33  87  10  26  74
1  33  89  40  59  84  41  71  44  31
2   8  63  46  44  57  53  60  26  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. This can be done by considering each agent's valuations and trying to distribute the items so that each agent's total value is as close as possible to the others.

Here is one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Calculate total valuations for each agent and each item:
   - Agent 0: 409
   - Agent 1: 492
   - Agent 2: 398

2. Sort items by value for each agent and try to distribute them so that each agent gets a fair share.

After trying different combinations, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 8]
  - Total value: 28 + 97 + 74 = 199

- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 6]
  - Total value: 89 + 84 + 71 = 244

- Agent 2: Items [2, 5, 7]
  - Total value: 46 + 53 + 26 = 125

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives, while each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
