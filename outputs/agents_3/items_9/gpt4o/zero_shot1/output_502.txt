Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46   0  94  56  91  15   2  75  83
1  70  72  34  49  26  26  91   9  56
2   7  76  86  17  82  36  45  51  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[46  0 94 56 91 15  2 75 83]
 [70 72 34 49 26 26 91  9 56]
 [ 7 76 86 17 82 36 45 51 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items optimally:

- Agent 0: [46, 0, 94, 56, 91, 15, 2, 75, 83]
- Agent 1: [70, 72, 34, 49, 26, 26, 91, 9, 56]
- Agent 2: [7, 76, 86, 17, 82, 36, 45, 51, 29]

We'll assign items based on maximizing the sum of valuations each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 (Value: 94)
   - Item 4 (Value: 91)
   - Item 7 (Value: 75)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 (Value: 70)
   - Item 1 (Value: 72)
   - Item 6 (Value: 91)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 3 (Value: 17)
   - Item 5 (Value: 36)
   - Item 8 (Value: 29)

This way, each agent receives 3 items, and the allocation is based on maximizing their individual item values.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [3, 5, 8]
}
```
