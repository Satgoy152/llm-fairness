Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  20  53  47  43  97  83   5  45
1  71  64  12   8  96  10   2  30  93
2  93  46  62  71  51  97  63  95   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an equal or nearly equal number of items. Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items to achieve this goal.

### Steps:
1. **Consider the Total Number of Items**: Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

2. **Maximize the Value for Each Agent**:
   - For Agent 0, identify the top 3 items with the highest valuations.
   - For Agent 1, identify the top 3 items with the highest valuations.
   - For Agent 2, identify the top 3 items with the highest valuations.

3. **Allocate Based on Maximum Value**: Allocate these items to each agent, ensuring no item is counted twice.

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest values are for items: 5 (97), 6 (83), and 2 (53).

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest values are for items: 4 (96), 8 (93), and 0 (71).

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest values are for items: 0 (93), 7 (95), and 5 (97).

### Resolve Conflicts:
- Item 0 is preferred by both Agent 1 and Agent 2. Assign it to Agent 2 as Agent 1 already has high-value alternatives.
- Item 5 is preferred by both Agent 0 and Agent 2. Assign it to Agent 0 as Agent 2 has another high-value alternative.
  
### Final Allocation:
Here is the allocation of items to agents in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and the total allocation sums up to the 9 items available, with an emphasis on maximizing the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
