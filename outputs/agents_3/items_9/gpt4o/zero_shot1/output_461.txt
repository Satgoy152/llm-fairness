Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  55  76  38  87  88  59  43  75
1  77   3  71  48  74  37  54  84  19
2  91  60  93   4  66  34  69  28  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to the agents, aiming to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 6 + 55 + 76 + 38 + 87 + 88 + 59 + 43 + 75 = 527
- Agent 1: 77 + 3 + 71 + 48 + 74 + 37 + 54 + 84 + 19 = 467
- Agent 2: 91 + 60 + 93 + 4 + 66 + 34 + 69 + 28 + 77 = 522

Now, let's allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:

- Assign items with the highest values per agent while ensuring a fair distribution.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5, 2]
  - Values: 87, 88, 76
- Agent 1: Items [0, 7, 3]
  - Values: 77, 84, 48
- Agent 2: Items [1, 8, 6]
  - Values: 60, 77, 69

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their respective valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 2],
    "1": [0, 7, 3],
    "2": [1, 8, 6]
}
```
