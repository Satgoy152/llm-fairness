Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  26   0   3  78  34  86  42  31
1  67  41  20  23  30  89  61  63  78
2  22  43  54  94  87  78  45  95  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their preferences. Let's try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (86), Item 6 (86), Item 4 (78)
   - Allocate: [0, 4, 6]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (89), Item 8 (78), Item 7 (63)
   - Allocate: [5, 8, 7]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (94), Item 7 (95), Item 4 (87)
   - Allocate: [3, 1, 2]

Now, the total number of items allocated is 9 as required.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [5, 8, 7],
    "2": [3, 1, 2]
}
```
