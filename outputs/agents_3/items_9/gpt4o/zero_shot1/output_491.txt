Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  38  42  12  51  92  92  94  80
1  93  89  76  51  19  21  57  95  57
2  81  23  20  72  76  85  23  32  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to agents based on the highest value they have for those items, ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 5 (92), Item 6 (92), Item 7 (94)
   - Allocate items: 0, 5, 6, 7

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuations after Agent 0: Item 1 (89), Item 8 (57)
   - Allocate items: 1, 8

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Remaining items with relatively high values: Item 2 (20), Item 3 (72), Item 4 (76)
   - Allocate items: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations, ensuring all 9 items are allocated.
