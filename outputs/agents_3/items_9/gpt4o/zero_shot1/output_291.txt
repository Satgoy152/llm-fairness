Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  23  23  18  73  72  46  94  41
1  24  16  98   4  68  81  98  74  51
2  73  51  59  30  25  28  45   7  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 51 59 30 25 28 45  7 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We will use a simple greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 73, the highest, so assign it to agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 23, the highest, so assign it to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 98, the highest, so assign it to agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 30, the highest, so assign it to agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 73, the highest (tied with agent 1), so assign it to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 81, the highest, so assign it to agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 98, the highest, so assign it to agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 94, the highest, so assign it to agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 41, the highest, so assign it to agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 1, 4, 7, 8
- Agent 1 has items 2, 5, 6
- Agent 2 has items 0, 3

Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3]
}
```
