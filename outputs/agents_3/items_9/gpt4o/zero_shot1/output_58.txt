Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  55  45  35  90  32  76  37  34
1  49  58  43  29  76  76  97  12  78
2  25  41  67  90   6  63  62  93   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a systematic approach to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. We need to ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's start by considering each agent's preferences and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 4, 5
   - Values: 73, 90, 32
   - Total value: 73 + 90 + 32 = 195

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 6, 8
   - Values: 97, 78
   - Total value: 97 + 78 = 175

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 1, 2, 3, 7
   - Values: 41, 67, 90, 93
   - Total value: 41 + 67 + 90 + 93 = 291

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed fairly among the agents. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 7]
}
```
