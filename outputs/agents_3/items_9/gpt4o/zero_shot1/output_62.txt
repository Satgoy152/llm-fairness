Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  39  62  11  40  52  45  69  67
1  56  23  74  14  49  19  35  64  32
2  95  99  50  28  83  24  86  39  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. We also aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent considering their preferences.

Let's start by evaluating the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate based on maximizing their individual satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's Top Preferences:**
   - Item 7: 69
   - Item 8: 67
   - Item 2: 62

2. **Agent 1's Top Preferences:**
   - Item 2: 74
   - Item 7: 64
   - Item 0: 56

3. **Agent 2's Top Preferences:**
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 0: 95
   - Item 4: 83

Let's try to allocate items in a way that balances their total values while keeping the distribution fair:

- **Agent 0:** We will try to maximize their preference by allocating items they highly value but are less contested.
- **Agent 1:** Similarly, allocate items 1 highly values and are feasible.
- **Agent 2:** Focus on allocating items Agent 2 values highly.

Based on this distribution strategy:

- **Agent 0:** [7, 8, 5] (Total Value: 69 + 67 + 52 = 188)
- **Agent 1:** [2, 6] (Total Value: 74 + 35 = 109)
- **Agent 2:** [1, 0, 4, 3] (Total Value: 99 + 95 + 83 + 28 = 305)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and all 9 items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 0, 4, 3]
}
```
