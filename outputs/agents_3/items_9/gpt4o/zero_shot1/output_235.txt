Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  87  36  96  85  80  50  97  31
1  37  31  34  21  65  94  23  72  12
2  47  31  38  60  21  59  84  43  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple allocation strategy that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 3 (value 96)
   - Item 7 (value 97)
   - Item 4 (value 85)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 (value 94)
   - Item 0 (value 37)
   - Item 1 (value 31)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 6 (value 84)
   - Item 2 (value 38)
   - Item 8 (value 34)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while also distributing all 9 items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 4],
    "1": [5, 0, 1],
    "2": [6, 2, 8]
}
```
