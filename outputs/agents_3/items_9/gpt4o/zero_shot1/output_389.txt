Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  52  45  72  90  89  51  92  31
1  57  77  26  33  41  94  30  59  97
2  19  61  21  82  61  51  20  34  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We can use a simple method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction by looking at each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring a balanced distribution among the agents. Here's one potential fair allocation:

1. Assign the items to the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most, followed by item 7.
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most, followed by item 5.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most, followed by item 8.

A balanced allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 8, 5, 1
- Agent 2: Items 3, 0, 6, 2

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [8, 5, 1],
    "2": [3, 0, 6, 2]
}
```

This allocation considers each agentâ€™s valuations and distributes all items fairly.
