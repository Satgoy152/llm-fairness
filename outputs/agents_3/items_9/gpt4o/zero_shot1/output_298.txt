Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  23  77  70  71  31  20   7  53
1   4  73  25   5  13  15  91  17  90
2  68   8   2  83  57  74  32  80  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is placed with the agent who derives the highest value from it.
2. Make sure each agent gets a fair number of items, considering there are 9 items in total.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 at 4, Agent 2 at 68. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 73, Agent 2 at 8. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 25, Agent 2 at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 5, Agent 2 at 83. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 13, Agent 2 at 57. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 at 15, Agent 2 at 74. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 91, Agent 2 at 32. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 at 17, Agent 2 at 80. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 90, Agent 2 at 28. Assign to Agent 1.

Now let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 6, 8
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 3, 5, 7

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable number of items and maximizes their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
