Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  89  48  29  11  28  43  85  10
1  39  54  57  35  54  99   6  48  88
2  87  92  15  62  41  43  60  57  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 92 15 62 41 43 60 57 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by finding the highest value for each item across all agents and allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure that each agent has an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [54, 89, 48, 29, 11, 28, 43, 85, 10]
Agent 1: [39, 54, 57, 35, 54, 99, 6, 48, 88]
Agent 2: [87, 92, 15, 62, 41, 43, 60, 57, 19]
```

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items with highest valuations for them: Item 0, Item 7
- Agent 1 gets items with highest valuations for them: Item 5, Item 8
- Agent 2 gets items with highest valuations for them: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 4, Item 6

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and all items are allocated.
