Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  84  97  41  11  88  17  91  68
1   8  35  86  58   1  75  38  89  46
2  15  28  77  48  12  76  74  42  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. A common approach is to use the Max-Min Fairness principle or similar strategies to ensure fairness.

Based on the given valuations, we can try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share, considering their preferences:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High-value items for Agent 0 are: 2 (97), 7 (91), 5 (88)
   - Allocate items: 2, 7, 5

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High-value items for Agent 1 are: 2 (86), 7 (89), 5 (75), 3 (58)
   - Since item 2, 7, and 5 are already allocated to Agent 0, allocate other high-value items: 3, 8

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High-value items for Agent 2 are: 5 (76), 6 (74), 2 (77)
   - Since item 5 is already allocated, allocate remaining high-value items: 0, 1, 4, 6

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 5],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
