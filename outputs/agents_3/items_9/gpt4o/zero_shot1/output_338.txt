Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  32  58  49  33   3  14  74  47
1   0  11  87  65   2  56  63  78  43
2  83  33  68  22  99   1  99  71  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items so each agent receives a roughly equal total value based on their individual valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly.

Agent 0 values:
- Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Values: 38, 32, 58, 49, 33, 3, 14, 74, 47

Agent 1 values:
- Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Values: 0, 11, 87, 65, 2, 56, 63, 78, 43

Agent 2 values:
- Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Values: 83, 33, 68, 22, 99, 1, 99, 71, 28

We can try to allocate the items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

An example allocation might be:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0, 3, 8
  - Total value: 38 + 49 + 47 = 134

- Agent 1: Assign items 2, 5, 6
  - Total value: 87 + 56 + 63 = 206

- Agent 2: Assign items 1, 4, 7
  - Total value: 33 + 99 + 71 = 203

This allocation tries to balance the total values among the agents as much as possible. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
