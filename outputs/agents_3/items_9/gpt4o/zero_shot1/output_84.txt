Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  88  96  17  24  86  88  49  73
1  91  89  46  15  63  65  88  79  22
2  28  18  24  16  57  62  57  74  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [28 18 24 16 57 62 57 74 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. We'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 30 + 88 + 96 + 17 + 24 + 86 + 88 + 49 + 73 = 551
- Agent 1's total value: 91 + 89 + 46 + 15 + 63 + 65 + 88 + 79 + 22 = 558
- Agent 2's total value: 28 + 18 + 24 + 16 + 57 + 62 + 57 + 74 + 16 = 352

Next, let's try to allocate the items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible:

1. Assign items with high values to each agent, prioritizing items that are valued more uniquely by one agent compared to others.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 5, 8] (96, 86, 73)
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 6] (91, 89, 88)
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 7] (16, 57, 74)

Let's confirm the total values for each agent under this allocation:

- Agent 0: 96 + 86 + 73 = 255
- Agent 1: 91 + 89 + 88 = 268
- Agent 2: 16 + 57 + 74 = 147

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonably fair share of their preferred items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
