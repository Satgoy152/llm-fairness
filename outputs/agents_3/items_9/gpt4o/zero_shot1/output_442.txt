Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  53  97  19  53   7  14  52  14
1  95  28  49  22  76  59   9  74  76
2  61  67  83  28  19  28  33  28  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or utility of each agent. A common approach is to use a method similar to solving a type of assignment problem, aiming to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Determine the highest valued items for each agent and allocate those items first if possible.
2. Ensure each agent ends up with 3 items, as there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's break down the allocation:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - 2 (97), 1 (53), 4 (53)
- Agent 1 values items:
  - 0 (95), 4 (76), 8 (76)
- Agent 2 values items:
  - 2 (83), 1 (67), 0 (61)

Let's allocate based on highest valuation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 2 (97), item 1 (53), and item 3 (19).
2. Agent 1 receives item 0 (95), item 4 (76), and item 8 (76).
3. Agent 2 receives item 5 (28), item 6 (33), and item 7 (28).

This allocation gives each agent 3 items, and each item is allocated only once. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
