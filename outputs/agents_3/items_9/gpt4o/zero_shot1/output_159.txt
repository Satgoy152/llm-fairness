Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  47  51  19  35  47  42  34  35
1  57  86  34   2  78  70  74  90  66
2  66  35   9  95  75  82  45  90  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** To begin, calculate the sum of values for each agent to get a sense of how much each agent values all items combined.

2. **Try to Balance Allocations:** Allocate items to agents trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0: 
- Selected items: 0, 2, 4
- Total value: 27 + 51 + 35 = 113

Agent 1: 
- Selected items: 1, 5, 7
- Total value: 86 + 70 + 90 = 246

Agent 2:
- Selected items: 3, 6, 8
- Total value: 95 + 45 + 60 = 200

These allocations aim to balance the total value each agent gets, given the constraint of integer allocations. 

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 6, 8]
}
```
