Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  11  60  45  66  91   4   6  15
1  39  50  37  32   9  29  28  86   9
2  19   1  82  83  52  91   7   3  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Assign items to agents who have the highest valuation for them. This ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Initial Assignment**:
    - Item 0: Agent 0 (value 78)
    - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 11)
    - Item 2: Agent 2 (value 82)
    - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 83)
    - Item 4: Agent 0 (value 66)
    - Item 5: Agent 0 (value 91)
    - Item 6: Agent 1 (value 28)
    - Item 7: Agent 1 (value 86)
    - Item 8: Agent 2 (value 93)

3. **Adjustments for Balance**: Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. We can balance the allocation so that the distribution doesn't heavily favor one agent over others.

4. **Final Allocation**:
    - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4, 5]
    - Agent 1: Items [6, 7]
    - Agent 2: Items [2, 3, 8]

Here is the JSON output for the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
