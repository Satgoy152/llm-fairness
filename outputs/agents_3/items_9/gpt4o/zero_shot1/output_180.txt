Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  64  34  61  80  59  32  68  67
1  69  96  48  44  66  21  14  73  26
2  92  62  83  85  26  64  54  62  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with the highest values for Agent 0 are 4 (80), 1 (64), and 7 (68). 
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with the highest values for Agent 1 are 1 (96), 0 (69), and 7 (73). However, item 1 and 7 are already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest available values for Agent 1 are items 0 (69), 4 (66), and 3 (44).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with the highest values for Agent 2 are 0 (92), 2 (83), and 3 (85). However, item 0 and 3 are already taken by other agents.
   - Next highest available values for Agent 2 are items 2 (83), 5 (64), and 6 (54).

Taking these considerations into account, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [4, 1, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 8]
- Agent 2: [2, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on the remaining available items. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 7],
    "1": [0, 3, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
