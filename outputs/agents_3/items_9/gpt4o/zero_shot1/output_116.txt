Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  52  71  94  93  36  31  82  63
1  65  42  46   6  12  59  43  69  40
2  76  92  87  88  94   4  50  12  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to provide each agent with a reasonable share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:
- Agent 0 values items like 3 and 4 highly.
- Agent 1 has moderate valuations for most items but values item 0 highly.
- Agent 2 values items like 4 and 0 highly.

A possible fair allocation might take into consideration both the highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least some items. Let's ensure the total valuation per agent is balanced as much as possible.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 5, 7] (valuations: 94, 36, 82)
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1, 6] (valuations: 65, 42, 43)
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 4, 8] (valuations: 87, 94, 90)

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and ensures all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 8]
}
```
