Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  94  47  28  62  50  65   3  65
1  80  63  79  78  31  44  77  79  57
2  10  70  33  67  33  77   1  61  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their individual valuations. This involves analyzing the valuation table and distributing the items such that the overall satisfaction is balanced across all agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 6 (65), Item 8 (65)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (80), Item 2 (79), Item 7 (79)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (77), Item 3 (67), Item 4 (33)

This allocation ensures each agent gets three items, and the distribution of high-valued items is fairly even.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [5, 3, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 3 agents, with each agent receiving items that they value relatively highly.
