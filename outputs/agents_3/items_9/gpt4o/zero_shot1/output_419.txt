Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  64  43  34  79  73   5   9  97
1  65  46   1  98  82  89  39  22  97
2  14  24  89   3  70  83  73   2  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has on all items.
2. Distribute the items among the agents in a way that maximizes the sum of each agent's valuations for their allocated items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 20 + 64 + 43 + 34 + 79 + 73 + 5 + 9 + 97 = 424
- Agent 1: 65 + 46 + 1 + 98 + 82 + 89 + 39 + 22 + 97 = 539
- Agent 2: 14 + 24 + 89 + 3 + 70 + 83 + 73 + 2 + 68 = 426

Now, we allocate the items to maximize each agent's valuation:

1. Assign items with the highest individual value for each agent, ensuring no duplication.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 8 (value 97)
  - Item 4 (value 79)
  - Item 5 (value 73)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 3 (value 98)
  - Item 5 (value 89)
  - Item 4 (value 82)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 2 (value 89)
  - Item 5 (value 83)
  - Item 6 (value 73)

Now, we ensure each item is only assigned once and reallocate if necessary:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 8 (value 97)
  - Item 1 (value 64)
  - Item 0 (value 20)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 3 (value 98)
  - Item 4 (value 82)
  - Item 7 (value 22)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 2 (value 89)
  - Item 5 (value 83)
  - Item 6 (value 73)

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while each item is allocated to only one agent.
