Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  54  52  89  26  60   5  93  44
1   8   0  22  47  43  87  22  63  88
2  32  72  59  30  67  42  16  78  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 54 52 89 26 60  5 93 44]
 [ 8  0 22 47 43 87 22 63 88]
 [32 72 59 30 67 42 16 78 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the items based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [58, 54, 52, 89, 26, 60, 5, 93, 44]
   - Highest valued items: 7 (93), 3 (89), 0 (58), 5 (60)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [8, 0, 22, 47, 43, 87, 22, 63, 88]
   - Highest valued items: 8 (88), 5 (87), 7 (63), 3 (47)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuations: [32, 72, 59, 30, 67, 42, 16, 78, 33]
   - Highest valued items: 7 (78), 1 (72), 4 (67), 2 (59)

Considering a fair distribution while maximizing individual valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0, 3, and 7. This allocation gives Agent 0 high-value items based on their preference.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 5, and 8. These items are among the highest valued for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 1, 2, 4, and 6. This allocation provides Agent 2 with some of their highest valued items.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items while aiming for a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 4, 6]
}
```
