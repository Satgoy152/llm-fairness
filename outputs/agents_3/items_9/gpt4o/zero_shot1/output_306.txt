Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  74  85  81  70  59  44  70  67
1  82  59  34  58  61  61  77  97  54
2  59  10  78  25  73  27  66  10   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can approach this problem by considering each agent's valuation of the items and then assigning the items in a way that balances the allocations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, and then continue assigning in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

2. Track the total value each agent receives to ensure fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 88, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 74, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 85, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 81, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 73, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 61, which is tied with Agent 2, but since Agent 1 has fewer items currently, assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 77, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 97, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 67, which is the highest valuation for this item. Assign to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6, 7
- Agent 2: Item 4

Now, present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [4]
}
```
