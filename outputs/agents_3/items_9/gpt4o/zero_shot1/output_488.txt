Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  38  51  33  85  23  84  52  57
1   6  23  96  47   6   9   7  40   2
2  52  23  11  14  66  45  16   1  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation per item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. List all items with their valuations for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than necessary items to maintain a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 6, Agent 2 at 52. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 23, Agent 2 at 23. Assign to Agent 0 (tie-breaker).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 96, Agent 2 at 11. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 at 47, Agent 2 at 14. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 6, Agent 2 at 66. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 9, Agent 2 at 45. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 7, Agent 2 at 16. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 at 40, Agent 2 at 1. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 57, Agent 1 at 2, Agent 2 at 49. Assign to Agent 0.

Now let's ensure a fair distribution:
- Agent 0 has 6 items: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8.
- Agent 1 has 2 items: 2, 3.
- Agent 2 has 1 item: 5.

This allocation maximizes the sum of the individual valuations. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5]
}
```
