Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  96  68  22  80   3  91  19   4
1  32  22  36  66  90  53  33   5  73
2  60  10  72  47  53   2  13  15  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a simple heuristic approach to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of value based on their individual valuations. The key is to balance the distribution of items so that each agent ends up with a fair share of the total value according to their preferences. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 4, 3, and 8.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 2, 7, and 5.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest preference:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 4, 3, and 8.
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 7, and 5.

This allocation gives each agent three items and tries to maximize their individual preferences as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 3, 8],
    "2": [2, 7, 5]
}
```
