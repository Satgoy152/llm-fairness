Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  23  95   6  82  75  53   0   9
1  38  65  69  63  12  98  48  74  71
2  13  19  54  17  92  17   5  91  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 23 95  6 82 75 53  0  9]
 [38 65 69 63 12 98 48 74 71]
 [13 19 54 17 92 17  5 91 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the total value each agent assigns to the items and aim to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 4, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4, 7, and 1.

To balance the allocation, we can attempt to distribute the items as follows:

- Assign items that have the highest value for a particular agent, while ensuring that each agent gets roughly the same number of items (three items each in this case, since there are 9 items and 3 agents).

Allocation strategy:
- Agent 0 can get items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 can get items 1, 7, and 8.
- Agent 2 can get items 3, 4, and 6.

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while also distributing the total items evenly across all agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 7, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
