Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79   1  31  90  60  77  24  79  97
1  89  62  92   2  50  96  46  47  88
2  39  80  16  38  60  84  45  80  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79  1 31 90 60 77 24 79 97]
 [89 62 92  2 50 96 46 47 88]
 [39 80 16 38 60 84 45 80 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation matrix and aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent is fairly balanced.

Given the valuations:
```
Agent 0: 79, 1, 31, 90, 60, 77, 24, 79, 97
Agent 1: 89, 62, 92, 2, 50, 96, 46, 47, 88
Agent 2: 39, 80, 16, 38, 60, 84, 45, 80, 74
```

We aim to distribute the items to achieve a fair allocation. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 3, 4, and 8. Total valuation for Agent 0 is 90 + 60 + 97 = 247.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 0, 2, and 5. Total valuation for Agent 1 is 89 + 92 + 96 = 277.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 1, 6, and 7. Total valuation for Agent 2 is 80 + 45 + 80 = 205.

This allocation strives for a balance in total valuations among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
