Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  78  70  17  53  12  79   9  16
1  47  89  80  28  29  91  15  42  35
2  46  83  82  52  73  99  13  17  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 83 82 52 73 99 13 17 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Additionally, we want to ensure that all 9 items are allocated. 

We can use a simple greedy approach by selecting the highest valued items sequentially for each agent until all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5 and 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 8.

Let's assign the items based on this understanding:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 94)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 78)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 79)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 91)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 80)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 73)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (value 74)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 52)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value 17)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4, 8, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
