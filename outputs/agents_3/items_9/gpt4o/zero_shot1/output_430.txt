Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  78  54  23  88  78   1  49  91
1  90  89  64  62  69  43  88  72  41
2  17  92  64  58  67  86  80  18  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can approach this by initially considering the highest valuations for each agent and distributing items to balance the overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (88), 1 (78), and 5 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (90), 1 (89), and 6 (88).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (92), 5 (86), and 6 (80).

To ensure a fair allocation, we should ensure that each agent receives a fair share of high-value items while considering the need to allocate exactly 9 items in total.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 5]
  - Valuation: 88 (item 4) + 78 (item 5) = 166

- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 6]
  - Valuation: 90 (item 0) + 88 (item 6) = 178

- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
  - Valuation: 92 (item 1) + 64 (item 2) + 58 (item 3) + 18 (item 7) + 48 (item 8) = 280

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair division, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
