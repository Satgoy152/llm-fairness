Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  22  71  38  24  96  19  60  63
1  64  70  26  48  77  70  47  49  76
2  36  89  84  68  55  31   3  29  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62 22 71 38 24 96 19 60 63]
 [64 70 26 48 77 70 47 49 76]
 [36 89 84 68 55 31  3 29 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuation table, one approach is to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations for allocated items) is maximized.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 62, 22, 71, 38, 24, 96, 19, 60, 63
- Agent 1: 64, 70, 26, 48, 77, 70, 47, 49, 76
- Agent 2: 36, 89, 84, 68, 55, 31, 3, 29, 14

A potential allocation strategy:
1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations in descending order.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

### Allocation:
- Agent 0 should get items with high valuations: 5 (96), 2 (71), 0 (62)
- Agent 1 should get items with high valuations: 4 (77), 1 (70), 8 (76)
- Agent 2 should get items with high valuations: 3 (68), 6 (3), 7 (29)

This allocation ensures a fairly even distribution based on the highest preferences of each agent, maximizing their satisfaction.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 0],
    "1": [4, 1, 8],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
