Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  67  31  88  51  12  35  27  14
1  59  62  12  47  89   9  36  82  54
2  88  97  89  18  79  53   3  92  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 97 89 18 79 53  3 92 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize their individual valuations, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy approach by iteratively assigning the most valuable available item to the agent who values it most until all items are allocated.

Here are the steps:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it highest (88).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it highest (97).
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it highest (89).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it highest (88).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest (89).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it highest (53).
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it highest (36).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it highest (92).
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it highest (54).

We need to check if this assignment is fair in terms of the number of items each agent receives. After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4, 6, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]

Agent 0 only has one item, agent 1 has three items, and agent 2 has five items. To make it fairer in terms of distribution, we need to reallocate some items:

Let's consider reallocating to balance the number of items:

1. Move item 0 from agent 2 to agent 0.
2. Move item 7 from agent 2 to agent 1.

After this reallocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [4, 6, 8, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 5]

Now each agent has a more balanced distribution of items. 

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 6, 8, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
