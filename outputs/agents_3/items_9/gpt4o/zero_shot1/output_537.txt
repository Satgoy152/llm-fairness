Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  94  99  36  38  42  19  18  23
1  72  40  82  94  77  56  45  95  13
2   0  48  97  16   4  33  82  35  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.

A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 72, and Agent 2 at 0. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 40, and Agent 2 at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 at 82, and Agent 2 at 97. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 94, and Agent 2 at 16. Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 38, Agent 1 at 77, and Agent 2 at 4. Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 56, and Agent 2 at 33. Assign to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 at 45, and Agent 2 at 82. Assign to Agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 95, and Agent 2 at 35. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 13, and Agent 2 at 78. Assign to Agent 2.

Now we ensure each agent has some items and the total items allocated is 9:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [0, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: [6, 8]

These allocations maximize each agent's total valuation and distribute all items.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "2": [6, 8]
}
```
