Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  59  14  37  71  67   8   1   0
1  90  95  24  31  85  72  33  33  19
2  82  14  63  22  86  77  90  87  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 14 63 22 86 77 90 87 20]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use a simple approach that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. We need to consider each agent's valuation of each item and distribute the items such that the total satisfaction is maximized.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We can allocate items that are more valuable to Agent 0 than to the others.
2. **Agent 1**: We can allocate items that are more valuable to Agent 1 than to the others.
3. **Agent 2**: We can allocate items that are more valuable to Agent 2 than to the others.

Considering the valuations given:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items: 1 (59), 3 (37), 4 (71), and 5 (67).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items: 0 (90), 1 (95), 4 (85), and 5 (72).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items: 0 (82), 2 (63), 5 (77), and 6 (90).

Let's allocate:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items 3 (37) and 8 (0) for a total value of 37.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items 1 (95), 4 (85), and 7 (33) for a total value of 213.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items 0 (82), 2 (63), 5 (77), and 6 (90) for a total value of 312.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
