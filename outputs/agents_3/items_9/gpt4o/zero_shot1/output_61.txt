Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  80  67  48  55  66  90  28  17
1  36  21  47  79  58  14  94  45  70
2  77  17  89  61  24  34   2  45  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [77 17 89 61 24 34  2 45 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and perform an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High values: Item 6 (90), Item 1 (80), Item 2 (67)
   - Allocate items 6 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High values: Item 6 (94), Item 3 (79), Item 8 (70)
   - Item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, so allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High values: Item 2 (89), Item 0 (77), Item 3 (61)
   - Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 1, so allocate items 2 and 0 to Agent 2.

Now, let's re-evaluate to allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 4, 5, 7
- Check remaining high valuations:
  - Agent 0 has a high value for item 5 (66).
  - Agent 1 has a moderate value for item 5 (14).
  - Agent 2 has a moderate value for item 4 (24).

Allocate:
- Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest preference).
- Item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest preference from remaining items).
- Item 7 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 could use one more item and has a moderate value for item 7).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 5],
    "1": [3, 8, 7],
    "2": [2, 0, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
