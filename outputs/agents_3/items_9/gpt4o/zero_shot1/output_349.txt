Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  42  67  53  82  12  55  75  98
1  43  49  49   0   5  20  62  14  78
2  61  64  23  48  25  84  30  91  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 49 49  0  5 20 62 14 78]
 [61 64 23 48 25 84 30 91 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total value, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's valuations and find a reasonable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (98), Item 4 (82), Item 2 (67)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (78), Item 0 (43), Item 6 (62)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (91), Item 5 (84), Item 1 (64)

After reviewing the valuations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Allocate items 8, 4, and 2. This selection gives Agent 0 significant value (98, 82, 67).

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Allocate items 6, 0, and 3. This gives Agent 1 good value (62, 43, 0). Although item 3 has a value of 0 for Agent 1, it is the least valuable item for all agents, and we must allocate all items.

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Allocate items 7, 5, and 1. This gives Agent 2 significant value (91, 84, 64).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4, 2],
    "1": [6, 0, 3],
    "2": [7, 5, 1]
}
```
