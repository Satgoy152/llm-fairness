Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  77   8  71  69  58  11  48  61
1  78  14   4  15  95  64  65  67  28
2  92  59  63  82  23  20  89  56  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and aim to distribute the total value as evenly as possible. The goal is to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring each gets a fair share of the items.

Let's break down the valuations to determine an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (89), Item 1 (77), Item 3 (71)
   - Medium values: Item 4 (69), Item 5 (58), Item 8 (61)

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (95), Item 5 (64)
   - Medium values: Item 7 (67), Item 6 (65)

3. **Agent 2's valuations:**
   - Highest values: Item 8 (97), Item 0 (92), Item 3 (82)
   - Medium values: Item 6 (89), Item 2 (63)

Considering these valuations, here is a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 1, 5]
  - Total valuation: 89 + 77 + 58 = 224

- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 6]
  - Total valuation: 95 + 65 = 160

- **Agent 2:** Items [2, 3, 7, 8]
  - Total valuation: 63 + 82 + 56 + 97 = 298

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
