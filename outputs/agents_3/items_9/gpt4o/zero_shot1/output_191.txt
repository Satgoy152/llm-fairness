Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  34   0   1  55  29  24  97  77
1  73  27  48  36  58  72  36  30   8
2  57  59  82  48  94  11   6  18  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 59 82 48 94 11  6 18 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One straightforward approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the table and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 73, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 59, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 82, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 48, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 94, which is the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 72, which is the highest.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 24, which is the highest.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 97, which is the highest.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 77, which is the highest.

Now, let's make sure the allocation is balanced and fair in terms of the number of items:

- Agent 0 currently has items 6, 7, 8.
- Agent 1 currently has items 0, 5.
- Agent 2 currently has items 1, 2, 3, 4.

The allocation is now as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fairly distributed number of items based on their highest valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
