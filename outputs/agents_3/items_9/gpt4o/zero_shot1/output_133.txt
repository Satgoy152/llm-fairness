Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  27   4   8  60  51  23  70  46
1  28  71   7  92  94  94  31  91  11
2  66  14  88  65  48  18   6  13  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. We will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with high value: 70 (item 7), 60 (item 4).
   - Allocate items: 4, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with high value: 94 (item 4), 94 (item 5), 92 (item 3), 91 (item 7).
   - Allocate items: 3, 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items with high value: 88 (item 2), 66 (item 0), 65 (item 3).
   - Allocate items: 0, 2, 8, 6, 1 

This configuration ensures a fair distribution based on the values above:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 1, 6, 8]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 7, which are highly valued by them.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5, which are highly valued by them.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, 1, 6, and 8, balancing their higher values.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a set of items, and all items are distributed.
