Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  88  16  16   9  24  28  86  19
1  13  31  43  84   5  11  14  29  32
2  92  44  91  59  30  68  96  63   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while considering their valuations, we can adopt a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given table:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 22
   - Agent 1 values it at 13
   - Agent 2 values it at 92 (highest value)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 43
   - Agent 2 values it at 91 (highest value)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 84 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 59
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Agent 2 values it at 30 (highest value)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 24
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 68 (highest value)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Agent 2 values it at 96 (highest value)
   - Allocate to Agent 2

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 29
   - Agent 2 values it at 63
   - Allocate to Agent 0

9. **Item 8**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 19
   - Agent 1 values it at 32 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 7
   - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, the allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items being allocated.
