Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  92  78  28  41  94  61  53  73
1  37   3  58  83  98   7   5  59  47
2  60  84  98  67  23  28  80  41  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 92 78 28 41 94 61 53 73]
 [37  3 58 83 98  7  5 59 47]
 [60 84 98 67 23 28 80 41 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [25, 92, 78, 28, 41, 94, 61, 53, 73]
- Agent 1 values: [37, 3, 58, 83, 98, 7, 5, 59, 47]
- Agent 2 values: [60, 84, 98, 67, 23, 28, 80, 41, 94]

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items so that each agent receives high-value items that maximize their satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing individual agent values:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: 94 (item 5), 92 (item 1)
   - Allocation: [1, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: 98 (item 4), 83 (item 3)
   - Allocation: [3, 4]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: 98 (item 2), 94 (item 8), 84 (item 1), 80 (item 6)
   - Allocation: [0, 2, 6, 7, 8]

Now, let's ensure that items are fairly distributed and total 9 items:

- Agent 0: [1, 5] (total: 2 items)
- Agent 1: [3, 4] (total: 2 items)
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 6, 7, 8] (total: 5 items)

This allocation gives a total of 9 items distributed among the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 2, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
