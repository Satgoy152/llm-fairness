Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  97  71   3  82  83  93  34  15
1  63  90  10  24  22  64  55  47  34
2  52  65  18  35  42  55  77  20  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 8 and 6.

We'll try to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign items 0, 1, 6 to Agent 0. These are some of the highest values for Agent 0.
- Assign items 3, 4, 5 to Agent 1. This includes item 5, which is one of the highest values for Agent 1.
- Assign items 2, 7, 8 to Agent 2. This allocation includes item 8, which is one of the highest values for Agent 2.

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents and tries to maximize their total valuation.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 8]
}
```
