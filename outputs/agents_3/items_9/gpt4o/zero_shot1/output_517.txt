Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  56  53  29  67  53  61  46  21
1  50  79  24  37  70  17  85  64  91
2  79  85  60  79  10  98  30  61   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items according to their preferences while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (67), Item 6 (61), Item 1 (56)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (91), Item 6 (85), Item 1 (79)
   - Since Item 6 and Item 1 are already allocated to Agent 0, we will allocate the next highest available items.
   - Allocate: Item 8 (91), Item 3 (37), Item 0 (50)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 1 (85), Item 0 (79)
   - Since Item 1 and Item 0 are already allocated, we'll allocate the next highest available items.
   - Allocate: Item 5 (98), Item 2 (60), Item 7 (61)

The allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 1],
    "1": [8, 3, 0],
    "2": [5, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items and the total allocation equals 9 items.
