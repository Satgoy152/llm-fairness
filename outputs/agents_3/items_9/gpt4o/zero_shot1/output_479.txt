Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  90   2  50  43  34  96  81  13
1  78   6  58  65  66   5  95  26  91
2  99  67   0  47  94  88  79   2  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable total valuation. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:  
- Items and values: [(0, 26), (1, 90), (2, 2), (3, 50), (4, 43), (5, 34), (6, 96), (7, 81), (8, 13)]

Agent 1:  
- Items and values: [(0, 78), (1, 6), (2, 58), (3, 65), (4, 66), (5, 5), (6, 95), (7, 26), (8, 91)]

Agent 2:  
- Items and values: [(0, 99), (1, 67), (2, 0), (3, 47), (4, 94), (5, 88), (6, 79), (7, 2), (8, 32)]

A possible allocation strategy could be to allocate items based on the highest value for each item, ensuring each agent gets a fair share in terms of the number of items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 7] (Values 90, 81)
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 8] (Values 58, 65, 91)
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4, 5, 6] (Values 99, 94, 88, 79)

This allocation attempts to balance the total number of items distributed among agents while considering their valuations for those items.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 8],
    "2": [0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
