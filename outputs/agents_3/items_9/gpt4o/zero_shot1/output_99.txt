Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  32  38  26  20  36  52  30  27
1  58  72  34  44  76  42  88  44  97
2   7  97  47  28  89  71  95  81  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Start by identifying which items have the highest values for each agent.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:** Begin by allocating the highest valued items to each respective agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Continue Allocation by Satisfaction:** After each agent has at least one item, continue to allocate remaining items, focusing on maximizing the satisfaction (or value) for each agent.

Let's go through the process using the given valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Highest values are for items 0 (55), 6 (52), and 2 (38).
- **Agent 1:** Highest values are for items 8 (97), 6 (88), and 4 (76).
- **Agent 2:** Highest values are for items 1 (97), 6 (95), and 4 (89).

**Initial Allocation:**
- **Agent 0:** Allocate item 0 (value 55)
- **Agent 1:** Allocate item 8 (value 97)
- **Agent 2:** Allocate item 1 (value 97)

**Allocate Remaining Items:**
- **Agent 0:** Next highest values are items 6 (52) and 2 (38)
- **Agent 1:** After item 8, next highest values are 6 (88) and 4 (76)
- **Agent 2:** After item 1, next highest values are 6 (95) and 4 (89)

We can see that item 6 is desired by all agents, but Agent 2 values it the most.

**Final Allocation Based on Maximizing Satisfaction:**
- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 8, 4
- **Agent 2:** Items 1, 6, 7

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- **Agent 0:** Can take item 3 (26) and item 5 (36)
- **Agent 1:** Takes item 4 (76)
- **Agent 2:** Takes item 1 (97), item 6 (95), item 7 (81)

So the allocation is complete with each agent receiving items based on maximizing their satisfaction, and all items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
