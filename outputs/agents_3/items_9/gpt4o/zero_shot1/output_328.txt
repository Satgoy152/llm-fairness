Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  53  23  99   4  14  77   2  59
1  33   8  16  42  45  28  63  12  53
2  86  15  43  72  94  36  38   7  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 3 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to the items to ensure a fair distribution:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (99), Item 6 (77), Item 1 (53)
   - Allocate items 3, 6, and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (45), Item 8 (53), Item 6 (63)
   - Item 6 is already taken by Agent 0, so we take the next highest available.
   - Allocate items 4, 8, and 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (94), Item 0 (86), Item 3 (72)
   - Both items 4 and 3 are already taken, so we take the next highest available.
   - Allocate items 0, 7, and 2 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 1],
    "1": [4, 8, 5],
    "2": [0, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly among the agents, ensuring each agent gets 3 items and maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
