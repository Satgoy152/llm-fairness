Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  17  65  72  66  58  95  76  46
1  21  79  18   1  39  44  34  97  26
2  58  84   8   2  43  64  37   0  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation by assigning items based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **List the Items with Their Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [81, 17, 65, 72, 66, 58, 95, 76, 46]
   - Agent 1: [21, 79, 18, 1, 39, 44, 34, 97, 26]
   - Agent 2: [58, 84, 8, 2, 43, 64, 37, 0, 48]

2. **Identify Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 6, 0, and 3.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 7, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 1, 5, and 4.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

4. **Continue Allocating to Balance the Items:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 6. Next highest values are for items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1: Already has item 7. Next highest values are for items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 2: Already has item 1. Next highest values are for items 5 and 4.

5. **Adjust to Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3 in addition to item 6.
   - Agent 1 receives items 7, 5, and 8.
   - Agent 2 receives items 1, 2, and 4.

6. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Verify that all 9 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [5, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while taking into account the agents' preferences and ensuring each agent receives a fair share.
