Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  79  96  75  35  87  62  21   7
1  23  58  27  61  59  52  47  76  85
2  80  81  95  34  13   3  88   5  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 79 96 75 35 87 62 21  7]
 [23 58 27 61 59 52 47 76 85]
 [80 81 95 34 13  3 88  5 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated. We'll look for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [37, 79, 96, 75, 35, 87, 62, 21, 7]
Agent 1: [23, 58, 27, 61, 59, 52, 47, 76, 85]
Agent 2: [80, 81, 95, 34, 13, 3, 88, 5, 30]
```

A simple heuristic approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but we must ensure that each agent ends up with a fair number of items. Let's follow this method while maintaining an approximately equal distribution of items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it most (80).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it most (81).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it most (96).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it most (75).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it most (59).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it most (87).
7. **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it most (88).
8. **Item 7:** Agent 1 values it most (76).
9. **Item 8:** Agent 1 values it most (85).

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 7, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1, 6]

This allocation gives each agent three items, which is fair given the total of nine items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
