Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  76   4  31  34  12  57  59  16
1  35   2  94  45  57  71  66  59  82
2  60  33  17  47  55  68  53  21  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 76  4 31 34 12 57 59 16]

 [60 33 17 47 55 68 53 21 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize their overall satisfaction. Here is a potential allocation:

1. Evaluate the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the distribution of items remains fair.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 72 (highest).
- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 76 (highest).
- Item 2:
  - Agent 1 values it at 94 (highest).
- Item 3:
  - Agent 2 values it at 47 (highest).
- Item 4:
  - Agent 1 values it at 57 (highest).
- Item 5:
  - Agent 2 values it at 68 (highest).
- Item 6:
  - Agent 1 values it at 66 (highest).
- Item 7:
  - Agent 0 values it at 59 (highest).
- Item 8:
  - Agent 1 values it at 82 (highest).

Now, let's check the distribution to ensure each agent receives a fair number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4, 6, 8
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5

There are 9 items in total, and each agent receives at least 2 items. This distribution seems balanced and fair.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 8],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
