Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  94  70  67  61  80  44  23   5
1  89  58  34  98  66  25  45  20  94
2  66  26  14  95  85  86  11  89  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can approach this problem by considering the highest valuation for each item and allocating accordingly. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this at 93, which is the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this at 94, which is the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this at 70, which is the highest.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this at 98, which is the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values this at 85, which is the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values this at 86, which is the highest.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values this at 44, which is the highest.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values this at 89, which is the highest.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values this at 94, which is the highest.

With these considerations, the allocations can be structured as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the total valuation for each agent is reasonably high.
