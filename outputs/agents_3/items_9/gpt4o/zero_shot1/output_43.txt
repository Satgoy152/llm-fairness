Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  85  40  41  28  24  21  26  67
1  29  31   1  53  16  39  93   2  68
2  25  31  67  52  86  23  62  19  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 85 40 41 28 24 21 26 67]
 [29 31  1 53 16 39 93  2 68]
 [25 31 67 52 86 23 62 19 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation.

### Valuation Table:

```
Agent 0: [68, 85, 40, 41, 28, 24, 21, 26, 67]
Agent 1: [29, 31,  1, 53, 16, 39, 93,  2, 68]
Agent 2: [25, 31, 67, 52, 86, 23, 62, 19, 62]
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Highest-valued items: 1 (85), 0 (68), 8 (67)
  
2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest-valued items: 6 (93), 8 (68), 3 (53)
    
3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest-valued items: 4 (86), 2 (67), 6 (62)

### Initial Allocation:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Remaining Items**: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8

5. **Agent 0**:
    - Already has item 1.
    - Next highest values: 0 (68), 8 (67)
  
6. **Agent 1**:
    - Already has item 6.
    - Next highest values: 8 (68), 3 (53)
    
7. **Agent 2**:
    - Already has item 4.
    - Next highest values: 2 (67), 8 (62)

### Resolving Conflicts:

- Both Agent 0 and Agent 1 want item 8. Allocate to Agent 0 since Agent 1 can take item 3.
- Agent 2 takes item 2.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 8, 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 6, 3, 5
- **Agent 2**: Items 4, 2, 7

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8, 0],
    "1": [6, 3, 5],
    "2": [4, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
