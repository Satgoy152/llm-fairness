Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  68  71  70  67   5   3  97  98
1   9  29  42  53  91  28  17  14  93
2  55  36  32  57  96  83  38  91  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 68 71 70 67  5  3 97 98]
 [ 9 29 42 53 91 28 17 14 93]
 [55 36 32 57 96 83 38 91 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we want to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: We focus on items with the highest values for this agent.
   - Item 7: Value 97
   - Item 8: Value 98
   - Item 0: Value 92

2. **Agent 1**: We allocate items where Agent 1 has relatively high valuations.
   - Item 4: Value 91
   - Item 8: Value 93 (already allocated to Agent 0, so we skip and choose another)
   - Item 3: Value 53

3. **Agent 2**: We allocate items where Agent 2 has relatively high valuations.
   - Item 4: Value 96 (already allocated to Agent 1, so we skip and choose another)
   - Item 5: Value 83
   - Item 7: Value 91 (already allocated to Agent 0, so we skip and choose another)
   - Item 6: Value 38

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 0, 7, 8
- **Agent 1**: 3, 4
- **Agent 2**: 1, 2, 5, 6

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and no more than 9 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```
