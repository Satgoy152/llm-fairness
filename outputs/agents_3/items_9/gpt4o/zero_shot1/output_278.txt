Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  48  51  40  44  20  81  59  87
1   3  57  43   6  85  21  33  25   4
2  81  97  89  91  12  76  45  40  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total value of items each agent can get if they were to receive all items. This gives us an idea of their preferences.
2. Assign items one by one, considering which item gives the most value to an agent relative to other agents.

First, let's look at the total value for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0: 443
- Agent 1: 277
- Agent 2: 564

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (81).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (97).
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most (89).
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (76).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (81).
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most (59).
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most (87).

Now we need to ensure a fair distribution by considering both the highest value and balancing the number of items:

- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 7, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Item [4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]

This ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated while maximizing the total value for each agent.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
