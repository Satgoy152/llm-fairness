Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  95  32  69  18  66  74  33  48
1  67  58  91  25  12  40  75  39   1
2  88   0  94  71  86  33   4  91   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 95 32 69 18 66 74 33 48]
 [67 58 91 25 12 40 75 39  1]
 [88  0 94 71 86 33  4 91  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method such as maximizing the total value assigned to each agent, or ensuring each agent gets a similar total valuation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Choose items that maximize their total value.
   - Assign items 0, 1, and 5 to Agent 0, as these have relatively high valuations for this agent.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Look for items that Agent 1 values highly and that aren't too highly valued by others.
   - Assign items 2, 6, and 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign the remaining items, considering their high valuations for Agent 2.
   - Assign items 3, 4, and 8 to Agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of total valuations based on their preferences.
