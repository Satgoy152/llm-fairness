Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  18  88  21  27  41  21  75  12
1  70  59  29  60   3  32  33  26  18
2   2   4  87  52  11   8  71  48  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can do this by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 at 70, and Agent 2 at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 at 59, and Agent 2 at 4. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 29, and Agent 2 at 87. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 60, and Agent 2 at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 3, and Agent 2 at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 32, and Agent 2 at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 33, and Agent 2 at 71. Assign to Agent 2.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 26, and Agent 2 at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 18, and Agent 2 at 18. Assign to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 8],
    "2": [6]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent given the constraints. Each agent receives at least one item, and in total, 9 items are allocated.
