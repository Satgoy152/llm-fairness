Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97   2  33  89  15   3  55  56  68
1  12  86  64  65  81   4  49  69  99
2   7  56  56  58  77  53   3  68  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 56 56 58 77 53  3 68 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can try to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent gets approximately 3 items (since 9 items divided by 3 agents equals 3 items per agent).

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by selecting the highest value item for each agent until each has 3 items, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Let's calculate this:

- Agent 0's highest values: 
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 8: 68

- Agent 1's highest values:
  - Item 8: 99
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 4: 81

- Agent 2's highest values:
  - Item 8: 91
  - Item 4: 77
  - Item 3: 58

To allocate fairly, we need to resolve conflicts over items:

- Item 8: Valued highest by Agent 1, so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Valued highest by Agent 0, so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Valued highest by Agent 1, so allocate to Agent 1.

Continue with the next highest available items:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 7: 56

- Agent 1:
  - Item 8: 99
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 4: 81

- Agent 2:
  - Item 6: 3
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 5: 53

Now, each agent has three items. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [8, 1, 4],
    "2": [6, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures a rough balance in the number of items allocated to each agent while attempting to maximize their valuations.
