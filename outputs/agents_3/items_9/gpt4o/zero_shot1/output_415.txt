Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  98  80  28  35  32  33  79  73
1  92  42  93   1  56  15   1  77  79
2  42  26  99  86  94  85  73  94  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that all items are distributed. We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no two agents receive the same item. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 0 values it at 73
   - Agent 2 values it at 42
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Agent 2 values it at 26
   - Assign to Agent 0

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Agent 0 values it at 80
   - Assign to Agent 2

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 86
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Assign to Agent 2

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Assign to Agent 2

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 85
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Assign to Agent 2

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Agent 0 values it at 33
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Assign to Agent 2

8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 2 values it at 94
   - Assign to Agent 2

9. **Item 8:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Agent 0 values it at 73
   - Agent 2 values it at 19
   - Assign to Agent 1

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, as Agent 0 currently has only one. We can adjust the assignments slightly to distribute the items more evenly without significantly reducing the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair number of items while maximizing their total valuation as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
