Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  47  64  22  67  96  52  36  41
1  79  30  86  30  95  94  43   1  73
2  94  44  97  40  49  63  63  87  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that balances these total values.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 59 + 47 + 64 + 22 + 67 + 96 + 52 + 36 + 41 = 484
- Agent 1: 79 + 30 + 86 + 30 + 95 + 94 + 43 + 1 + 73 = 531
- Agent 2: 94 + 44 + 97 + 40 + 49 + 63 + 63 + 87 + 65 = 602

Now, let's allocate the items to balance these total values as much as possible:

1. Assign the highest value items to the agent who values them the most but also consider balancing total values.
2. Keep track of the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 5 (96)
  - Item 2 (64)
  - Item 0 (59)
  
  Total value = 96 + 64 + 59 = 219

- Agent 1:
  - Item 4 (95)
  - Item 2 (86)
  - Item 8 (73)
  
  Total value = 95 + 86 + 73 = 254

- Agent 2:
  - Item 2 (97)
  - Item 7 (87)
  - Item 0 (94)

  Total value = 97 + 87 + 94 = 278

Now, let's finalize the allocation into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2, 0],
    "1": [4, 8, 2],
    "2": [7, 0, 2]
}
```

Please note that this allocation might not perfectly balance the perceived fairness, as such problems are often subject to different interpretations of fairness. However, this allocation attempts to balance the value distribution among the agents as much as possible.
