Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  11  19  25  71  98  27  82  93
1  28  43  47  55  40  92  82  91  83
2  50   2   2  85  37  31  36  58  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's distribute the items while considering each agent's highest valued items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4, 5, 7, and 8.
2. **Agent 1** values items 3, 5, 6, and 7 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly and has moderate valuations across other items.

Now, let's allocate the items step-by-step:

- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item the most (71). Assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values this item the most (92). Assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values this item the most (82). Assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values this item the most (93). Assign it to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values this item (82). Assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this item the most (85). Assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item (47). Assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item (43). Assign it to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item (50). Assign it to Agent 2.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 4, 7, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 5, 6, 2, 1
- Agent 2 gets items: 3, 0

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 2, 1],
    "2": [3, 0]
}
```
