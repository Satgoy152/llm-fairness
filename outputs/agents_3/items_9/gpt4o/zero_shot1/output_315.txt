Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  35  32  39  82  86  99  69  79
1  29  39  53   8  99  23  65  16  63
2  95  47  82  69  41  16  71  77  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 39 53  8 99 23 65 16 63]
 [95 47 82 69 41 16 71 77 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one approach to do this:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 6, 5, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4, 2, and 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 2, and 7.

Now, let's assign items to agents such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (highest valuation), and items 5 and 3 (next highest).
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (highest valuation), and items 1 and 2 (next highest).
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (highest valuation), and item 8 and 7 (next highest).

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, taking into account their preferences for the items. Now, letâ€™s present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 3],
    "1": [4, 1, 2],
    "2": [0, 8, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives three items, and all nine items are allocated among the agents.
