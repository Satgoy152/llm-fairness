Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  10  39  27  59  75  98  45  79
1  57  50  11  99  73  42  17  48  99
2  70  16  77  21  44  92   7   9   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction or valuation of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items.

Let's evaluate the valuation table and assign items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation, while keeping the number of items each agent receives balanced (3 items each, since there are 9 items and 3 agents).

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: 41, 10, 39, 27, 59, 75, 98, 45, 79
- Agent 1: 57, 50, 11, 99, 73, 42, 17, 48, 99
- Agent 2: 70, 16, 77, 21, 44, 92, 7, 9, 1

To allocate the items, we will:

1. Identify the highest value items for each agent.
2. Allocate one high-value item to each agent initially.
3. Continue balancing the allocation based on the next highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets 3 items.

### Allocation Steps:

1. Allocate the highest priority item for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (98)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (99)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (92)

2. Allocate the next highest items:
   - Agent 0: Item 8 (79)
   - Agent 1: Item 8 (99) - already taken by Agent 0, so next highest available is Item 4 (73)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (77)

3. Allocate one more item to each agent to ensure all 9 items are allocated:
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (75) - already taken by Agent 2, so next highest available is Item 4 (59)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (57)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (70) - already taken by Agent 1, so next highest available is Item 1 (16)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8, 4],
    "1": [3, 4, 0],
    "2": [5, 2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, with a focus on maximizing total valuation for each agent.
