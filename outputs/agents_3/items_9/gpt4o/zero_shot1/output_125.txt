Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  46  76  29  47  65  64  41  72
1  41   8  16  38  16  91  47  15  40
2  22  66  31  86  40  23  98  52  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value of the items each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives approximately equal numbers of items.

2. Ensure that no items are left unallocated.

Using this approach, let's go through the items:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2, 5, and 8.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 5 and 0.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 6, 3, and 7.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 8 (high values for these items)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 5 (high values for these items)
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 6, 7 (remaining items)

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6, 7]
}
```

Note: This allocation seeks to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering the values. There are other possible allocations, but this one strives for fairness given the constraints.
