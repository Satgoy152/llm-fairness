Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  87  47  32  52  38  40  15  50
1  90  34   3  85  44  40  73  90  74
2  63  29  20  51  60  80  90  28  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assess Valuation Priorities:**
   - Identify which items have the highest valuations for each agent.
   - Compare these valuations to determine where each item should be allocated to maximize overall happiness.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning items that have a clear highest value for one agent compared to others.
   - Avoid giving any agent too many high-value items unless necessary.

3. **Adjust Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent ends up with 3 items (since there are 9 items and 3 agents).
   - Check if allocations can be swapped to improve overall satisfaction without reducing any agent's allocation below 3 items.

Applying this approach to the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items [0, 1, 2] the most.
- Agent 1 values items [0, 3, 7] highly, but 0 is already better for Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values items [5, 6, 8] the most. 

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Assign items [0, 1, 8] to Agent 0.
- Assign items [3, 7, 4] to Agent 1.
- Assign items [5, 6, 2] to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and it maximizes each agent's total valuation to the extent possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 7, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 2]
}
```
