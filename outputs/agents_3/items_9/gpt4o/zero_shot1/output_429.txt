Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  80  52   3  71  44  30  70  28
1  44  68  67   8  86  49  79   7  12
2  93   0  41  27  91  89  99  23  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. One way to achieve this is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (80), so we can allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (86), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 highly (99), so we can allocate item 6 to agent 2.

Next, we continue allocating the remaining items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

4. Agent 2 values item 0 highly (93), so we can allocate item 0 to agent 2.
5. Agent 0 values item 5 highly (44), so we can allocate item 5 to agent 0.
6. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (67), so we can allocate item 2 to agent 1.
7. Agent 2 values item 3 highly (27), so we can allocate item 3 to agent 2.
8. Agent 0 values item 7 highly (70), so we can allocate item 7 to agent 0.
9. Agent 1 values item 8 (12) as the least valued item left, and they have space, so we allocate item 8 to agent 1.

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
