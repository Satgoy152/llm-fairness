Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  57  35  33  96  39   0  82   4
1   3  17  89  91  14  78  89  99  48
2  53  71  74  32  47  93  74  39   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This is a classic example of an optimization problem. Hereâ€™s one possible solution:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: 
   - Item 4: 96
   - Item 7: 82
   - Item 0: 58

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**:
   - Item 7: 99
   - Item 3: 91
   - Item 2: 89

3. **Agent 2's highest valuations**:
   - Item 5: 93
   - Item 2: 74
   - Item 6: 74
   
After analyzing these valuations, we need to ensure that items are fairly distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items that provide high value while ensuring no overlap with others.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items that are most valued by Agent 1 and not crucial to others.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items that are valuable but not overlapping with high-value items for other agents.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: [0, 4, 7]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: [5, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6, 8]
}
```
