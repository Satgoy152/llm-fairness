Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  80  42  29  93  28  70  52  69
1  53   2  30  86  26  64  12  99  11
2  52  13   5  68  48  48  48   5   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's consider the valuations and try to balance them.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [5, 80, 42, 29, 93, 28, 70, 52, 69]
- Agent 1: [53, 2, 30, 86, 26, 64, 12, 99, 11]
- Agent 2: [52, 13, 5, 68, 48, 48, 48, 5, 0]

We will allocate based on maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive.

1. Start by allocating the highest value items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 93.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the most at 99.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 68.

2. Allocate these items:
   - Agent 0 receives item 4.
   - Agent 1 receives item 7.
   - Agent 2 receives item 3.

3. Continue allocating remaining items based on each agent's next highest value:
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 1 (80), then item 6 (70), then item 8 (69).
   - Agent 1: Next highest is item 3 (86) but already taken, so item 5 (64), then item 0 (53).
   - Agent 2: Next highest is item 0 (52), then item 5 (48).

4. Allocate these remaining items:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1, 6, 8.
   - Agent 1 receives items 5, 0.
   - Agent 2 receives item 2.

Now, we check if all items are allocated:
- Items allocated: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] (all items are allocated)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
