Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45   5   3  68  52   4  15  13  28
1  47  30  77  58   0  28  85  54  98
2  23  68  42  31  17  83  48  28  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[45  5  3 68 52  4 15 13 28]
 [47 30 77 58  0 28 85 54 98]
 [23 68 42 31 17 83 48 28 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they get. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (68), so we allocate this item to Agent 0.
   - Next best value for Agent 0 is item 4 (52), so we allocate this item as well.
   - Finally, allocate item 0 (45) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the most (98), so we allocate this item to Agent 1.
   - Next best value for Agent 1 is item 2 (77), so we allocate this item as well.
   - Finally, allocate item 6 (85) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (83), so we allocate this item to Agent 2.
   - Next best value for Agent 2 is item 1 (68), so we allocate this item as well.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations. Here's the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [1, 5]
}
```
