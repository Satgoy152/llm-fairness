Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  50  41  59  35  48  72  32  52
1  36  74  41  77  35  45  41  25  30
2  32  88  51  16  54  78  39  84  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent gets if all items are distributed optimally.
2. Allocate items to maximize the fairness of the distribution.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

- **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 highly.
- **Agent 2** values items 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 highly.

Given these considerations, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Get items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: Get items [1]
- Agent 2: Get items [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, given the constraints of the problem.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
