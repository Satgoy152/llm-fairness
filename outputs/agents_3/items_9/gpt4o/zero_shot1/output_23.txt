Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  23  38  38  82   0  13  14   8
1  78  21  56  34  88   0  33   8  76
2  14  87  55  46  44  97  50  52  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. One possible strategy is to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their total possible valuation.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 24 + 23 + 38 + 38 + 82 + 0 + 13 + 14 + 8 = 240
- Agent 1: 78 + 21 + 56 + 34 + 88 + 0 + 33 + 8 + 76 = 394
- Agent 2: 14 + 87 + 55 + 46 + 44 + 97 + 50 + 52 + 84 = 529

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring the total number of items assigned is 9.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 1 (78)
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 2 (87)
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 1 (56)
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 2 (46)
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 1 (88)
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 2 (97)
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 2 (50)
- Item 7: Assigned to Agent 2 (52)
- Item 8: Assigned to Agent 1 (76)

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while distributing the total valuations fairly among the agents.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]
}
```

Agent 0 receives no items, Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 4, and 8, and Agent 2 receives items 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. This allocation distributes all 9 items fairly based on the agents' valuations.
