Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  60  84  21  70  61   2   7  30
1  33  98  88  17  99  25   6  47  66
2  45  57  74  46  11  34  75  87  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations. We will consider each agent's highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet and assign it to them. We will iterate through the list until all items are allocated.

First, let's order the items based on the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 2 (84)
  - Item 4 (70)
  - Item 1 (60)
  - Item 5 (61)
  - Item 0 (24)
  - Item 3 (21)
  - Item 8 (30)
  - Item 7 (7)
  - Item 6 (2)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 4 (99)
  - Item 1 (98)
  - Item 2 (88)
  - Item 8 (66)
  - Item 7 (47)
  - Item 5 (25)
  - Item 0 (33)
  - Item 3 (17)
  - Item 6 (6)

- Agent 2:
  - Item 7 (87)
  - Item 6 (75)
  - Item 2 (74)
  - Item 0 (45)
  - Item 3 (46)
  - Item 1 (57)
  - Item 5 (34)
  - Item 4 (11)
  - Item 8 (10)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
2. Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation for Agent 1).
5. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for Agent 2).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for Agent 0).
7. Assign Item 8 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation for Agent 1).
8. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for Agent 2).
9. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for Agent 0).

The allocation is done by ensuring each agent gets items based on their preferences until all items are allocated. The result is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 3],
    "1": [4, 1, 8],
    "2": [7, 6, 0]
}
```
