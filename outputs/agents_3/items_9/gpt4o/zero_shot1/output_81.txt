Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  20  96  26  60  76  75  41  28
1  20  44  72  45  64  10  55   3  25
2  75  73   0  99  89  95  19  71  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 9. We aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's consider a simple approach where we assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent initially, and adjust as needed to ensure all items are allocated.

Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (96), 5 (76), 6 (75)
   - Allocate items 2, 5, and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (64), 2 (72), 3 (45)
   - Item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, so consider next highest: item 1 (44)
   - Allocate items 4, 3, and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 3 (99), 5 (95), 4 (89)
   - Items 3, 5, and 4 are already allocated, so consider next highest: item 0 (75)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

Now let's check if all items are allocated:

- Allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Remaining items: 7, 8

4. Allocate remaining items:
   - Agent 2 has fewer items, so allocate items 7 and 8 to Agent 2.

Revised allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 3, 1]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 7, 8]

Final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 3, 1],
    "2": [0, 7, 8]
}
```
