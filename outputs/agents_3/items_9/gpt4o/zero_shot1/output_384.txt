Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  44  89  15  16  73   6  61  10
1  42  44  72  30  80  36  36  76  45
2  16  41  55  28  52  25  50  70  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the item valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 71, Item 1: 44, Item 2: 89, Item 3: 15, Item 4: 16, Item 5: 73, Item 6: 6, Item 7: 61, Item 8: 10

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 42, Item 1: 44, Item 2: 72, Item 3: 30, Item 4: 80, Item 5: 36, Item 6: 36, Item 7: 76, Item 8: 45

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 16, Item 1: 41, Item 2: 55, Item 3: 28, Item 4: 52, Item 5: 25, Item 6: 50, Item 7: 70, Item 8: 82

We need to allocate these items so each agent receives a fair share. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation an agent has for an item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items they highly value like items 2, 5, and 0.
- Agent 1: Assign items like 4, 7, and 8, where they have relatively high valuations.
- Agent 2: Assign items like 6, 3, and 1, where they have a decent valuation.

After assigning these items, we confirm that all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 0],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [6, 3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair and integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
