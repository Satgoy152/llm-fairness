Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  33  87  69  53  87  32  63  64
1  67  67   4  97   5   1  77  79  84
2  23  82  22  75   9   4  41  73  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive each item.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and all agents get approximately equal numbers of items.

Let's consider the allocations:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2, 5, and 3.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 3, 8, and 1.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 1, 8, and 3.

We can allocate the items as follows to ensure a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
2. Agent 1: Items 3, 7, 8
3. Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 6

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, maximizing their valuations based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
