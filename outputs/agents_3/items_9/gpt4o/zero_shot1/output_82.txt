Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  16  85   4  93  22  59  30  31
1  81  61  19  28  88  77  40  72  80
2  87  25  80  20  56  53  38   6  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

Let's go through the steps:

- Agent 0's total value: 50 + 16 + 85 + 4 + 93 + 22 + 59 + 30 + 31 = 390
- Agent 1's total value: 81 + 61 + 19 + 28 + 88 + 77 + 40 + 72 + 80 = 546
- Agent 2's total value: 87 + 25 + 80 + 20 + 56 + 53 + 38 + 6 + 83 = 448

Now, let's allocate items based on the highest value for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (87)
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (61)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (85)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (28)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (93)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (77)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (59)
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (72)
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most (83)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and adjust the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 8

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 8]
}
```
