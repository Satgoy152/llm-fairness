Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  38  90  33  18  79   1  34  31
1  33  69  30  65  35   8  15  83  38
2  65  88  50  94  95  18  93  68  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item for each agent, and aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value.
2. Allocate 3 items to each agent, since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items: 2 (90), 5 (79), and 1 (38).
- Agent 1 has relatively high valuations for items: 7 (83), 3 (65), and 1 (69).
- Agent 2 has relatively high valuations for items: 4 (95), 3 (94), and 0 (65).

Given this, we can proceed with the allocation:

- Assign items 2, 5, and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 7, 3, and 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 4, 0, and 8 to Agent 2.

This allocation provides a relatively balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 1],
    "1": [7, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 0, 8]
}
```
