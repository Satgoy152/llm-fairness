Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19   3  93  43  46  65  76  24  74
1  38   9  63  10  28  47  69  77  24
2  16  78  25  86  72   1   3  17  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives a roughly equal total valuation, if possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to balance the total valuation across agents by assigning items that maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Let's calculate the total valuation:

- Agent 0: 19 + 3 + 93 + 43 + 46 + 65 + 76 + 24 + 74 = 443
- Agent 1: 38 + 9 + 63 + 10 + 28 + 47 + 69 + 77 + 24 = 365
- Agent 2: 16 + 78 + 25 + 86 + 72 + 1 + 3 + 17 + 10 = 308

Now, let's allocate items to balance the total value as much as possible across the agents:

1. Allocate high-value items to agents who have lower total valuations.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4, 5] (Total value = 93 + 46 + 65 = 204)
- Agent 1: Items [6, 7, 8] (Total value = 69 + 77 + 24 = 170)
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1, 3] (Total value = 16 + 78 + 86 = 180)

This allocation balances the distribution of value fairly across the agents.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
