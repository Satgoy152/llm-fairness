Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  18  35  73  62  45  39  21  29
1  52  70  26  74  89  56  15  79  71
2  80  95  82  12  17  36  33  62  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's begin by considering each agent's total valuation and attempt to distribute the items in a balanced manner:

Agent 0's Valuations:
- Items: 0 (0), 1 (18), 2 (35), 3 (73), 4 (62), 5 (45), 6 (39), 7 (21), 8 (29)

Agent 1's Valuations:
- Items: 0 (52), 1 (70), 2 (26), 3 (74), 4 (89), 5 (56), 6 (15), 7 (79), 8 (71)

Agent 2's Valuations:
- Items: 0 (80), 1 (95), 2 (82), 3 (12), 4 (17), 5 (36), 6 (33), 7 (62), 8 (79)

To achieve a fair allocation, we'll use a heuristic approach to balance the total values:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values relatively high compared to other agents.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with high values for Agent 2.

### Step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest (80).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest (95).
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest (82).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest (74).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (89).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest (56).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (39).
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the highest (79).
- **Item 8**: Agent 2 values it the highest (79).

Each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Agent 0 receives 1 item, Agent 1 receives 4 items, and Agent 2 receives 4 items, making a total of 9 items allocated.
