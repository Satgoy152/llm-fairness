Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82   1  67  13  99  84  38  39  19
1  95  71  71   9   9  42  67  96  85
2  72  90  98  11  97  86  16  20  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that distributes the items based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items and allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents to attempt to balance the total valuation each receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 82 (Item 0) + 1 (Item 1) + 67 (Item 2) + 13 (Item 3) + 99 (Item 4) + 84 (Item 5) + 38 (Item 6) + 39 (Item 7) + 19 (Item 8) = 442
- Agent 1: 95 (Item 0) + 71 (Item 1) + 71 (Item 2) + 9 (Item 3) + 9 (Item 4) + 42 (Item 5) + 67 (Item 6) + 96 (Item 7) + 85 (Item 8) = 545
- Agent 2: 72 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 1) + 98 (Item 2) + 11 (Item 3) + 97 (Item 4) + 86 (Item 5) + 16 (Item 6) + 20 (Item 7) + 61 (Item 8) = 551

Now, let's allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for a given item, ensuring each agent gets some fair share of total possible value:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (95), Item 1 to Agent 2 (90), Item 2 to Agent 2 (98).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (13), Item 4 to Agent 0 (99), Item 5 to Agent 2 (86).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (67), Item 7 to Agent 1 (96), Item 8 to Agent 1 (85).

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 2 receives items: 1, 2, 5

This distribution aims to fairly share the total value among the agents based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 6, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 5]
}
```
