Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  58  15  54   7   3  77   7   9
1  71  65   1  53   5  40  91  31   5
2   3  71  63  68  77  76  96   4  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the valuations and try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (77), Item 1 (58), Item 3 (54)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (91), Item 0 (71), Item 1 (65)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (96), Item 8 (83), Item 4 (77), Item 5 (76)

Let's prioritize the allocation based on the highest valuations:

- **Item 6** has the highest value for Agent 2. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** has a high value for Agent 0. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 8** has a high value for Agent 2. Allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3** is valuable to Agent 0. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4** is valuable to Agent 2. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Item 5** is valuable to Agent 2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 2. However, to ensure fairness and integer allocation, let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 needs more items.
- **Item 7** can be allocated to Agent 1.

In this allocation, each agent gets at least two items, ensuring fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 8, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed fairly among the agents, maximizing total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
