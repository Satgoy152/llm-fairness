Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65   1  16  61  78  89  11  53  11
1  46  21   5  50  93  99  90  24  70
2  74  69   3  96  52  66  56  72  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Valuations: [65, 1, 16, 61, 78, 89, 11, 53, 11]
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 5 (89), Item 4 (78), Item 3 (61)

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Valuations: [46, 21, 5, 50, 93, 99, 90, 24, 70]
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 5 (99), Item 4 (93), Item 6 (90)

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Valuations: [74, 69, 3, 96, 52, 66, 56, 72, 85]
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 3 (96), Item 8 (85), Item 0 (74)

Now, I need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. The allocation should be balanced and optimized for the agents' preferences:

- Assign item 5 to agent 1 since they value it the highest.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 since they also have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 since they value it the highest.
- Assign item 8 to agent 2 since they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 0 to agent 2 since they still have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 for their third-highest preference.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 as it has not been taken yet.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to agent 0.

Here's the balanced allocation based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets three items.
