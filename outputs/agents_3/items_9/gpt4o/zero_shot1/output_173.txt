Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  22   4   2   5   3  60   2  11
1  83  71  67  67  56  51  96  55  29
2  70  95  76  21  82  76  11   9  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 95 76 21 82 76 11  9 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that balances the total value across agents.

Let's evaluate a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest-valued items: 0 (64), 6 (60)
   - Allocate items: [0, 6]

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest-valued items: 6 (96), 0 (83), 1 (71), 2 (67), 3 (67)
   - Allocate items: [1, 2, 3]

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest-valued items: 1 (95), 4 (82), 5 (76)
   - Allocate items: [4, 5, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while also ensuring all items are distributed.

Now, let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of distributing all 9 items among the 3 agents based on the provided valuations.
