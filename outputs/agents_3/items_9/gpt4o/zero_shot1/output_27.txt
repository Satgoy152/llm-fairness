Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  90  59  10   2  21  60  80  44
1  60  18  46  14  23  33  39  84  50
2  42  92  86  99  12  36  24  11  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with the allocation, maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values: [37, 90, 59, 10, 2, 21, 60, 80, 44]
   - High-value items: 1 (90), 7 (80), 6 (60)

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [60, 18, 46, 14, 23, 33, 39, 84, 50]
   - High-value items: 0 (60), 7 (84), 2 (46)

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [42, 92, 86, 99, 12, 36, 24, 11, 36]
   - High-value items: 3 (99), 1 (92), 2 (86)

Let's try to allocate these items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: Assign items 1, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1: Assign items 0, 2, and 8.
- Agent 2: Assign items 3, 4, and 5.

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives an approximately equal number of items.
- Each agent gets items that are relatively high in value for them.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items and attempts to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
