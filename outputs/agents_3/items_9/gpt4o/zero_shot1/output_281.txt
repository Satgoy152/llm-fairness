Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  66  84  37   9  26  10  31  40
1  58  28  68  87   9  94  96  98  36
2   1  34  28  95  11   4  53  79  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[13 66 84 37  9 26 10 31 40]
 [58 28 68 87  9 94 96 98 36]
 [ 1 34 28 95 11  4 53 79 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  66  84  37   9  26  10  31  40
1  58  28  68  87   9  94  96  98  36
2   1  34  28  95  11   4  53  79  70
```

We will implement a strategy to allocate items, considering the highest valuations first and ensuring a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations for items 7 (98), 6 (96), and 5 (94).
2. **Agent 0:** Next, highest remaining valuations for items 2 (84), 1 (66), and 8 (40).
3. **Agent 2:** Remaining items with highest valuations for agent 2 are 3 (95), and 8 (70).

Now, assign items:

- **Agent 1** will get items [5, 6, 7] because they have the highest valuations for those items.
- **Agent 0** will get items [0, 1, 2] because they have the next highest valuations for those items among the remaining.
- **Agent 2** will get items [3, 4, 8] because they have the highest valuations for those remaining items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, maximizing each agent's total valuations.
