Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  99  86   4  51  98  51  63  32
1   3  17  63  13   9  75  72  19  18
2  99   9  97  66   6  13  46  19  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute them such that each agent's total valuation is balanced, while ensuring that each agent receives a whole number of items. Let's consider each agent's preferences and valuations for the items:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 5 (98), Item 2 (86)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 0 (27), Item 4 (51), Item 6 (51), Item 7 (63)
   - Low valuations: Item 3 (4), Item 8 (32)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 5 (75), Item 6 (72), Item 2 (63)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 7 (19), Item 8 (18), Item 1 (17)
   - Low valuations: Item 3 (13), Item 4 (9), Item 0 (3)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations:**
   - High valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (97), Item 3 (66)
   - Moderate valuations: Item 8 (50), Item 6 (46), Item 7 (19)
   - Low valuations: Item 1 (9), Item 5 (13), Item 4 (6)

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the total valuations as evenly as possible:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 5 (98)
  - Allocate moderate valuation item: Item 4 (51)
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 5 (75), Item 6 (72)
  - Allocate moderate valuation item: Item 7 (19)

- **Agent 2:**
  - Allocate items with high valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (97), Item 3 (66)

After considering the above allocations, we need to ensure that 9 items are allocated in total. Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 4],
    "1": [6, 7, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the distribution of high-value items is relatively balanced among the agents.
