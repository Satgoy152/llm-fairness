Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  75  64  27  32  40   0  31  25
1  53  25   2   4  96   4  67  17  45
2  51  30  54  86  98  23   4  17  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 75 64 27 32 40  0 31 25]

 [51 30 54 86 98 23  4 17 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple max-sum allocation strategy. This involves iteratively assigning the items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least some items and all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 at 53, Agent 2 at 51.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 25, Agent 2 at 30.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 2, Agent 2 at 54.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 4, Agent 2 at 86.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 at 96, Agent 2 at 98.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 at 4, Agent 2 at 23.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 at 67, Agent 2 at 4.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 at 17, Agent 2 at 17.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 at 45, Agent 2 at 87.
   - Assign to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 4, 8]
}
```
