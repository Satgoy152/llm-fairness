Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  65  66  58  97  40  54  24  85
1  83  60  38  33  71  68  77  50  69
2  25   8  76  89  64  90  21  17   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 65 66 58 97 40 54 24 85]
 [83 60 38 33 71 68 77 50 69]
 [25  8 76 89 64 90 21 17  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that considers the total value each agent places on the items. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents, ideally giving each agent the items they value most while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4, 2, and 8 (97, 66, and 85 respectively).

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 5 (83, 77, and 68 respectively).

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5, 3, and 2 (90, 89, and 76 respectively).

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 4, 2, and 8. These are among the highest valued items for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items 0, 6, and 5. These items are highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items 3, 1, and 7. These items are left and have relatively higher values for Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, which is fair given there are 9 items total and 3 agents.
