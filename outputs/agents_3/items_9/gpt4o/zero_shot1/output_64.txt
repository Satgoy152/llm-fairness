Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  32  77  90  64  33  71  98  39
1  19  89  23  40  78  53  80  79  39
2  10  58   2  61   7  95  80  53  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to distribute the items so that each agent is satisfied according to their preferences. However, since the problem doesn't specify a specific fairness criterion, such as maximizing total valuation or ensuring a minimum valuation for each agent, I will aim to distribute the items fairly based on a simple method of maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy:

1. Each agent should receive an approximately equal share of the total valuation based on their top preferences.
2. Aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest valuations are for items 7 (98), 3 (90), and 2 (77).
- Agent 1: Highest valuations are for items 1 (89), 4 (78), and 6 (80).
- Agent 2: Highest valuations are for items 5 (95), 3 (61), and 8 (65).

Allocating based on these observations:

1. Assign items 7, 0, and 2 to Agent 0.
2. Assign items 1, 4, and 6 to Agent 1.
3. Assign items 5, 3, and 8 to Agent 2.

This ensures each agent gets their highest valued items while keeping the distribution fair. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [5, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent three items and the sum of valuations for each agent is relatively balanced.
