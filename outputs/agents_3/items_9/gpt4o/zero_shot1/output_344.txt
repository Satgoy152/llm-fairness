Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  61  47  81  23  18  63  16  10
1  82  93  21  16  85  31  28   0   2
2  76  49  92  87  91  46  31  27  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach where we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately equal number of items, while considering their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 1, and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 0, and 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.

Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should get 3 items.

Here's a possible allocation, considering the goal of maximizing total valuation for each agent while giving each agent an equal number of items:

1. Assign items to Agent 0:
   - Item 3 (valuation 81)
   - Item 1 (valuation 61)
   - Item 6 (valuation 63)

2. Assign items to Agent 1:
   - Item 0 (valuation 82)
   - Item 4 (valuation 85)
   - Item 5 (valuation 31)

3. Assign items to Agent 2:
   - Item 2 (valuation 92)
   - Item 7 (valuation 27)
   - Item 8 (valuation 79)

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets 3 items. Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and all 9 items are distributed.
