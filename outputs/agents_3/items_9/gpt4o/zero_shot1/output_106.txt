Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  78  64  36  57  97  10  92  59
1   6  82  23  72  44  63   7  55  24
2  54  51  39  77  60  20  75  29  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. This can be achieved by considering each agent's preferences and attempting to distribute items so that no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items with high values unique to each agent.
2. Distribute remaining items to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 8.

Next, distribute remaining items to balance the total values:

- Agent 0: Add items 7 and 4, as they are also highly valued by Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Add items 1 and 0, as they are highly valued by Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Add items 2 and 6, as they are highly valued by Agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 0],
    "2": [8, 2, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives 3 items, and every item is allocated. This distribution attempts to consider each agent's preferences and distribute the value fairly.
