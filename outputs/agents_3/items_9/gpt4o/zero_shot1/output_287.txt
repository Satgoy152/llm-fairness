Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75   5  20  62  97  51  48   5   5
1  23   2  74  52  31  68   7  28  20
2  46  84  93  72  59  45  86  67  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (97), item 3 (62), and item 0 (75). 
   - Assign these high-value items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (74) and item 5 (68).
   - Assign these items to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 highly values item 1 (84), item 6 (86), and item 7 (67).
   - Assign these items to agent 2.

4. **Remaining item**:
   - Item 8 is valued as follows: agent 0: 5, agent 1: 20, agent 2: 39.
   - Assign item 8 to agent 2, as they value it the most.

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a set of items they value highly.
