Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  98  40   8  67  43  64  35  11
1  76  65   8  92  11  32  53  46  52
2  55  97  71  67   4  52  10  71   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[19 98 40  8 67 43 64 35 11]
 [76 65  8 92 11 32 53 46 52]
 [55 97 71 67  4 52 10 71  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (19), Item 6 (64)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 0 (76), Item 1 (65)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 2 (71), Item 7 (71)

We'll try to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring no overlap and each agent receives 3 items.

### Allocation Plan

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 1 (98)
  - Item 6 (64)
  - Item 0 (19)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 3 (92)
  - Item 4 (11)
  - Item 5 (32)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 2 (71)
  - Item 7 (71)
  - Item 8 (5)

This allocation considers the highest valuations and ensures each agent receives 3 items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 8]
}
```
