Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  60  91  32  19   7   3  62  13
1  11  64  21  41   6  58  87  86  60
2   6  62  32  27  90  50  93  76   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 60 91 32 19  7  3 62 13]
 [11 64 21 41  6 58 87 86 60]
 [ 6 62 32 27 90 50 93 76  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent has a relatively balanced share based on their preferences.

Let's go through the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [39, 60, 91, 32, 19,  7,  3, 62, 13]
Agent 1: [11, 64, 21, 41,  6, 58, 87, 86, 60]
Agent 2: [ 6, 62, 32, 27, 90, 50, 93, 76,  8]
```

We will try to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 7 (62), Item 1 (60)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (87), Item 7 (86), Item 5 (58)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (93), Item 4 (90), Item 7 (76)

We need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items, considering their highest valued items first:

- Start by assigning each agent their highest preferred item if possible:
  - Agent 0 gets Item 2 (91)
  - Agent 1 gets Item 6 (87)
  - Agent 2 gets Item 4 (90)

- Continue allocating the next highest available items:
  - Agent 0 gets Item 1 (60)
  - Agent 1 gets Item 7 (86)
  - Agent 2 gets Item 5 (50)

- Allocate remaining items while maintaining balance:
  - Agent 0 gets Item 0 (39)
  - Agent 1 gets Item 3 (41)
  - Agent 2 gets Item 8 (8)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 0],
    "1": [6, 7, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences as fairly as possible given the constraints.
