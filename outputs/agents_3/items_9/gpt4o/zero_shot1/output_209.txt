Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96   0   9  36  58  18   9  40  97
1  33  17  32  52  23  96  39  59  35
2  20  56  84  19  90  97  44  21  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96  0  9 36 58 18  9 40 97]
 [33 17 32 52 23 96 39 59 35]
 [20 56 84 19 90 97 44 21 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their total valuation. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valued item: Item 8 (value 97)
    - Next highest: Item 0 (value 96)
    - Next highest: Item 4 (value 58)

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest valued item: Item 5 (value 96)
    - Next highest: Item 3 (value 52)
    - Next highest: Item 7 (value 59)

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest valued item: Item 6 (value 44)
    - Next highest: Item 2 (value 84)
    - Next highest: Item 1 (value 56)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items, and each item is allocated to exactly one agent, maintaining a fair distribution based on their valuations. Here are the allocations presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
