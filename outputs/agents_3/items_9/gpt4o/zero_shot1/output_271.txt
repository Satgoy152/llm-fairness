Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  98  87  52   6  91  49  55  23
1  12  94  80  91  71   4  70  51  96
2  49  28  74  15  47  83  44  71  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Sort the items based on each agent's preference and allocate them to maximize the total value.

Let's assign the items:

- Agent 0: Receives items 0, 5, and 1 (valuations: 71, 91, 98)
- Agent 1: Receives items 4, 3, and 8 (valuations: 71, 91, 96)
- Agent 2: Receives items 6, 7, and 2 (valuations: 44, 71, 74)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items, and all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 3, 8],
    "2": [6, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to balance the distribution of items in a way that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an equal number of items.
