Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  61  48  10  12  35  94  47  43
1  80  35  22  36  26  70  64  21  94
2  56  56  35  71   3  70   2   0  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (80).
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (61).
   
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (48).
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most (71).
   
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (26).
   
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Both Agents 1 and 2 have the highest valuation (70). To balance allocations, give it to Agent 2 (as Agent 1 already has 2 items).
   
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (94).
   
8. **Item 7**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (47).
   
9. **Item 8**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (94).

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4, 8
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
