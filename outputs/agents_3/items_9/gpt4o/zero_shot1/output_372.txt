Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  58  76  95   2  47  49  49  30
1  74  52  60  21  64  31  34  23  83
2  40   3  23  94   1  70  95  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40  3 23 94  1 70 95 45 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items valued relatively high by them, while also ensuring all items are distributed and each agent gets at least some items. We have 9 items and 3 agents, so ideally each agent should get 3 items to ensure fairness in terms of quantity.

Let's evaluate the best allocation of items:

1. **Agent 0's top-valued items:**
   - Item 3: 95
   - Item 2: 76
   - Item 0: 65

2. **Agent 1's top-valued items:**
   - Item 8: 83
   - Item 0: 74 (already selected by Agent 0, next best)
   - Item 4: 64

3. **Agent 2's top-valued items:**
   - Item 6: 95
   - Item 3: 94 (already selected by Agent 0, next best)
   - Item 5: 70

Allocate the items based on these priorities and ensure no item is allocated to more than one agent:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items 3, 2, and 1
- **Agent 1:** Assign items 8, 4, and 0
- **Agent 2:** Assign items 6, 5, and 7

This allocation gives each agent 3 items each, fairly based on their top preferences, and ensures all items are allocated.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 1],
    "1": [8, 4, 0],
    "2": [6, 5, 7]
}
```
