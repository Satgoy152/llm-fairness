Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  61  97  18  54  81  38  90  60
1  75  82  62  29  55  27  37  98  45
2  79  43   0  25  92  27  68  45   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 61 97 18 54 81 38 90 60]
 [75 82 62 29 55 27 37 98 45]
 [79 43  0 25 92 27 68 45  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for some potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with high valuation: 2 (97), 7 (90), 5 (81)
   - Allocation: [2, 7, 5]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items with high valuation: 7 (98), 1 (82), 0 (75)
   - Allocation: [1, 0]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items with high valuation: 4 (92), 6 (68), 0 (79)
   - Allocation: [4, 6, 3, 8]

Now, let's check if the allocations are fair and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 7, 5
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 0
- Agent 2 receives items: 4, 6, 3, 8

Total items allocated: 9 (which matches the total number of items available)

The allocation is fairly distributed, with each agent receiving items based on their preferences and all items being allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4, 6, 3, 8]
}
```
