Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  64  92  29  68  73  13  24  97
1  69  35  90  62  73  30  92  22  43
2   3  83  90  25  44  90  98  14  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. One such approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List all items with their highest value and corresponding agent:**
   - Item 0 is valued highest by agent 0 (70).
   - Item 1 is valued highest by agent 2 (83).
   - Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (92).
   - Item 3 is valued highest by agent 1 (62).
   - Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (73).
   - Item 5 is valued highest by agent 2 (90).
   - Item 6 is valued highest by agent 2 (98).
   - Item 7 is valued highest by agent 0 (24).
   - Item 8 is valued highest by agent 0 (97).

2. **Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation:**
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 7 to agent 0.
   - Assign item 8 to agent 0.

3. **Ensure each agent has at least one item and adjust if necessary:**
   - Agent 0 has items [0, 2, 7, 8].
   - Agent 1 has items [3, 4].
   - Agent 2 has items [1, 5, 6].

The allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```
