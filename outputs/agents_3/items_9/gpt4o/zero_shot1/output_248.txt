Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  90  10  31  45   6  78  56  46
1  53  21  27  35  98  63  30  83  34
2  56   8  63  89  58  86   4  90  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that considers the preferences or values the agents have for the items, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Items: 0, 1, 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Items: 4, 7, 2

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Items: 3, 5, 8

With this allocation, each agent gets 3 items, which is fair given there are 9 items in total to be allocated among 3 agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 7, 2],
    "2": [3, 5, 8]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, making the distribution as fair as possible given the constraints.
