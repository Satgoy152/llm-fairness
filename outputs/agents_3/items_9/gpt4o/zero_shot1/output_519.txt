Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  55  60   6  52  74  54  91  10
1  55  66  93  80  55  87  77   5  28
2  41  93  37  63  66  70   1  33  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 7, 5, and 2 as these have the highest values for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 2 and 5 after considering that agent 1 values item 2 the highest and item 5 second highest.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items 1 and 4 as these are valued the highest by agent 2.

After evaluating the preferences and ensuring each agent gets a fair share, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 7, 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 8
- Agent 2: Items 1, 0, 4, 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 8],
    "2": [1, 0, 4, 6]
}
```
