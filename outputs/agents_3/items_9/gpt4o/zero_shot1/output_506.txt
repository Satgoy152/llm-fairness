Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  13  69  62  86  27  10  34  55
1  46  47  46  93  55  67  85  58  41
2  80  53  43  16  91   5  86   4  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 13 69 62 86 27 10 34 55]
 [46 47 46 93 55 67 85 58 41]
 [80 53 43 16 91  5 86  4 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets approximately equal numbers of items. This could mean each agent should get 3 items since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will allocate items that provide relatively high value to this agent. Looking at the valuations, items 2, 4, and 3 have high values for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, we will allocate items that maximize value for agent 1. Items 3, 6, and 5 provide high values for agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Finally, we allocate the remaining items to agent 2. Items 0, 4, and 6 offer high values for agent 2.

By checking the mutual exclusivity and high valuation strategy, we might adjust slightly to ensure fairness:

**Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [2, 4, 0]
- Agent 1: [3, 6, 5]
- Agent 2: [1, 7, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent gets three items and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 0],
    "1": [3, 6, 5],
    "2": [1, 7, 8]
}
```
