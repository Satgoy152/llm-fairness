Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  96  67  97  67  47  54  53   6
1  44  41  18  22  38  28  55  30  21
2  88  83  40  37  43  19   9  51  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can focus on maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We also want to ensure all 9 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** This agent has high valuations for several items, and we should aim to allocate items that maximize their total value.
2. **Agent 1:** This agent generally has lower valuations, so we should aim to allocate items that are less valued by other agents.
3. **Agent 2:** This agent has high valuations for some items but lower for others, similar to Agent 0.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation from Agent 2 (88), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation from Agent 0 (96), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation from Agent 0 (67), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation from Agent 0 (97), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation from Agent 0 (67), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Moderate valuation from Agent 0 (47), lower from others, allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation from Agent 1 (55), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 7:** Highest valuation from Agent 2 (51), so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 8:** Moderate valuation from Agent 2 (48), lower from others, allocate to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with all 9 items allocated.
