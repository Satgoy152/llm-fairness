Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  72  63  42  50  72  37  75  81
1  34  17  12  25   5  91  20  35  77
2  44  51  50  57   8   4  38  76  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with relatively high total value based on their individual valuations. We will aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations: Items 0 (58), 1 (72), 5 (72), 7 (75), 8 (81)
   - Let's allocate items 1, 7, and 8 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 72 + 75 + 81 = 228.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations: Items 5 (91), 8 (77)
   - Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total value of 91.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations: Items 3 (57), 7 (76)
   - Let's allocate items 3, 2, and 6 to Agent 2. This gives Agent 2 a total value of 57 + 50 + 38 = 145.

Now let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Items 0, 4 are yet to be allocated.

Since Agent 0 already has a high total value, let's allocate one more item to Agent 1 and Agent 2:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1. New total for Agent 1: 91 + 34 = 125.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2. New total for Agent 2: 145 + 8 = 153.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 2, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
