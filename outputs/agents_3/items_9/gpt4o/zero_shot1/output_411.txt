Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  79  70  58   1  98  55  29  41
1   8  37  22  58  61  24  36  54  95
2  93  81  71  25  42  43  22  56  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 81 71 25 42 43 22 56 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. We will strive to allocate items such that every agent gets a roughly equal number of items and, if possible, with the highest valuation for each.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by allocating items where Agent 0 has high valuations.
   - Item 5 (98), Item 1 (79)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items with high valuation for Agent 1.
   - Item 8 (95), Item 4 (61), Item 3 (58)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate remaining items where Agent 2 has high valuations.
   - Item 0 (93), Item 2 (71), Item 7 (56), Item 6 (22)

Now, let's ensure that the total number of allocated items is 9 and that each agent gets a fair allocation. Adjusting for fairness:

- **Agent 0**: [5, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [8, 4, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 2, 7, 6]

This allocation respects the constraints of fairness and maximizes the value for each agent based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [8, 4, 3],
    "2": [0, 2, 7, 6]
}
```
