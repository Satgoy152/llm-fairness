Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  64   8   5  57  14  69  80  67
1  24  21  77  98  38  86  88  74  78
2  94  75   9  51  31  33  33  91  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 3 agents, I will use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This involves ensuring that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items while trying to distribute items in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We'll start by looking at the highest values for Agent 0 across all items. The top three values are for items 7 (80), 6 (69), and 8 (67).

2. **Agent 1**: For Agent 1, the highest values are for items 3 (98), 6 (88), and 5 (86). However, since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, we will select the next highest value, which is item 8 (78).

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2's highest values are for items 0 (94), 8 (84), and 7 (91). Items 7 and 8 are already allocated, so we will assign items 0 and 2 (9) to Agent 2.

Now, let's finalize the allocation ensuring each agent gets 3 items since there are 9 items in total:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items are 7 (80), 6 (69), and 8 (67).
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items are 3 (98), 5 (86), and 1 (21).
- **Agent 2**: Allocated items are 0 (94), 2 (9), and 4 (31).

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and the allocation is done in a way that each agent receives a high-value set of items based on their individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 1],
    "2": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
