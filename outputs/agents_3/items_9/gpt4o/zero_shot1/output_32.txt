Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  93   4  21  36  50  55  73  31
1  32  97  14  37   4  58  97  37  81
2  59  20  15  18  36  49  77   5  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach like the round-robin method or another balanced method to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's consider allocating items to maximize the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most and allocate it to that agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure fairness in the number of items each agent receives.

Following this approach:

- **Step 1**: Allocate the highest valued items to each agent:
  - Item 1 (highest value 97, agent 1)
  - Item 6 (highest value 97, agent 1)
  - Item 8 (highest value 87, agent 2)
  - Item 0 (highest value 59, agent 2)
  - Item 7 (highest value 73, agent 0)
  - Item 5 (highest value 58, agent 1)
  - Item 3 (highest value 37, agent 1)
  - Item 4 (highest value 36, agent 0)
  - Item 2 (highest value 15, agent 2)

- **Step 2**: Ensure each agent has a fair number of items:
  - Agent 0: Items 7 and 4
  - Agent 1: Items 1, 6, 5, 3 (4 items)
  - Agent 2: Items 8, 0, 2 (3 items)

- **Step 3**: Adjust allocations if necessary to balance item count:
  - Reallocate item 6 from agent 1 to agent 0, as agent 0 is slightly underrepresented in item count.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has received items based on the highest valuations while maintaining a fair distribution.
