Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  60   2  91  99  42  79  78  67
1   5  89  76  74  95  11  44  66  46
2  26  81  91  65  67   9  13  92  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 60  2 91 99 42 79 78 67]
 [ 5 89 76 74 95 11 44 66 46]
 [26 81 91 65 67  9 13 92 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their individual valuations of the items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (99), 3 (91), 0 (86)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (95), 1 (89), 2 (76)
   
3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (91), 7 (92), 1 (81)

However, since each item can only be allocated once, we need to find a balanced allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 86)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 89)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 91)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 91)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 95)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 42)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 44)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value 92)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (value 33)

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on the given valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 7, 8]
}
```
