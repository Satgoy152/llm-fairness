Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  48  73  54  96  46  79  49  30
1  45  87  42  82  29  34  16  86  82
2  10  79  27  32  80  83  26  48  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total number of items each agent should ideally receive. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should receive 3 items.

2. Assign the items to the agents based on the highest value they place on each item until each agent receives 3 items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest values: Item 4 (96), Item 2 (73), Item 6 (79)
  - Allocate: [4, 2, 6]

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest values: Item 1 (87), Item 7 (86), Item 3 (82)
  - Allocate: [1, 7, 3]

- **Agent 2**:
  - Remaining items with highest values: Item 5 (83), Item 8 (91), Item 0 (10)
  - Allocate: [5, 8, 0]

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items and makes use of the highest value preferences for each agent.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 7, 3],
    "2": [5, 8, 0]
}
```
