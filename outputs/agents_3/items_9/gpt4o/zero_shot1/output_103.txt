Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  42  85  35  58   9  74   8  47
1  86  30  46  48  76  54  14  74  44
2   0  17  51  98  17  94   9  95   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable total value of items while keeping the allocations balanced. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it:

1.  Identify the highest value each agent assigns to each item.
2.  Allocate items to the agents based on the highest valuations, ensuring an even distribution when possible.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 86 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 42 by Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 98 by Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 76 by Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 74 by Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
9. Item 8: Highest value is 47 by Agent 0.

Now, let's organize these allocations to ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 6, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 7]

Each agent has received a fair allocation, balancing the number of items and their total value. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
