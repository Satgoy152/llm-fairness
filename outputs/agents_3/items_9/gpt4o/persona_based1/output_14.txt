Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  82   5  24  29  28  65  15   3
1  26   9  61  56  33   2  37  55  30
2  58   4  52  65  18  86  56  25  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. This means each agent should value their allocated set at least as much as they value the set allocated to any other agent. Additionally, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze each agent's preferences:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [63, 82, 5, 24, 29, 28, 65, 15, 3]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [26, 9, 61, 56, 33, 2, 37, 55, 30]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [58, 4, 52, 65, 18, 86, 56, 25, 91]

A heuristic approach to ensure fairness is to allocate the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives according to their own valuation. We will try to distribute the items based on maximizing the minimum value received by each agent.

Let's assign the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 1, 6
   - Total value: 82 (Item 1) + 65 (Item 6) = 147

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 3, 4, 7
   - Total value: 56 (Item 3) + 33 (Item 4) + 55 (Item 7) = 144

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 0, 2, 5, 8
   - Total value: 58 (Item 0) + 52 (Item 2) + 86 (Item 5) + 91 (Item 8) = 287

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a significant portion of their valued items. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation strategy attempts to provide a fair distribution based on each agent's valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.
