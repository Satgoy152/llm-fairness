Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  32  88  37   7  75  57  72  49
1  42  66  42   8  84  82   4  38  62
2  28   1   7  19  60  73  28  56  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** Determine the total value each agent places on all the items combined. This can help us gauge each agent's overall interest and guide us in making balanced allocations.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Begin by assigning items to agents based on maximizing each agent's utility while ensuring the allocations remain fair. This means we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** Ensure that no agent envies another by comparing the total value of the items assigned to each agent. If an agent values another's allocation more than their own, adjustments should be made.

4. **Adjust Allocations:** Make necessary adjustments to achieve a fair distribution where possible. This might involve reassigning items to balance perceived values.

Let's calculate and allocate:

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 22 + 32 + 88 + 37 + 7 + 75 + 57 + 72 + 49 = 439
- Agent 1: 42 + 66 + 42 + 8 + 84 + 82 + 4 + 38 + 62 = 428
- Agent 2: 28 + 1 + 7 + 19 + 60 + 73 + 28 + 56 + 75 = 347

### Initial Allocation:
Start by giving each agent a high-value item they value highly:

- Agent 0: Items 2 (88), 5 (75)
- Agent 1: Items 4 (84), 5 (82)
- Agent 2: Items 5 (73), 8 (75)

### Adjustments:
To balance the distribution and ensure each agent receives three items, we can adjust the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 5, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 7, 6]
- Agent 2: [8, 0, 3]

### Final Allocations:
Upon checking the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 5, 1 with total valuation of 88+75+32 = 195
- Agent 1 receives items 4, 7, 6 with total valuation of 84+38+4 = 126
- Agent 2 receives items 8, 0, 3 with total valuation of 75+28+19 = 122

These allocations attempt to distribute value equitably. Let's present the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 1],
    "1": [4, 7, 6],
    "2": [8, 0, 3]
}
```

Note: While this allocation strives for fairness, achieving true envy-freeness with integer divisions and differing valuations might not always be possible. This allocation aims to minimize envy by balancing high-valued items among agents.
