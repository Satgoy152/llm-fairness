Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  45  45  71   3  97  23  90  35
1  10  30  90  43  11  63   9   2   6
2  67  38  37  98  43  26  21  57  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common approach for fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, since achieving perfect envy-freeness is not always possible, especially with indivisible items, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

To begin, we can use a simple approach to allocate items by maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations are for items 5 (97) and 3 (71).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 2 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 3 (98), 0 (67), and 8 (71).

Considering these, let's allocate items while minimizing envy:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Next, we continue allocating remaining items:

- Agent 0 can get item 0 (53) and item 1 (45).
- Agent 2 can get item 8 (71).
- Agent 1 can get item 4 (11).

Finally, allocate remaining items:

- Assign item 6 and item 7 to Agent 0.

This allocation is not perfect in terms of envy-freeness, but it ensures each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 8]
}
```
