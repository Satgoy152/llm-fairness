Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  27  91  53  60  10  72  36  45
1  60  15  28  10  32  96  35  72  82
2  84  84  48  24  53  76  55  70  40
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items they value as much as possible, such that no agent envies another's allocation. Given the complexity of this problem, especially with integer allocations, we'll apply a heuristic approach to balance the total value each agent receives as equitably as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 59 + 27 + 91 + 53 + 60 + 10 + 72 + 36 + 45 = 453
- Agent 1: 60 + 15 + 28 + 10 + 32 + 96 + 35 + 72 + 82 = 430
- Agent 2: 84 + 84 + 48 + 24 + 53 + 76 + 55 + 70 + 40 = 534

Next, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value according to their own valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0, 7] (values: 91, 59, 36) => Total value = 186
- Agent 1: Items [5, 8, 3] (values: 96, 82, 10) => Total value = 188
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4, 6] (values: 84, 53, 55) => Total value = 192

This allocation gives each agent a bundle that they value approximately equally, which is a step towards envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 7],
    "1": [5, 8, 3],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their own valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
