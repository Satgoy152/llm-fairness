Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  30  95  78  71  92  65  52  26
1  43  11  80  57  14  28  37  53  24
2   4   5  88  40  48  75  39  24  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations while keeping the allocation envy-free if possible. We also need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 (95), 5 (92), and 3 (78).
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 (80), 3 (57), and 7 (53).
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: Agent 2 highly values items 2 (88), 5 (75), and 8 (88).

Given these preferences, we can start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent and then distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation.

**Allocation Steps**:
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 since it's their highest valued item and highly valued by others.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as it's highly valued by them and not the top choice for others.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it's highly valued by them and not the top choice for others.
- Next, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value:

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 5, 8

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences and the total number of items. The division may not be perfectly envy-free due to the nature of the problem, but it aims to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 7],
    "2": [5, 8]
