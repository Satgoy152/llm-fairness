Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  52  29  91  51  65  67   5  91
1  42  55  26  57  77  33  25  88  11
2  27   9   9  60  96  20  62  13  45
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim for an allocation where no agent envies another, or at least minimize envy. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" algorithm, but given the constraints and the simplicity of the problem, a heuristic approach can be efficient.

Let's start by calculating each agent's total valuation for all items and then try to balance the allocations so that each agent has a roughly equal share of the total valuation.

Valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 81 + 52 + 29 + 91 + 51 + 65 + 67 + 5 + 91 = 532
- Agent 1: 42 + 55 + 26 + 57 + 77 + 33 + 25 + 88 + 11 = 414
- Agent 2: 27 + 9 + 9 + 60 + 96 + 20 + 62 + 13 + 45 = 341

The total valuation across all items is 532 + 414 + 341 = 1287. Ideally, each agent would get approximately one-third of this total valuation, which is about 429.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to balance the total value received by each agent.

### Item Allocation Strategy

1. **Assign high-value items to balance the total valuations.**
   - Agent 0: Allocate high-value items to Agent 0 initially because they have higher total valuation. 
   - Agent 1: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly to balance their lower total valuation.
   - Agent 2: Similarly, for Agent 2.

2. **Iteratively assign items to minimize envy.**

### Allocation
- Assign items to the agents by considering their value for each item and the current total value they have received.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 8] (Values: 81, 91, 91, Total: 263)
- Agent 1: [4, 7] (Values: 77, 88, Total: 165)
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 5, 6] (Values: 9, 9, 20, 62, Total: 100)

Now, let's check the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: [0, 3, 8] - Total valuation = 263
2. **Agent 1**: [4, 7] - Total valuation = 165
3. **Agent 2**: [1, 2, 5, 6] - Total valuation = 100

This allocation method gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations. Although it might not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of items, it minimizes envy by balancing high-value items among the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 8],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a share that attempts to balance the total value among them.
