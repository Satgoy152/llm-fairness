Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  95  55  67  94  84  30  34  97
1  75   6  69   2  41  38  48  41  26
2  87  14  41  83  79  32  88  62  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, aiming to minimize envy among agents by maximizing their individual valuations for the items they receive. We'll use a simple approach to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction for their assigned items.

Let's start by calculating each agent's total valuation for the items and then try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced.

Here are the steps we'll follow:
1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents in a way that balances total valuation as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:
   - Highest to lowest: Item 8 (97), Item 1 (95), Item 4 (94), Item 5 (84), Item 3 (67), Item 2 (55), Item 0 (47), Item 7 (34), Item 6 (30)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Highest to lowest: Item 0 (75), Item 2 (69), Item 6 (48), Item 4 (41), Item 7 (41), Item 5 (38), Item 8 (26), Item 1 (6), Item 3 (2)

3. **Agent 2's Valuations**:
   - Highest to lowest: Item 6 (88), Item 0 (87), Item 3 (83), Item 4 (79), Item 7 (62), Item 2 (41), Item 5 (32), Item 8 (34), Item 1 (14)

Based on these preferences, let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0** should receive items: 8, 1, 5
   - Total valuation: 97 + 95 + 84 = 276

- **Agent 1** should receive items: 0, 2, 7
   - Total valuation: 75 + 69 + 41 = 185

- **Agent 2** should receive items: 6, 3, 4
   - Total valuation: 88 + 83 + 79 = 250

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, while each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [6, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the total number of items allocated is 9, satisfying the requirements.
