Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77   1  75  49  51  81  78  25   4
1  81   6  52  22  78  23  72  48  28
2  89  56  59   4  81  91  95  74   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 56 59  4 81 91 95 74  6]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items, we will aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Agent 0:  77   1  75  49  51  81  78  25   4
Agent 1:  81   6  52  22  78  23  72  48  28
Agent 2:  89  56  59   4  81  91  95  74   6
```

We'll use a strategy to allocate items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives some items and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Start by identifying the items each agent values the most and try to allocate those items to them if possible.

2. **Balance Total Value Across Agents**: Aim to distribute the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: Ensure all items are allocated by distributing any remaining items such that no agent feels another agent has received a disproportionately better allocation.

After evaluating the valuations, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 3, 7]
- **Agent 1** receives items [1, 4, 8]
- **Agent 2** receives items [2, 5, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value across agents and ensures all items are distributed.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
