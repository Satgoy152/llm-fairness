Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  29  39  77   7  19  39  21  48
1  44  50  46  37  68  21   5  32  31
2  11  39   3  62  81  62  22  14  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 39  3 62 81 62 22 14 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an approach that minimizes envy and attempts to give each agent a fair share according to their valuations. One common method to achieve this is to use the "maximum marginal value" approach, where at each step, we assign the current unallocated item to the agent who values it the most relative to their current total value.

Let's evaluate the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [91, 29, 39, 77, 7, 19, 39, 21, 48]
Agent 1: [44, 50, 46, 37, 68, 21, 5, 32, 31]
Agent 2: [11, 39, 3, 62, 81, 62, 22, 14, 94]
```

We will allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it most (91)
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it most (50)
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it most (46)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it most (77)
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it most (81)
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it most (62)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it most (39)
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it most (32)
9. Item 8: Agent 2 values it most (94)

Now, let's distribute these allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5, 8

This distribution attempts to give each agent items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 8]
}
```
