Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  87  44  35  76  83  64  14  63
1  90  72   1  53  80  87  96  93  98
2  96  89  56  41  56  86   5  57  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent perceives they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Here's a possible allocation using a simple approach that tries to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum up the valuations for each agent to get a sense of their overall valuation potential.
   - Agent 0: \(40 + 87 + 44 + 35 + 76 + 83 + 64 + 14 + 63 = 506\)
   - Agent 1: \(90 + 72 + 1 + 53 + 80 + 87 + 96 + 93 + 98 = 670\)
   - Agent 2: \(96 + 89 + 56 + 41 + 56 + 86 + 5 + 57 + 90 = 576\)

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values**: Start by allocating items based on who values them the most.
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most.

3. **Adjust for Fairness and Envy-freeness**: Since agent 1 gets too many items in the initial allocation, we need to reallocate items to achieve balance.
   - Reallocate item 7 to agent 0, who values it more than agent 2.

4. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
   - Agent 2: Items [0, 1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the distribution considers each agent's valuations for the items. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
