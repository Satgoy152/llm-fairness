Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72   4   8  70  39  15  50  22  34
1  21  36  34  84   0  51  38  13  55
2  30  12  68  32  38   3  73   5  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the constraints and the need to allocate all 9 items, we can use a computational approach to determine a near-optimal fair division.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values items 0 and 3 highly (72 and 70, respectively). Let's assign these items to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it's already allocated, we look at the next highest, which are items 5 and 3. Let's assign items 1 and 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 6 and 8. We'll assign items 2, 6, and 8 to Agent 2.

After these assignments, we have items 4 and 5 remaining. We need to allocate these items in a way that balances the overall valuation for each agent:

- **Item 4**: Agent 0 has a valuation of 39, Agent 1 has a valuation of 0, and Agent 2 has a valuation of 38. We'll assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 has a valuation of 15, Agent 1 has a valuation of 51, and Agent 2 has a valuation of 3. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6, 8

This allocation aims for a balanced distribution of total valuations among agents while ensuring that all items are assigned.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 6, 8]
}
```
