Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  70  62  93  78  27  20   2  13
1  92  84  56  79  65  79  75  10  92
2  93  47  82  50  82   0  19  42   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness in mind, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

One approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" method where we try to minimize envy by ensuring each agent's value of their own allocation is as high as possible, compared to the value they would assign to others' allocations.

Let's allocate the items while keeping these considerations in mind:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (93), followed by item 1 (70) and item 2 (62).
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (92), followed by item 8 (92) and item 1 (84).
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (93), followed by item 2 (82) and item 4 (82).

Given this, we can start with the following allocations:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (as it's their highest valuation).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (as it's their highest valuation).
3. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 (it's one of their highest).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Item 1: Allocating to Agent 1 (84) as it's their second-highest remaining preference.
- Item 2: Allocating to Agent 0 (62) as it's their third-highest preference.
- Item 4: Allocating to Agent 2 (82) as it's their second-highest preference.
- Item 5: Allocating to Agent 1 (79) since Agent 1 has a moderate preference for it.
- Item 6: Allocating to Agent 1 (75) as they have the highest value for it.
- Item 7: Allocating to Agent 2 (42) as it's their next highest preference.

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations across agents:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 8, 1, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 0, 4, and 7.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [8, 1, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 7]
}
```
