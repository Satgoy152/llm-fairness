Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72   7  14  99  20   9  25   5  17
1  28  62  40  15   6  50  26   0  78
2  53   7  77  84  37  29  61  75  87
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Total Value for Each Agent**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. This helps understand how much value each agent perceives in the pool.

    - Agent 0: 72 + 7 + 14 + 99 + 20 + 9 + 25 + 5 + 17 = 268
    - Agent 1: 28 + 62 + 40 + 15 + 6 + 50 + 26 + 0 + 78 = 305
    - Agent 2: 53 + 7 + 77 + 84 + 37 + 29 + 61 + 75 + 87 = 510

2. **Determine Fair Shares**: Each agent should get approximately one-third of the total value they perceive, as there are 9 items and 3 agents.

3. **Allocate Items**: Start allocating items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that the total number of items each agent receives is close to one-third of the total items (3 items each, as 9 items/3 agents).

    - Agent 0:
        - Item 3 (Value: 99)
        - Item 0 (Value: 72)
        - Item 6 (Value: 25)

    - Agent 1:
        - Item 8 (Value: 78)
        - Item 1 (Value: 62)
        - Item 5 (Value: 50)

    - Agent 2:
        - Item 2 (Value: 77)
        - Item 7 (Value: 75)
        - Item 4 (Value: 37)

4. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Verify that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 6],
    "1": [8, 1, 5],
    "2": [2, 7, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives 3 items, and the allocations consider their preferences as much as possible to maintain fairness and envy-freeness.
