Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  57  73  13  15  27  69   1  95
1  95  27  79  14   3  29  97  99  35
2  84  31  78  81  14  64  43  91  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should value their own bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle, given their respective valuations.

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to assign items in such a way that maximizes the minimum value each agent has for their allocated items. This can be complex and may not always be perfectly achievable, but we can try to create a balanced allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's start by examining the total valuation each agent has for all items and the relative valuations for specific items. We'll try to distribute items to balance the perceived value among agents:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 440
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 478
   - Agent 2's total valuation: 549

2. Assign items in a way to balance these valuations as evenly as possible, considering individual item values.

After examining the item valuations and aiming to balance the value, one potential allocation could be:

- Assign items to Agent 0: [0, 1, 5] 
  - Total valuation: 91 + 57 + 27 = 175

- Assign items to Agent 1: [6, 7, 8]
  - Total valuation: 97 + 99 + 35 = 231

- Assign items to Agent 2: [2, 3, 4]
  - Total valuation: 78 + 81 + 14 = 173

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent perceives, and no agent should feel envious of another given the constraints of the problem. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [6, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
