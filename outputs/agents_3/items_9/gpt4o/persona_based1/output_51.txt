Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  55  91  66  32  35  20  78  89
1  57   5  79  67   1  87  38  17  76
2  49  26  87  35  53  32   1  49  96
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while trying to maintain envy-freeness, we should attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation based on their individual valuations. Given the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items must be allocated, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which tends to balance fairness and efficiency.

Let's analyze the valuations:
- Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 91.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most at 87.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the most at 96.

A potential fair allocation could involve giving each agent their highest valued item and then balancing the remaining items based on their valuations to minimize envy. Here's one such allocation:

1. Allocate each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0 gets item 2
   - Agent 1 gets item 5
   - Agent 2 gets item 8

2. Allocate the remaining items to balance the overall valuation as evenly as possible:
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 0, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 5, 1, 7
   - Agent 2: Items 8, 4, 6

3. Validate that each agent's allocation is reasonable based on their valuations and adjust if necessary to minimize envy.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 3],
    "1": [5, 1, 7],
    "2": [8, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a set of items that, based on their valuations, should result in a relatively balanced and fair distribution.
