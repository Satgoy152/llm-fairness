Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73   1  92   3  79  93  97  90  78
1  46  39  55  17  22  90  92   5  89
2  98  33  16  26  78  35   0  32  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin method based on each agent's valuations of the items. 

Here's a step-by-step outline of how you might approach this:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:** This helps to understand each agent's overall preference strength and can be used to determine the order of selection in the round-robin process if needed. However, since we're looking for an envy-free allocation, we'll primarily focus on individual item valuations.

2. **Iterative Allocation:** In each round, allow each agent to pick the item they value the most among the remaining items. This is similar to a draft system.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** Continue the allocation rounds until all items are distributed among the agents.

4. **Check for Envy-freeness:** After allocation, verify if the distribution is envy-free, meaning no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's go through this process:

1. **Initial Setup:** 
   - Agent 0 values: [73, 1, 92, 3, 79, 93, 97, 90, 78]
   - Agent 1 values: [46, 39, 55, 17, 22, 90, 92, 5, 89]
   - Agent 2 values: [98, 33, 16, 26, 78, 35, 0, 32, 38]

2. **Allocation Process:**

   - **Round 1:**
     - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 97).
     - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 90).
     - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 98).

   - **Round 2:**
     - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 92).
     - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value 89).
     - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 78).

   - **Round 3:**
     - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 90).
     - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 39).
     - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 26).

3. **Final Allocation:**

   After the above allocation process, each agent has picked items in a manner that maximizes their individual valuation given the remaining items. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 7],
    "1": [5, 8, 1],
    "2": [0, 4, 3]
}
```

This allocation should be free from envy as each agent was allowed to pick the items they valued the most from the remaining pool at each stage.
