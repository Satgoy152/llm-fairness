Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  29  73  42  40  55  27  42   0
1  61  65  16  30  50  88  50  90  40
2  56  64  20  85  79  83  72  52  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their individual valuations, while also ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Given the 3 agents and 9 items, let's proceed to allocate the items.

First, let's analyze each agent's highest-valued items:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuations for items: 2 (73), 0 (36), and 3 (42).
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuations for items: 5 (88), 7 (90), and 1 (65).
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuations for items: 3 (85), 5 (83), and 4 (79).

By observing the highest valuations, we can start allocating items to minimize envy:

1. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0** because it has the highest value for them.
2. **Allocate item 7 to Agent 1** because it has the highest value for them.
3. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 2** because it has the highest value for them.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0** because it's their second highest preference and not strongly contested.
5. **Allocate item 5 to Agent 1** because it's their second highest preference, and they get significant surplus value.
6. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 2** because it's their next highest preference.

Continuing with the remaining items:

7. **Allocate item 6 to Agent 2** because it's a better fit for them in terms of valuations compared to the others.
8. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1** as they value it highly after their first choices.
9. **Allocate item 8 to Agent 0** as it provides additional value to them without causing significant envy.

The allocations are balanced, each agent receives 3 items, and no further adjustments are necessary to achieve envy-freeness. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 8],
    "1": [7, 5, 1],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
