Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  90   7  28  97  81  63  89  35
1  52  32   9  44  77  48  18  28  65
2  54  92  19  52  79   4   3  53   7
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider both their valuations and the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuations for items 0, 1, 4, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a reasonable valuation for item 8 and also values item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1, but since it conflicts with agent 0, we need to balance it carefully.

A fair allocation can be achieved by ensuring each agent gets items that they value relative to their own valuations, minimizing envy.

Let's allocate the items as follows:
- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 4 (valuations: 71, 90, 97)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5, 8 (valuations: 44, 48, 65)
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 6, 7 (valuations: 19, 3, 53)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and the distribution seems balanced based on individual valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 5, 8],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
