Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  97  16  20  19  83  23  35  94
1  43  45  44  66  47  54  44  57  22
2  83  74  89  32  40   9  95  65  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One approach is to attempt to balance each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5, 8]
   - Total valuation: 97 (item 1) + 83 (item 5) + 94 (item 8) = 274

2. **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4, 6]
   - Total valuation: 66 (item 3) + 47 (item 4) + 44 (item 6) = 157

3. **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 7]
   - Total valuation: 83 (item 0) + 89 (item 2) + 65 (item 7) = 237

The allocation attempts to balance the total valuation across the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 3 agents.
