Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  64  32   0  47  58  35  55  57
1  28  47  35  13  53  21  21  46  39
2  25  98  56  10  39  90  30   5   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure or another fair division method to distribute the items.

Here, we'll aim for a fair distribution by ensuring that each agent gets items close to their highest valuations, while also ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal total valuation if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 and item 8 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 4 and item 1 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 1 and item 5 highly.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Start with the highest-valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (64)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (53)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (90)

2. Continue allocating the next highest-valued items, ensuring a balance:
   - Agent 0: Item 8 (57)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (21)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (56)

3. Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuations:
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (55)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (28)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (10)

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly while balancing total valuations as much as possible.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 0],
    "2": [5, 2, 3]
}
```
