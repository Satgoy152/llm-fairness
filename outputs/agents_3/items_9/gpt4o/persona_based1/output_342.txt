Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  86   7   8  27  50  63  71  54
1  88  55  35  46  63  19  35  64  88
2  65  52  79  79  82  47  11  24  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In fair division problems, particularly when dealing with envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be challenging, especially with integer allocations, but we'll attempt to allocate the items in such a way that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

To begin, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 396
- Agent 1: 493
- Agent 2: 488

Next, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels that they receive a fair share, considering their valuations. Since we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items. Given the constraint of integer allocation, we'll proceed with this target.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 1 (Value: 86)
   - Item 6 (Value: 63)
   - Item 7 (Value: 71)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 (Value: 88)
   - Item 4 (Value: 63)
   - Item 8 (Value: 88)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2 (Value: 79)
   - Item 3 (Value: 79)
   - Item 5 (Value: 47)

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations. Let's verify that each agent values their allocation reasonably compared to the alternatives available:

- **Agent 0:** Total value = 86 + 63 + 71 = 220
- **Agent 1:** Total value = 88 + 63 + 88 = 239
- **Agent 2:** Total value = 79 + 79 + 47 = 205

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items according to their valuations, with all 9 items allocated.
