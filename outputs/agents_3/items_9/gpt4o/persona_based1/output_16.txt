Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  36  74  86  32  75  10  46  38
1  44  54  88   3  55  96  25  27  42
2   9  16  83  10  52  11  22  36  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy, which means each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will try to ensure that each agent gets items that provide them with high value. Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 2. Letâ€™s assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 and 2, but item 2 is already allocated. Let's assign items 5 and 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly, but since it's already allocated, we'll focus on what remains valuable to them. Assign items 6, 7, and 8 to Agent 2.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: 0, 3, 2
- Agent 1: 5, 1
- Agent 2: 6, 7, 8

We still have item 4 unallocated. Agent 1 values it more than the others, so it is best to assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 2],
    "1": [5, 1, 4],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
