Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  94  60  75  76  11  67  28  26
1   3  97  34  50  36  95  44  52  65
2  70   9  22  39  98  39  51  83  31
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 1 and relatively high valuations for 5 and 8.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, followed by item 7.

A strategy that can be employed involves:
1. Giving each agent their most valued items first.
2. Distributing remaining items while trying to maintain balance in total valuations for each agent.

Based on this strategy, here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High value items: 0 (83), 1 (94)
   - Other items: 3 (75)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: 1 (97) - already taken by Agent 0
   - High value items: 5 (95), 8 (65)
   - Other items: 4 (36)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: 4 (98) - already taken by Agent 1
   - High value items: 7 (83)
   - Other items: 6 (51), 2 (22)

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [5, 8, 4],
    "2": [7, 6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least some of their highly-valued items while trying to balance the total value each agent receives. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible due to the constraint of dividing items into integer numbers among the agents.
