Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  11  54  54  34  52  12  55   6
1  80  37  23  95  15  65  50   6  79
2  56  62  80  87  74  61  19  47  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 24, 11, 54, 54, 34, 52, 12, 55, 6
   - Allocate items: 2, 3, 5
   - Total value: 54 + 54 + 52 = 160

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 80, 37, 23, 95, 15, 65, 50, 6, 79
   - Allocate items: 0, 4, 6
   - Total value: 80 + 15 + 50 = 145

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 56, 62, 80, 87, 74, 61, 19, 47, 76
   - Allocate items: 1, 7, 8
   - Total value: 62 + 47 + 76 = 185

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items and tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives. The goal is to make the allocation as envy-free as possible given the integer constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 7, 8]
}
```
