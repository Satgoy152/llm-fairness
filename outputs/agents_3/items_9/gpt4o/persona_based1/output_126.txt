Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47   2  28  51  34  32  42  57  82
1  87   4  64  52  39  16  42   0  15
2  79  44  56  20  13  52  80  54  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. This is a complex problem, but a heuristic approach can be used to get a reasonable allocation.

Let's consider an allocation strategy:

1. **Highest Valuation First**: Start by allocating each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. **Iterate Over Remaining Items**: For the remaining items, allocate each item to the agent who values it the most among those who haven't yet received a highly-valued item.

Let's evaluate these steps for the given data:

### Initial Allocation (Highest Valuation First)
- Agent 0: Item 8 (value = 82)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value = 87)
- Agent 2: Item 8 is already allocated, so choose the next highest, which is Item 6 (value = 80)

### Allocate Remaining Items
Now allocate the remaining items to maximize valuations without creating envy:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

**Agent 0**:
- Highest remaining value: Item 3 (value = 51)
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0

**Agent 1**:
- Highest remaining value: Item 2 (value = 64)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1

**Agent 2**:
- Highest remaining value: Item 8 is already allocated, next is Item 5 (value = 52)
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2

### Continue Allocation
- Remaining items: 1, 4, 7

**Agent 0**:
- Next highest value: Item 7 (value = 57)
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0

**Agent 1**:
- Next highest value: Item 4 (value = 39)
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1

**Agent 2**:
- Remaining item 1
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2

### Final Allocation
Now, we have allocated all items:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [6, 5, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a subset of items, aiming to maximize their individual valuations while distributing all items.
