Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  82  87  40  34  60   9  78  72
1  61  69  16   3  97  41  74  47   6
2   7   8   7  62  86  45  84   0  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their subjective valuations. Given the valuations provided in the table, we can approach this problem with the goal of minimizing envy among agents and ensuring a distribution that feels equitable.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use an approach where we try to balance the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items. This might not always be perfectly possible, but we strive to get as close as possible. 

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** values items: 
   - Highest valued: Items 2 (87), 1 (82), 7 (78)

2. **Agent 1** values items:
   - Highest valued: Items 4 (97), 0 (61), 1 (69)

3. **Agent 2** values items:
   - Highest valued: Items 6 (84), 4 (86), 3 (62)

Given these preferences, we can try to start by allocating some of the highest-value items to each agent, and then fill in the remaining items to balance the perceived value.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 7]
  - Total value: 48 (item 0) + 87 (item 2) + 78 (item 7) = 213

- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4]
  - Total value: 69 (item 1) + 97 (item 4) = 166

- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 5, 6, 8]
  - Total value: 62 (item 3) + 45 (item 5) + 84 (item 6) + 34 (item 8) = 225

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their highest valued items, while ensuring all items are allocated. This distribution minimizes envy by attempting to equalize the perceived value each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
