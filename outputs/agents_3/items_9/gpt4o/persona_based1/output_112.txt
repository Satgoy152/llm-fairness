Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  51  90  29  39  64  66  50  31
1  60  68  39  69  47  99  33  14  31
2  87  62  36  41  94  22  86  31  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the three agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, attempting to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. We'll also try to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent and proceed with an allocation that aims to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

**Agent Valuations:**

- **Agent 0:** 7, 51, 90, 29, 39, 64, 66, 50, 31
- **Agent 1:** 60, 68, 39, 69, 47, 99, 33, 14, 31
- **Agent 2:** 87, 62, 36, 41, 94, 22, 86, 31, 69

**Total Valuations:**

- **Agent 0 Total Value:** 427
- **Agent 1 Total Value:** 460
- **Agent 2 Total Value:** 528

**Approach:**

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 2 (90), 6 (66), and 5 (64) highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 5 (99), 3 (69), and 1 (68) highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 0 (87), 4 (94), and 6 (86) highly.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   Allocate items that are most valued by each agent to them while ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   Ensure each agent gets an approximately equal number of items (3 each) and adjust based on remaining values to minimize envy.

**Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 6, 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 5, 1, 7
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 4, 8

**Explanation:**

- Agent 0 receives items 2 (90), 6 (66), and 3 (29) where they have relatively higher valuations.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 (99), 1 (68), and 7 (14), balancing their highest valuations.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 (87), 4 (94), and 8 (69), again aligning with their higher values.

This allocation aims to provide a balance across the agents based on their valuations while ensuring envy-freeness to a reasonable extent and distributing all items.

    "0": [2, 6, 3],
    "1": [5, 1, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 8]
