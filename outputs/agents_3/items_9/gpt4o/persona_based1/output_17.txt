Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  87  42  63  84  36  37   4  94
1  91  48  38  56  62  31   2   4  49
2  98  50  29  47  18  67   0  35  27
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is considered envy-free if, after the allocation, no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 seems to value item 8 the highest (94), then 0 (88), and 1 (87). Allocating these higher-valued items can be a good starting point for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 (91) and item 4 (62) the highest. Assigning these items to agent 1 can help with their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we look to the next highest values: item 5 (67) and item 1 (50). Item 5 and item 1 can be allocated to agent 2.

Balancing these considerations, we can construct the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [8, 0, 2] 
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 3, 7]
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 1, 6]

This distribution attempts to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, reducing envy across the allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0, 2],
    "1": [4, 3, 7],
    "2": [5, 1, 6]
}
```
