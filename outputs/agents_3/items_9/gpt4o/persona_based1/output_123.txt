Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  41  85   7  32  97  50  92  62
1  51  94  30  84  72   4  15  77   8
2  61   7  69  52   4  57  68  86  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to make the distribution as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness is challenging, so we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy given the constraints.

Let's first review the total valuations each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0: 68, 41, 85, 7, 32, 97, 50, 92, 62
- Agent 1: 51, 94, 30, 84, 72, 4, 15, 77, 8
- Agent 2: 61, 7, 69, 52, 4, 57, 68, 86, 60

We can calculate the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 534
- Agent 1: 435
- Agent 2: 464

With these total valuations in mind, let's try to allocate the items. We'll aim to allocate items so that each agent receives a bundle that they highly value and try to keep the total value of each agent's allocation as balanced as possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest total valuation. We will prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 to reduce envy. Let's allocate items 2, 5, 7 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Let's allocate items 1, 3, 4 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 access to some of their higher-valued items.

3. **Agent 2**: The remaining items 0, 6, 8 can be allocated to Agent 2. This ensures that Agent 2 also gets a fair share of the items.

### Allocation

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 5, 7, which are valued at 85, 97, and 92 respectively, totaling 274.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 4, which are valued at 94, 84, and 72 respectively, totaling 250.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 6, 8, which are valued at 61, 68, and 60 respectively, totaling 189.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes envy as much as possible.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 6, 8]
}
```
