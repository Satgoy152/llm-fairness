Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  94  75  65  21  28  71  23  54
1  43  66  72  17  79  53  63  79  68
2  69  60  52  46  68  61  71  40   2
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints that each agent must get an integer number of items and that all items must be allocated. 

An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle. This can be difficult to achieve perfectly, but we can attempt to minimize envy by considering the valuations of the items by each agent and trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value of Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Total value = 91 + 94 + 75 + 65 + 21 + 28 + 71 + 23 + 54 = 522
   - Agent 1: Total value = 43 + 66 + 72 + 17 + 79 + 53 + 63 + 79 + 68 = 540
   - Agent 2: Total value = 69 + 60 + 52 + 46 + 68 + 61 + 71 + 40 + 2 = 469

2. **Fair Share:**
   - There are 9 items, and ideally, each agent should receive approximately 1/3 of the total value of all items, which is (522 + 540 + 469) / 3 = 510.33 per agent.

3. **Allocate Items to Balance the Values:**
   - Start by allocating the highest value items to the agents that value them the most while keeping in mind the fair share.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, 2. Allocate these first.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 4, 7, 8. Allocate these next.
   - Agent 2 highly values items 5, 6. Allocate these items.

Considering these allocations, we can try to balance the remaining items to achieve fairness.

### Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 7, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value relatively more while keeping the total values as balanced as possible. Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2; Agent 1 receives items 4, 7, 8; Agent 2 receives items 3, 5, 6. This distribution of items reflects an attempt at minimizing envy given the constraints.
