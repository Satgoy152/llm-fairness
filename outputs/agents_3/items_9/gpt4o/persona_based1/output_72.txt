Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  95  78  66  90  58  48  61  85
1  87  57  15  54  47  76  61  91   1
2  95  35  57  31  71  31   5   1  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other fair division algorithms like "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) or "Envy-Free up to one good" (EF1).

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has over all items.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent the items they value the most, considering the highest valuation first and ensuring each item is given to the agent who values it most.

3. **Check for Envy**: After the initial allocation, check if there is any envy among the agents. If any agent values another agent's allocated items more than their own, adjustments may be necessary.

4. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust the allocations by swapping items or reassigning them to reduce envy. The goal is to achieve an allocation where each agent believes they have received at least as much value as any other agent.

5. **Final Adjustment for Exactness**: Ensure that all 9 items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Using this method to process the given valuations:

### Allocation Process:
- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the highest (95) and item 4 (90).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 (87) and item 7 (91) highly.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 (95) and item 4 (71) highly.

After evaluating and considering the potential envy scenarios, we can allocate the items as follows:

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 6, 8]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 5, and 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 6, and 8.

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations and minimize potential envy among the agents.
