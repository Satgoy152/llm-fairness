Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  28  70  47  60  35  68  40  57
1  30  21  47  40  28  38  73  26  91
2  88  76   7  25  32   8  52  60  17
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 28 70 47 60 35 68 40 57]
 [30 21 47 40 28 38 73 26 91]
 [88 76  7 25 32  8 52 60 17]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, with the goal of achieving an envy-free allocation, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution as a heuristic. This aims to maximize the product of the agents' utilities, which often leads to allocations that are close to envy-free. Here's one possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: 0 (91), 2 (70), 6 (68).
   - Assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 1: 8 (91), 6 (73), 2 (47).
   - Since item 6 is already assigned, we look for next best options: 3 (40).
   - Assign items 8, 2, and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: 0 (88), 1 (76), 7 (60).
   - Since item 0 is already assigned, assign items 1, 5, and 7 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 8, 3, 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 5, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction given the constraints.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [8, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the integer item constraint and ensures each agent receives items that they value highly, aiming to reduce envy among agents.
