Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  76  89  83  76  65  92  84  23
1  17  93  96   7  83  98  51  64  44
2  62  71  50  28  14  77  42  69  69
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and attempt to equalize their perceived value of their allocated items. This is a complex problem, especially with integer items, but we can attempt a balanced allocation.

Let's start by examining the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 4 + 76 + 89 + 83 + 76 + 65 + 92 + 84 + 23 = 592
- Agent 1: 17 + 93 + 96 + 7 + 83 + 98 + 51 + 64 + 44 = 553
- Agent 2: 62 + 71 + 50 + 28 + 14 + 77 + 42 + 69 + 69 = 482

Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as close as possible in value based on their own valuations. 

One approach to achieve a fair division is to iteratively allocate the highest valued item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that allocations remain balanced:

1. Item 5 (Agent 1 values it at 98) -> Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 2 (Agent 1 values it at 96) -> Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 6 (Agent 0 values it at 92) -> Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 1 (Agent 1 values it at 93) -> Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 0 (Agent 2 values it at 62) -> Allocate to Agent 2.
6. Item 3 (Agent 0 values it at 83) -> Allocate to Agent 0.
7. Item 4 (Agent 1 values it at 83) -> Allocate to Agent 1.
8. Item 7 (Agent 0 values it at 84) -> Allocate to Agent 0.
9. Item 8 (Agent 2 values it at 69) -> Allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 3, 7]
  - Total Value: 92 + 83 + 84 = 259
- Agent 1: Items [5, 2, 1, 4]
  - Total Value: 98 + 96 + 93 + 83 = 370
- Agent 2: Items [0, 8]
  - Total Value: 62 + 69 = 131

While this allocation does not perfectly equalize the total perceived value due to integer constraints, it attempts to respect the highest valuations for the most valuable items for each agent. Thus, the perceived envy should be minimized.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 7],
    "1": [5, 2, 1, 4],
    "2": [0, 8]
}
```
