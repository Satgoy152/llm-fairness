Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  88  74  79  80  30  61  61  95
1  68  81  38  71  27  10  82  14  85
2  14  38  76   3  54  29   6  34  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 88 74 79 80 30 61 61 95]
 [68 81 38 71 27 10 82 14 85]
 [14 38 76  3 54 29  6 34 91]]
Output:
To allocate items to the agents fairly, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-freeness as possible. This means each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations of the items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [98, 88, 74, 79, 80, 30, 61, 61, 95]
Agent 1: [68, 81, 38, 71, 27, 10, 82, 14, 85]
Agent 2: [14, 38, 76, 3, 54, 29, 6, 34, 91]
```

We'll use the following approach to allocate the items:

1. **Maximize Total Value for Each Agent**: Try to allocate items to each agent that maximize their total value.
2. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure each agent gets a roughly equal number of items, since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: 98 (item 0), 88 (item 1), 95 (item 8)
   - Allocate items with highest value: 0, 1, 8

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: 82 (item 6), 85 (item 8), 81 (item 1)
   - Allocate items with highest value not taken by Agent 0: 6, 3, 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: 91 (item 8), 76 (item 2), 54 (item 4)
   - Allocate items with highest value not taken by others: 2, 5, 7

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 4, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 5, 7

This allocation attempts to balance the overall value while ensuring each agent receives items they value highly. 

Here is the resulting JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
