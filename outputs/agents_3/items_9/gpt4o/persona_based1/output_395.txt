Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  26  97  50  26  49  78   3  80
1  62  93  53   8  25  78   8  10  13
2  69  19  69   8  47  67  69  63  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 26 97 50 26 49 78  3 80]
 [62 93 53  8 25 78  8 10 13]
 [69 19 69  8 47 67 69 63 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent perceives their own allocation as at least as valuable as the allocation of any other agent. Given the valuations, we can attempt to approximate envy-freeness through a fair division method like the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum marginal value method, but here we'll proceed through a heuristic approach to balance allocations based on total value perceived by each agent.

### Valuation Table:
- Agent 0: [93, 26, 97, 50, 26, 49, 78, 3, 80]
- Agent 1: [62, 93, 53, 8, 25, 78, 8, 10, 13]
- Agent 2: [69, 19, 69, 8, 47, 67, 69, 63, 99]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Value Items:** 
   - Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 0 (97).
   - Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1 (93).
   - Item 8 is highly valued by Agent 2 (99).

2. **Initial Allocation of Key Items:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 8 to Agent 2.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Consider remaining high-value items for each agent and distribute them to balance total value.
   - Allocate the remaining items to achieve a balanced distribution of values perceived by each agent.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 0, 2, 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items 1, 4, 6, 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items 3, 8 to Agent 2.

### Valuation Check:
- Total value for Agent 0: 93 + 97 + 49 = 239
- Total value for Agent 1: 93 + 25 + 8 + 10 = 136
- Total value for Agent 2: 8 + 99 = 107

This allocation aims to balance the total perceived value across agents, considering their highest valued items, and tries to minimize any potential envy.

### Allocation JSON:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7],
    "2": [3, 8]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all 9 items are allocated among the 3 agents while attempting to maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
