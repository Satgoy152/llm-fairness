Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  21  20  14  62  32  80  21  62
1  37  15  64  51  30  43  38  56   6
2   2  84  75  85  18  48  30  77   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that is envy-free and balanced. Each agent has different valuations for the items, and our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. 

Let's first consider a simple heuristic approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations by Agent:**  
   - Agent 0: 22 + 21 + 20 + 14 + 62 + 32 + 80 + 21 + 62 = 334
   - Agent 1: 37 + 15 + 64 + 51 + 30 + 43 + 38 + 56 + 6 = 340
   - Agent 2: 2 + 84 + 75 + 85 + 18 + 48 + 30 + 77 + 8 = 427

2. **Allocate items based on relative valuations:**  
   - Each agent should get items such that they perceive they have received a fair value. The allocation should be envy-free or as close to it as possible.

3. **Consider Allocation Strategy:**  
   - We will allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their valuation and minimizes envy.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes total utility for each agent based on their individual valuations.

After analyzing different possible distributions and considering the highest values for each agent, one possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 8, 5]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 22 (item 0) + 62 (item 8) + 32 (item 5) = 116

- **Agent 1:** Items [2, 3, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 64 (item 2) + 51 (item 3) + 56 (item 7) = 171

- **Agent 2:** Items [1, 4, 6]
  - Total valuation for Agent 2: 84 (item 1) + 18 (item 4) + 30 (item 6) = 132

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they value highly, and it ensures that all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 5],
    "1": [2, 3, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
