Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  20  75  35  66  69   2  64  49
1  85  93   0  29  10  71  17  75  91
2  20  77  11   7  24  85  37   5  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and allocate them in such a way that, ideally, no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. However, since perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, we aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

First, we calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(61 + 20 + 75 + 35 + 66 + 69 + 2 + 64 + 49 = 441\)
- Agent 1: \(85 + 93 + 0 + 29 + 10 + 71 + 17 + 75 + 91 = 471\)
- Agent 2: \(20 + 77 + 11 + 7 + 24 + 85 + 37 + 5 + 47 = 313\)

Given these totals, we see that Agent 1 has the highest valuation, followed by Agent 0, then Agent 2.

Let's attempt to allocate items to balance the total valuations received by each agent as closely as possible:

1. **Agent 1** (highest total valuation):
   - Allocate high-value items for Agent 1: Items 1, 7, and 8 (valuations: 93, 75, 91)
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(93 + 75 + 91 = 259\)

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate high-value items for Agent 0: Items 0, 2, and 5 (valuations: 61, 75, 69)
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(61 + 75 + 69 = 205\)

3. **Agent 2** (lowest total valuation):
   - Allocate remaining items for Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 6 (valuations: 7, 24, 37)
   - Total valuation for Agent 2: \(7 + 24 + 37 = 68\)

Now, let's examine the allocations to ensure each agent receives items and the total number of items allocated is 9:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 7, 8]
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 6]

Each agent has received a fair share of items, and we have met the requirement of allocating exactly 9 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 7, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
