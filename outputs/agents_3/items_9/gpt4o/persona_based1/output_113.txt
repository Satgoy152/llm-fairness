Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  22  37  15  23  85  67  12  77
1  60  37  41  39  74  58  94   2  68
2  25  33  30  46  13  11  30  78  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we'll start by considering each agent's preferences and valuations. The goal is to find a balance where each agent feels they have received a fair share, although achieving complete envy-freeness might not always be possible due to the constraints.

We'll proceed by analyzing the valuations and trying to allocate items to maximize the perceived value for each agent, considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items and exactly 9 items must be allocated in total.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest valued items are 5 (85), 8 (77), and 6 (67).
   - Let's allocate items 5 and 8 to Agent 0, as they provide significant value.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest valued items are 6 (94), 4 (74), and 8 (68).
   - Since item 6 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1, we will give item 6 to Agent 1 to balance the allocations.
   - We'll also allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest valued items are 7 (78), 3 (46), and 1 (33).
   - Item 7 is unique in its high valuation, so it is allocated to Agent 2.
   - We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2 for additional fairness.

4. **Remaining Items**: 
   - Items remaining after the high-value allocations are 0, 1, and 2.
   - Let's balance the allocations by giving item 0 to Agent 2, item 1 to Agent 1, and item 2 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [5, 8, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [6, 4, 1]
- **Agent 2**: [7, 3, 0]

These allocations are fairly distributed considering the valuations and constraints. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8, 2],
    "1": [6, 4, 1],
    "2": [7, 3, 0]
}
```
