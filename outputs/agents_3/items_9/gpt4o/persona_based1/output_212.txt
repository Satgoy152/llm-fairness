Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  94  50  76  17  26  16  14  60
1  28   4   5  10  37  44  49  39   6
2  25  15  66  58   3  23  99  27  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents that also aims for envy-freeness, we will use a method that ensures each agent gets items that are most valuable to them while minimizing the envy between agents. Given the valuations, we need to ensure that every agent feels they received the best possible shares based on their own valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.
2. Allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's utility while ensuring that each agent gets at least a fair share relative to their valuation.

Let's look at the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 368
- Agent 1 total valuation: 222
- Agent 2 total valuation: 364

Next, we prioritize items based on each agent's valuation and try to allocate items such that each agent feels satisfied:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (94), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly (99), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (76) after item 1, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (66), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (49), but since item 6 is already taken, we look at the next highest, which is item 5 (44), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 8 highly (60) after the previous allocations, so assign item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly (48) but it's already allocated, so we assign them item 7, which is valued at 27.
- Agent 1 values item 7 next (39), but it's been allocated, so move to item 4 (37), assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Finally, we have items 0 and 4 unallocated. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 as it provides them additional utility.

After this allocation, we need to ensure that all items are distributed. We add any remaining items that maximize each agent's utility and ensure that each agent has at least some items.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 8],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6, 2, 7, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has received items they highly value, attempting to minimize envy and maximize fairness considering their total valuations.
