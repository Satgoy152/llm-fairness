Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  55  36  70  76  66  42  39  15
1  63  33  55  25  50   3  71  95  61
2  20  43  99  61  37  44  64  22  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's consider each agent's total value for all items and try to balance this distribution by allocating items that maximize each agent's perceived value.

### Step 1: Calculate the total value for all items for each agent.

Agent 0: 27 + 55 + 36 + 70 + 76 + 66 + 42 + 39 + 15 = 426  
Agent 1: 63 + 33 + 55 + 25 + 50 + 3 + 71 + 95 + 61 = 456  
Agent 2: 20 + 43 + 99 + 61 + 37 + 44 + 64 + 22 + 11 = 401  

### Step 2: Allocate the items to the agents.

Based on the values, we'll allocate items by attempting to maximize each agent's total perceived value while keeping allocations as balanced as possible.

#### Allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: We will allocate items that maximize their total value while ensuring fairness.
   - Items: 4 (76), 3 (70), 5 (66)

2. **Agent 1**: We will allocate the items that maximize their total value while ensuring fairness.
   - Items: 7 (95), 6 (71), 8 (61)

3. **Agent 2**: We will allocate the remaining items to agent 2.
   - Items: 2 (99), 1 (43), 0 (20)

With this allocation, each agent gets a perceived fair share of the items based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 5],
    "1": [7, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 1, 0]
}
```

This solution ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
