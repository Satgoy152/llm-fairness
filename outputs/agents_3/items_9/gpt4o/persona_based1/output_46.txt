Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  27   5  87  10  18  22  99  77
1  44  56  62  66  94   1  41  47  91
2  90   3  47  88  25  68  89  78  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, I’ll use an approach that aims to minimize envy among the agents. Envy-freeness occurs when each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Here’s a step-by-step strategy to allocate these items:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items for Each Agent**: Determine which items each agent values the most and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.

2. **Consider Balanced Allocations**: Ensure that each agent gets approximately the same number of items, to the extent possible.

3. **Check Envy-Freeness**: Re-evaluate if any agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own and adjust if necessary, while keeping the distribution balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 0 (72), 3 (87), and 7 (99).
- **Agent 1** highly values items 4 (94), 2 (62), and 8 (91).
- **Agent 2** highly values items 0 (90), 3 (88), and 6 (89).

Given this, let's try to allocate based on these high valuations and adjust for balance.

**Allocation:**
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, given their high valuation.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1, given their high valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, balancing the number of items.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 for balance and high value.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, based on remaining options.

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items and attempts to respect their highest valuations while minimizing envy.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and tries to keep envy at a minimum.
