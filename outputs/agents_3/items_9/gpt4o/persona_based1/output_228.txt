Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  83  43  61  34  98  44  19  47
1  74  47  25  56  75  46   5   3  52
2  18  29  74  18  53  92  29  65  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible. We'll consider each agent's valuations and try to ensure that each agent perceives they are getting an equitable share of items. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in this setting, we will aim for a balanced distribution based on the highest valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. Assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 4 the most, followed by item 8 and item 3. Assign these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: They have high valuations for items 2, 6, and 7. Assign these to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items, and the total number of items allocated is 9. Each agent receives items they value highly.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [4, 8, 3],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences.
