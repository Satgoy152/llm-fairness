Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  76  50  33  68  59  61  38  91
1   3  17  58   2  73  32  43  92  38
2  81  99  85  94  98  46  35  40  57
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. This can be challenging, but a common method is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool. 

Let's follow this approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 8 the highest (91). Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the highest (92). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (98). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

Second round of allocations:

4. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest (76). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1** values item 4 the next highest but it's taken. The next highest available is item 4, which is taken, so they choose item 6 (43). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** values item 3 the next highest (94). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

Final round of allocations:

7. **Agent 0** values item 0 the next highest (51). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1** values item 5 the next highest (32). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
9. **Agent 2** values item 2 the next highest (85). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1, 0],
    "1": [7, 6, 5],
    "2": [4, 3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent picks high-valued items according to their preferences, distributing the items as fairly as possible under the constraints.
