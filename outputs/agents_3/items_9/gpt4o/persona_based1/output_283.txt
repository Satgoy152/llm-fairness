Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  98  98  71  97  62  98  87  66
1  54  25  84  63  77  82  72  35  72
2   8   1  86  72  35  25   8  59  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, or at least a division that minimizes envy as much as possible. Each agent has different valuations for the items, and the goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, considering their personal valuations.

Here's a step-by-step procedure for an allocation that attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values items 1, 2, 4, and 6 highly (all 98).
   - Agent 1 has relatively high values for items 2, 5, and 4.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most, followed by items 8 and 3.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring fairness and minimizing envy.
   - Consider each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate them in a way that minimizes the difference in perceived value among the agents.

3. **Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign items 1, 4, 6: These are among the highest valued items for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign items 5, 2, 7: Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1, and item 5 is the second-highest value for them.

- **Agent 2:**
  - Assign items 0, 3, 8: These items provide a decent total value for Agent 2 and are not the top choices for the other agents.

This allocation distributes the items such that each agent receives items that are among their more valued, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [5, 2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 8]
}
```
