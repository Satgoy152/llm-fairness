Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  89  22  18  65  59  86  43  64
1  37  46  14  82  42  16   2  63  85
2  62  89  14  26  33  26  79  31  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair compared to others. An envy-free allocation means no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations and different valuation profiles can be challenging. 

We'll use a heuristic approach to try and minimize envy, ensuring each agent gets a share that they perceive as fair based on their valuations. We will consider a fair share for each agent as the total value of all items divided by the number of agents, which is the ideal value each agent would like to achieve.

Let's calculate the total value for each agent and the fair share:

1. Total value of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: \(26 + 89 + 22 + 18 + 65 + 59 + 86 + 43 + 64 = 472\)
   - Agent 1: \(37 + 46 + 14 + 82 + 42 + 16 + 2 + 63 + 85 = 387\)
   - Agent 2: \(62 + 89 + 14 + 26 + 33 + 26 + 79 + 31 + 29 = 389\)

2. Fair share for each agent (total value divided by 3):
   - Fair share: \(\frac{472 + 387 + 389}{3} \approx 416\)

With this setup, we aim to allocate items such that each agent's total perceived value is as close as possible to their fair share based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation that aims to minimize envy:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (high value for 0 and 2, but more significant for 0)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (high value for 1)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (high value for 2)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (high value for 2)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (moderate value for 0)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (high value for 1)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1

This allocation tries to balance the perceived fairness across agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 4, 2],
    "1": [8, 3, 5],
    "2": [6, 0]
}
```

This distribution aims to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent's highest-valued items where possible and distributing lower-valued items to achieve a fair share based on each agent's total valuation.
