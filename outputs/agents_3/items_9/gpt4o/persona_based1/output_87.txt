Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  23  64  63  25  74  60   0  58
1  97  47   0  18  18  98  17  32  50
2   6  94  91  68  22  60  76  68  43
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Here, "envy-freeness" means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

### Step 1: Analyze Valuations
- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items: 5 (74), 2 (64), 3 (63), and 6 (60).
- Agent 1's highest valuations are for items: 0 (97), 5 (98), and 1 (47).
- Agent 2's highest valuations are for items: 1 (94), 2 (91), 6 (76), and 3 (68).

### Step 2: Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations
We can start by assigning items with the highest valuations to the respective agents:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value of 98.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the second-highest value of 97.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it has a high value of 91.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it has a high value of 94.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it has a high value of 76.

### Step 3: Allocate Remaining Items
Now, allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 7, 8):

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it has a value of 63, which is significant for Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has a value of 25.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it has a value of 32, which is better than for Agents 0 and 2.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0, as it has a value of 58, higher than Agent 2's valuation.

### Final Allocations
After considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation preferences, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 8],
    "1": [0, 5, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that are highly valued to them, minimizing envy.
