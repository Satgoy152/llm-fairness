Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  13  75  32  32  81  19  29  13
1  83  14  26   2  83  87  86  81  99
2  57  72  13   7  11  11  76  56  25
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 13 75 32 32 81 19 29 13]
 [83 14 26  2 83 87 86 81 99]
 [57 72 13  7 11 11 76 56 25]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate items such that the distribution is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible given the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent to their own bundle, according to their valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  13  75  32  32  81  19  29  13
1  83  14  26   2  83  87  86  81  99
2  57  72  13   7  11  11  76  56  25
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuations for items 8 and 7, so they should receive these.
2. **Agent 0** values items 0 and 5 highly, so they should receive these.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly, so they should receive this.
4. Distribute the remaining items in a way that tries to equalize the total value of items received by each agent, while taking into account their preferences.

### Proposed Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5]
   - Valuation: 81 (item 0) + 81 (item 5) = 162

2. **Agent 1**: Items [7, 8]
   - Valuation: 81 (item 7) + 99 (item 8) = 180

3. **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
   - Valuation: 72 (item 1) + 13 (item 2) + 7 (item 3) + 11 (item 4) + 76 (item 6) = 179

### JSON Format Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents, and tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives, given the constraint of integer allocations.
