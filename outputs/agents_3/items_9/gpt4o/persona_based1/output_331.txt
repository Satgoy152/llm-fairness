Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  25  30  86   6   2  27  15  77
1  32  28  95  73  10  64  58  43  13
2  91  99  33  65  41   7  85  15  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, one approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. However, given the constraint of integer allocations and the relatively small problem size, we can also attempt a heuristic approach to balance their valuations and item assignments.

Here's a step-by-step strategy for allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 37 + 25 + 30 + 86 + 6 + 2 + 27 + 15 + 77 = 305
   - Agent 1: 32 + 28 + 95 + 73 + 10 + 64 + 58 + 43 + 13 = 416
   - Agent 2: 91 + 99 + 33 + 65 + 41 + 7 + 85 + 15 + 50 = 486

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on which agent values them the most, to minimize envy.
  
3. **Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (91 is the highest)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (99 is the highest)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (95 is the highest)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (86 is the highest)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (41 is the highest)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (64 is the highest)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (85 is the highest)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (15 is tied, but Agent 0 has fewer high-value items)
   - Item 8: Agent 0 (77 is the highest)

4. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Ensure that each agent gets a fair number of items, and adjust accordingly if needed to balance the allocations.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Check and ensure that the allocation is fair by adjusting any potential over-allocation to balance the number of items.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while maintaining a balance in the number of items allocated to each agent.
