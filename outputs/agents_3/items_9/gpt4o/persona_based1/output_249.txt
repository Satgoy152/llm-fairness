Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  85  70   0  25   5  87  50  95
1  79  48  77   3  62  51  36  59  89
2  58  31  51  75  90  33  26  23  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 85 70  0 25  5 87 50 95]
 [79 48 77  3 62 51 36 59 89]
 [58 31 51 75 90 33 26 23 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the allocation according to the agents' preferences. Given the values each agent assigns to the items, we can use a method to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their respective valuations.

The values are:

```
Agent 0: [66, 85, 70, 0, 25, 5, 87, 50, 95]
Agent 1: [79, 48, 77, 3, 62, 51, 36, 59, 89]
Agent 2: [58, 31, 51, 75, 90, 33, 26, 23, 19]
```

Let's proceed with a heuristic approach to allocate the items considering the highest available valuation for each item, while ensuring that each agent gets at least some items to make sure no agent feels entirely left out. 

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, prioritizing items with the highest individual agent valuations to minimize envy.
2. If there's a tie (two or more agents value an item equally), randomly assign the item or use additional criteria such as ensuring a more balanced distribution of items among agents.

Following these steps, we arrive at:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (79)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (85)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (77)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (75)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (90)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (51)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (87)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 1 (59)
- Item 8: Highest value by Agent 0 (95)

This allocation appears to be the most balanced in terms of respecting the agents' valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 5, 7],
    "2": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations, attempting to achieve a fair and envy-free division.
