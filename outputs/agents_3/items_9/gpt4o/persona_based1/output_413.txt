Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  56  21  59  14  54  83  78  85
1  20  96  36  14  25   2  36  16  76
2  70  20  92   5  29  34  27   1  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division while considering envy-freeness, we can use an algorithm like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach. However, for simplicity, we will manually allocate items to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items and the value each item has for each agent:

1. Total values for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 511
   - Agent 1: 321
   - Agent 2: 328

2. Fairness involves ensuring that the distribution of items maximizes the minimum satisfaction across agents, relative to their valuations.

A possible allocation considering these factors could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 8
- Agent 2 receives items: 2, 4, 5, 6

Let's check this allocation:

- Agent 0: 
  - Items: 0 (71), 3 (59), 7 (78)
  - Total value: 208

- Agent 1: 
  - Items: 1 (96), 8 (76)
  - Total value: 172

- Agent 2: 
  - Items: 2 (92), 4 (29), 5 (34), 6 (27)
  - Total value: 182

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items. The allocation is also envy-free to a significant extent, given the individual item valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```
