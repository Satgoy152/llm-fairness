Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  70  31  35  75  65  11  78  59
1  74  22  23  68  52  76  73  84  20
2  21  16  39  26  83  75  70  24  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is relatively balanced. Given that we have 9 items and 3 agents, ideally, each agent should receive 3 items. Let's attempt a distribution based on maximizing each agent's perceived value.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 7
   - Valuation: 78 (Item 0) + 35 (Item 3) + 78 (Item 7) = 191

2. **Agent 1**: Items 1, 5, 6
   - Valuation: 22 (Item 1) + 76 (Item 5) + 73 (Item 6) = 171

3. **Agent 2**: Items 2, 4, 8
   - Valuation: 39 (Item 2) + 83 (Item 4) + 86 (Item 8) = 208

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, considering their preferences. Now, I'll present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 8]
}
```
