Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  43   6   2  98  70  82  99  15
1  66  97   7  90  82  51  60   0  87
2  30  24  13  46  29  40  31  23  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or at least an envy-minimized allocation. This involves ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items.

   - Agent 0: \(56 + 43 + 6 + 2 + 98 + 70 + 82 + 99 + 15 = 471\)
   - Agent 1: \(66 + 97 + 7 + 90 + 82 + 51 + 60 + 0 + 87 = 540\)
   - Agent 2: \(30 + 24 + 13 + 46 + 29 + 40 + 31 + 23 + 97 = 333\)

2. **Fair Share Calculation**: Each agent should ideally receive items whose total valuation is proportionate to their total valuation compared to other agents. The fair share in terms of total valuation is:

   - Total sum of valuations = \(471 + 540 + 333 = 1344\)
   - Fair share for Agent 0 = \(471 / 1344 \approx 35.0\%\)
   - Fair share for Agent 1 = \(540 / 1344 \approx 40.2\%\)
   - Fair share for Agent 2 = \(333 / 1344 \approx 24.8\%\)

3. **Allocate Items Greedily**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation until their fair share is approximately met.

4. **Allocation**:

   - **Agent 0**:
     - Items: 7 (99), 4 (98), 6 (82)
     - Total value = \(99 + 98 + 82 = 279\)
     - This is about 59.2% of their total valuation, which is higher than their fair share but adjustable based on remaining allocations.

   - **Agent 1**:
     - Items: 1 (97), 3 (90), 8 (87)
     - Total value = \(97 + 90 + 87 = 274\)
     - This is about 50.7% of their total valuation, slightly above the fair share but balanced with other allocations.

   - **Agent 2**:
     - Items: 5 (40), 2 (13), 0 (30)
     - Total value = \(40 + 13 + 30 = 83\)
     - This is about 24.9% of their total valuation, closely matching their fair share.

5. **Final Check**: Ensure that all 9 items are allocated and each agent has a reasonable share.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 8],
    "2": [5, 2, 0]
}
```
