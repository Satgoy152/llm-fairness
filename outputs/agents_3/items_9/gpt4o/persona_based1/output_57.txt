Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69   0   8  95  44  95  10  18  90
1  48  78  90  49  50  66  87  93  46
2  99  32  70  45  64  21  93  55  49
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. We will try to balance the total valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 69 + 0 + 8 + 95 + 44 + 95 + 10 + 18 + 90 = 429
- Agent 1: 48 + 78 + 90 + 49 + 50 + 66 + 87 + 93 + 46 = 607
- Agent 2: 99 + 32 + 70 + 45 + 64 + 21 + 93 + 55 + 49 = 528

Now, let's try to distribute the items to achieve a more balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 3 (95), 5 (95), 8 (90)
   - Total valuation: 95 + 95 + 90 = 280

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1 (78), 2 (90), 7 (93)
   - Total valuation: 78 + 90 + 93 = 261

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 0 (99), 4 (64), 6 (93)
   - Total valuation: 99 + 64 + 93 = 256

Now let's represent the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a total valuation that is relatively balanced, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
