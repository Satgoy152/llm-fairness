Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49   7  16  19  43  30  80  94  56
1  63  19  14  16  37  94   6  99  22
2  11  37  44  78  89  61  11  97  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can try to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive and attempt to minimize envy by balancing the allocations.

Let's calculate a potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 6, 7, and 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 5, 7, and 0 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 4, 3, and 7 highly.

We can start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent and adjusting from there to balance the allocations:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 7 to agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1, but also very high for Agent 2).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [6] (80 total value)
- Agent 1: [7] (99 total value)
- Agent 2: [4] (89 total value)

Continuing with the next highest valued items for each agent while avoiding envy and ensuring a reasonable distribution:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (second-highest valuation, but much less than for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (high valuation for Agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (second-highest valuation).

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [6] (80 total value)
- Agent 1: [7, 0, 5] (256 total value)
- Agent 2: [4, 3] (167 total value)

Balance the remaining items for fairness:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (reasonable value and balances allocations).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (completes allocation).

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [6, 2] (80 + 16 = 96 total value)
- Agent 1: [7, 0, 5] (99 + 63 + 94 = 256 total value)
- Agent 2: [4, 3, 1, 8] (89 + 78 + 37 + 28 = 232 total value)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [7, 0, 5],
    "2": [4, 3, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance total valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
