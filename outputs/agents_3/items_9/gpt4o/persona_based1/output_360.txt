Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9   8  48  27  10  92  45  55  43
1   7  82  89  29   9  72  77  38  86
2  61  38  12  83   9  72  34  51  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method called "round robin" or "sequential allocation". This method involves iteratively allowing each agent to pick their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated.

Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

1. **Start with Agent 0**: Agent 0 will pick the item they value the most.
2. **Proceed to Agent 1**: Agent 1 picks their most valued remaining item.
3. **Proceed to Agent 2**: Agent 2 picks their most valued remaining item.
4. Repeat the process, cycling back to Agent 0, until all items are allocated.

Let's implement this strategy:

- **Round 1**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value: 92)
  - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value: 89)
  - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value: 83)

- **Round 2**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value: 55)
  - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value: 86)
  - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value: 61)

- **Round 3**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value: 45)
  - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value: 82)
  - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value: 9)

Now, all items have been allocated, and each agent has received 3 items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 6],
    "1": [2, 8, 1],
    "2": [3, 0, 4]
}
```

Each agent gets three items, and this distribution attempts to maximize fairness based on their individual valuations.
