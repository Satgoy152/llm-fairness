Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  23  37  36  44  24  22  25   6
1  59  16   5  20  35  39  84  91   8
2  36  57  28  97  83  76  45   8  60
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. One common approach is to use an algorithm like the Envy-Free Matching or the Adjusted Winner procedure, but given that this is a discrete allocation problem, we can use a heuristic approach to balance the total values as much as possible.

Here are the steps and considerations in allocating the items:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0: Total value = 277
   - Agent 1: Total value = 357
   - Agent 2: Total value = 490

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items to agents such that each agent gets a set of items whose total value is as close as possible to being equal.

3. **Iterative Adjustments**: Adjust allocations to minimize envy and ensure each agent's total valuation is balanced relative to others.

After analyzing the valuations, here is a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 5]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 60 + 37 + 24 = 121
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 6, 7]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 20 + 84 + 91 = 195
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 4, 8]
  - Total valuation for Agent 2 = 57 + 83 + 60 = 200

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
