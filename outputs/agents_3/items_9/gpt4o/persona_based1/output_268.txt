Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  32  98  29  23  70  64  96  80
1  60  58  72  58  61  26  15   2   8
2   4  38  78  78  66  93   3   6  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent believes they have received the best or an equally desirable set of items given their valuations. Since we have 3 agents and 9 items, we'll aim to give each agent 3 items.

Let's assess the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 7.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 4, and 2 highly, but not more than Agent 0 for item 2.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest, followed by items 3 and 4.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign items 0, 2, and 7 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
2. Assign items 1, 4, and 8 to Agent 1. Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 1, and items 1 and 8 are the next best given the remaining items after Agent 0's allocation.
3. Assign items 3, 5, and 6 to Agent 2. Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 2, and items 3 and 6 are the next best remaining items.

This allocation ensures each agent gets 3 items and aims for envy-freeness based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
