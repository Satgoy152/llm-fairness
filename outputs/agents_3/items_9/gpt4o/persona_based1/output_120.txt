Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  56  98  87  86  77  37  91  75
1  98  41  83  39  24  27  41  71  41
2  94   4  63  85  94  21  30  64   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items that they value highly. For instance, items 2, 3, and 7 are highly valued by Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: We can allocate items that Agent 1 values more than other agents. For example, items 0 and 8.

3. **Agent 2**: We can allocate items that Agent 2 values more than other agents. For example, items 4, 5, and 6.

After considering the above distribution, we still have item 1 left to allocate. Let's give item 1 to Agent 1 since they have a relatively lower total valuation from the initial allocation.

Here's the allocation based on the above logic:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 8, 1
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5, 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [0, 8, 1],
    "2": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
