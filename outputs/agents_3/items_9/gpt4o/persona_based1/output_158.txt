Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  73  66  30  98  30  54  68  50
1  62  61  33   6  22  92   5  71  49
2  31  68  25  79  29  26  25  23  85
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy, where each agent values their assigned bundle of items as highly as possible relative to others. Given the valuations provided, we can use an algorithmic approach to optimize these allocations. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would have if they received no items, which is essentially zero.

2. Iteratively allocate items to the agent who values the available item the most, provided it doesn't result in an overly unfair distribution.

3. Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has a notably high valuation for item 4 (98). 
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5 (92) and 0 (62).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 8 (85) and item 3 (79).

Following a fair allocation strategy, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to agent 2.
- Continue with other assignments while balancing valuations.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 1, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 0, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [8, 3, 2]

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items they highly value, minimizing potential envy.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 6],
    "1": [5, 0, 7],
    "2": [8, 3, 2]
}
```
