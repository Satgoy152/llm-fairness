Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  83  95  42  88   8  75  77  26
1  53  62  41  82  83  54  73  78  25
2  42  73  56  26  31  90  79  68  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy and ensures a fair distribution. One approach to this problem is the Envy-Free allocation, which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 75, 83, 95, 42, 88, 8, 75, 77, 26
- Agent 1 values: 53, 62, 41, 82, 83, 54, 73, 78, 25
- Agent 2 values: 42, 73, 56, 26, 31, 90, 79, 68, 93

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Approach**: Start by assigning items based on each agent's highest valuations to ensure they receive the items they value the most.

2. **Distribution Balance**: Ensure that each agent gets an approximately equal number of items.

3. **Envy Reduction**: Adjust allocations to reduce envy by swapping items if necessary.

**Allocation Steps:**

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, followed by item 4 and item 1.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, followed by item 4 and item 7.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the highest, followed by item 5 and item 6.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. Assign high-value items to each agent:
   - Agent 0: [2, 1]
   - Agent 1: [3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [8, 5]

2. Balance the number of items:
   - Agent 0: [2, 1, 0] (adding item 0)
   - Agent 1: [3, 4, 7] (adding item 7)
   - Agent 2: [8, 5, 6] (adding item 6)

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items they value at 95, 83, and 75.
- Agent 1 gets items they value at 82, 83, and 78.
- Agent 2 gets items they value at 93, 90, and 79.

This allocation is balanced, with each agent receiving 3 items, and each agent gets some of their highest-valued items.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [8, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value while keeping the distribution balanced.
