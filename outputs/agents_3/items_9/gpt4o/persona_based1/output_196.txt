Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  66  22  18  88  32  74   3  75
1  51  67  11  82  39  32  69  92  89
2   9  73  39   4  95  93  62  94  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness is achieved when no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent will receive exactly 3 items.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers items with high valuations such as 0 (value 65), 1 (value 66), and 8 (value 75).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers items with high valuations such as 3 (value 82), 7 (value 92), and 6 (value 69).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Prefers items with high valuations such as 4 (value 95), 5 (value 93), and 2 (value 39).

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly, reducing envy among them. Each agent receives exactly 3 items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 7, 6],
    "2": [4, 5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming towards a fair and envy-free distribution.
