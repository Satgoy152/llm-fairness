Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  20  80  24  55  79  97  86  73
1  58  80  83  16  11  95  39  16  98
2  68  48  32  81  70  74  21  74   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness and an equitable distribution based on the given valuations. We will use a method that balances the total value received by each agent according to their preferences.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 90 + 20 + 80 + 24 + 55 + 79 + 97 + 86 + 73 = 604
- Agent 1: 58 + 80 + 83 + 16 + 11 + 95 + 39 + 16 + 98 = 496
- Agent 2: 68 + 48 + 32 + 81 + 70 + 74 + 21 + 74 + 3 = 471

We will attempt to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is as evenly distributed as possible, with each agent receiving close to one-third of the total value of the items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High preference for items 6, 0, 7
   - Allocate items 6, 0, 7 to Agent 0.
   - Total value for Agent 0: 97 + 90 + 86 = 273

2. **Agent 1**: High preference for items 8, 5, 2
   - Allocate items 8, 5, 2 to Agent 1.
   - Total value for Agent 1: 98 + 95 + 83 = 276

3. **Agent 2**: Remaining items 3, 4, 1
   - Allocate items 3, 4, 1 to Agent 2.
   - Total value for Agent 2: 81 + 70 + 48 = 199

The allocation is balanced based on the high preferences of each agent, and each agent receives at least 3 items. Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 7],
    "1": [8, 5, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest valuations of each agent, while ensuring all items are distributed.
