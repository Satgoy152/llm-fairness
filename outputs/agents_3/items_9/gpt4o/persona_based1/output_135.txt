Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  19  85  69  24  15  23  21  72
1  22  94  27  47  55  23  29  74  89
2  63  84  97  45  52  72  77   7  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. This is a challenging problem, but we can attempt to find a reasonable allocation given the constraints.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(22 + 19 + 85 + 69 + 24 + 15 + 23 + 21 + 72 = 350\)
- Agent 1: \(22 + 94 + 27 + 47 + 55 + 23 + 29 + 74 + 89 = 460\)
- Agent 2: \(63 + 84 + 97 + 45 + 52 + 72 + 77 + 7 + 52 = 549\)

Given this, we consider each agent's preferences for individual items. One approach is to start by assigning items that are most valuable to each agent, ensuring that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

### Initial Allocation Strategy:
1. **Assign the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (85).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (97), but since item 2 is already taken by Agent 0, we look at the next highest, which is item 6 (77).

2. **Continue assigning highly valued items while ensuring at least one item per agent:**
   - Agent 0: Next highest is item 3 (69).
   - Agent 1: Next highest is item 8 (89).
   - Agent 2: Next highest is item 5 (72).

3. **Fill the allocation until all items are distributed:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 4, 7.

### Final Allocation:
Assign remaining items while considering balance across agents:
- Agent 0 gets item 0 (22).
- Agent 1 gets item 7 (74).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (52).

This results in each agent receiving 3 items, and all items are distributed.

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0],
    "1": [1, 8, 7],
    "2": [6, 5, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they highly value, while balancing the distribution of total items. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness is often not possible without using fractional allocations, but this arrangement aims to minimize envy given the constraints of the problem.
