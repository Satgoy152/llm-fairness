Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76   0  75  77  28  65  35  66  37
1  50  80  18  60  10  33  41  86  27
2   7  67   6  56  49  36  43   3  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[76  0 75 77 28 65 35 66 37]

 [ 7 67  6 56 49 36 43  3 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their personal valuations.

Given the valuations provided, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items (total valuation for all items): 76, 0, 75, 77, 28, 65, 35, 66, 37
- Agent 1 values items (total valuation for all items): 50, 80, 18, 60, 10, 33, 41, 86, 27
- Agent 2 values items (total valuation for all items): 7, 67, 6, 56, 49, 36, 43, 3, 46

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to distribute the items such that the total valuation received by each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's begin by assigning items with the highest individual value to each agent, then fill in the gaps with lower-valued items to maintain balance.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent based on their personal valuations.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the total value for each agent.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (77) and item 0 (76). Let's give these items to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (80) and item 7 (86). Let's give these items to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 (67 in comparison to others). Since item 1 is already taken, Agent 2 will receive its next highest valued items: item 3 (56) and item 8 (46).

**Allocate remaining items to balance total valuation:**

- Remaining items: 2, 4, 5, 6

Assign these items to agents to achieve a balanced total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives item 6 (35) and item 4 (28).
- Agent 1 receives item 2 (18).
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (36).

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 6, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 7, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [8, 5]

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives according to their own valuation function.

**JSON representation of the final allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6, 4],
    "1": [1, 7, 2],
    "2": [8, 5]
}
```
