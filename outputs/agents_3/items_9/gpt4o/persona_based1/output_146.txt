Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  59  83  47  59  14  47  41  81
1  80  60  14   8  73  34  52  91  50
2  82  41  47  37  84  20  81  94  47
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, we consider each agent's valuations and attempt to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share given their preferences.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then aim to balance these values across the agents as closely as possible.

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: 92 + 59 + 83 + 47 + 59 + 14 + 47 + 41 + 81 = 523
- **Agent 1**: 80 + 60 + 14 + 8 + 73 + 34 + 52 + 91 + 50 = 462
- **Agent 2**: 82 + 41 + 47 + 37 + 84 + 20 + 81 + 94 + 47 = 533

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** (Highest total valuation: 523) should receive items that maximize their satisfaction but not significantly disadvantage others.
2. **Agent 1** (Lowest total valuation: 462) should receive items that maximize their satisfaction given their relatively lower valuation.
3. **Agent 2** (Moderate total valuation: 533) should receive items to balance their high valuation.

### Allocation Process:
1. Allocate high-value items to each agent to ensure they get a fair share. 
2. Ensure each agent gets three items since there are nine items in total.

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: Assign items that Agent 0 values highly but are not the highest valued for others.
  - Items: 0 (92), 2 (83), 8 (81)
  - Total value: 92 + 83 + 81 = 256

- **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values highly.
  - Items: 4 (73), 7 (91), 1 (60)
  - Total value: 73 + 91 + 60 = 224

- **Agent 2**: Assign remaining items, ensuring Agent 2 also gets a valuable share.
  - Items: 6 (81), 3 (37), 5 (20)
  - Total value: 81 + 37 + 20 = 138

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [4, 7, 1],
    "2": [6, 3, 5]
}
```
