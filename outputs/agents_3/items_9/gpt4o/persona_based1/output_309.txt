Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  78  69  62  52  35  76  16  31
1  77   7  14  11  22  22  52  75  17
2  36  34  33  56  70  20   7  56  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 78 69 62 52 35 76 16 31]
 [77  7 14 11 22 22 52 75 17]
 [36 34 33 56 70 20  7 56 38]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will use the idea of maximizing the total satisfaction of each agent while ensuring an envy-free allocation to the extent possible. An envy-free allocation guarantees that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [55, 78, 69, 62, 52, 35, 76, 16, 31]
- Agent 1: [77, 7, 14, 11, 22, 22, 52, 75, 17]
- Agent 2: [36, 34, 33, 56, 70, 20, 7, 56, 38]

Let's allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (78), 6 (76), 2 (69)
   - Allocate items 1, 6, 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining high-value items: 0 (77), 7 (75), 6 (52)
   - Allocate items 0, 7, and re-evaluate since 6 is already allocated, so the next is 5 (22) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining high-value items: 4 (70), 3 (56), 7 (56)
   - Allocate items 4, 3, and since 7 is already allocated, choose the next highest remaining value for Agent 2: 8 (38).

The allocation ensures each agent gets items that are relatively high in value according to their preferences, minimizing envy as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 6, 2: [78, 76, 69]
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 7, 5: [77, 75, 22]
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 3, 8: [70, 56, 38]

Now, present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 2],
    "1": [0, 7, 5],
    "2": [4, 3, 8]
}
```
