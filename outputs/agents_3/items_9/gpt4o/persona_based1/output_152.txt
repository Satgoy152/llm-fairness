Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  85  37  37  38   5   9  61  64
1  17   8  99  48  26  88  41  13  12
2  47   8   6   9  12  46  69  57  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's valuation of their assigned items while ensuring that all items are allocated. The goal is to make each agent feel that they are not worse off compared to others based on their valuation.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item by Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: [25, 85, 37, 37, 38, 5, 9, 61, 64]
   - Agent 1: [17, 8, 99, 48, 26, 88, 41, 13, 12]
   - Agent 2: [47, 8, 6, 9, 12, 46, 69, 57, 61]

2. **Assign Items to Agents:**
   - To ensure fairness and minimize envy, we will allocate each item to the agent that values it the most.
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (47)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (85)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (48)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (38)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (88)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 2 (69)
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 0 (61)
   - Item 8: Highest value by Agent 2 (61)

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 4, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 5]
   - Agent 2: Items [0, 6, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent gets the items they value the most, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has received an integer number of items.
