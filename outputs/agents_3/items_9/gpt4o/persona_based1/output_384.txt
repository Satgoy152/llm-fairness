Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  46  86   0  14   5   5  70  94
1  47  31   4  61  33  75  43  60  93
2  75  35  91  43  46  42  49  81  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that all items are allocated. A common approach is to use an optimization method or heuristic strategy to balance the allocations.

Let's allocate the items based on the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (94), Item 2 (86), Item 7 (70)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (93), Item 5 (75), Item 3 (61)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 1. Since Item 8 is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider other high-value items.
   - Allocate Item 5 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 0 (75), Item 7 (81)
   - Allocate these items to Agent 2. Since Item 2 and Item 7 are already allocated to Agent 0, we consider other high-value items.
   - Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 2.

Let's finalize the allocation ensuring all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 7, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 1, 4

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring no items remain unallocated.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
