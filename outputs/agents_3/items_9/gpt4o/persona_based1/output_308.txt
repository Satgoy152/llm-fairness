Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  88  99   4  89  49   1  67  82
1   0  64  16  41  12  60  21  94   7
2  66   9  19  25  89  24  90  22  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, meaning no agent should prefer someone else's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items so that the total value for each agent is balanced according to their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [52, 88, 99, 4, 89, 49, 1, 67, 82]
   - Agent 1: [0, 64, 16, 41, 12, 60, 21, 94, 7]
   - Agent 2: [66, 9, 19, 25, 89, 24, 90, 22, 76]

2. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Total value for Agent 0: 531
   - Total value for Agent 1: 315
   - Total value for Agent 2: 420

3. **Determine Fair Share:**
   - The aim is to have each agent receive items that sum up to approximately one-third of their total valuation (since we have 3 agents).

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items for each agent, respecting the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items.

5. **Make Adjustments to Balance Value:**
   - Rebalance if any agent feels envious of another.

Here is one possible allocation that respects these principles:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  - Total value: 243 (52 + 88 + 99 + 4)

- **Agent 1**: [4, 5, 7]
  - Total value: 166 (12 + 60 + 94)

- **Agent 2**: [6, 8]
  - Total value: 166 (90 + 76)

This allocation tries to balance the total values each agent receives, based on their own valuations. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [6, 8]
}
```
