Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  70  28  42  64  20  77  25  60
1  88  51  19  32  23  32  44  77  59
2  37  76  71  27  39  94  80  90  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One commonly used concept in fair division is "envy-freeness." An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own bundle.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent \ Item: 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0           : 81  70  28  42  64  20  77  25  60
1           : 88  51  19  32  23  32  44  77  59
2           : 37  76  71  27  39  94  80  90  63
```

We can consider the following steps to reach an envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:** Sum the valuations for all items for each agent to gauge their total worth.

    - Agent 0: 81 + 70 + 28 + 42 + 64 + 20 + 77 + 25 + 60 = 467
    - Agent 1: 88 + 51 + 19 + 32 + 23 + 32 + 44 + 77 + 59 = 425
    - Agent 2: 37 + 76 + 71 + 27 + 39 + 94 + 80 + 90 + 63 = 577

2. **Determine Fair Share:** Each agent should ideally get a share of the total value proportional to the number of items. With 9 items in total, each agent should get an average of 3 items. However, the specific items should maximize their valuations while minimizing envy.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
     - Items 0, 1, and 6 are highly valued by Agent 0 (81, 70, 77).
   - **Agent 1:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
     - Items 0, 7, and 8 are highly valued by Agent 1 (88, 77, 59).
   - **Agent 2:** Prioritize items with the highest valuation.
     - Items 5, 6, and 7 are highly valued by Agent 2 (94, 80, 90).

   By iterating over combinations, we find a distribution that ensures no agent envies another.

4. **Final Allocation:** After examining possible allocations, we arrive at a distribution that attempts to balance the individual valuations as much as possible.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and the distribution aims to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
