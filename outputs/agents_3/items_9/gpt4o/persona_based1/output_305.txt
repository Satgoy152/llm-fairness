Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  62  26  70  63  45  46  56  47
1  21  39  96  65  50  57  54  92  31
2  96  39  50  44   2  85  94  21  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

We'll approach this by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items and aiming to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible given their preferences.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: 40 + 62 + 26 + 70 + 63 + 45 + 46 + 56 + 47 = 455
- Agent 1: 21 + 39 + 96 + 65 + 50 + 57 + 54 + 92 + 31 = 505
- Agent 2: 96 + 39 + 50 + 44 + 2 + 85 + 94 + 21 + 70 = 501

The goal is to allocate items in a way that balances their perceived value as much as possible. 

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation per Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (value 96)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 62)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 96)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value 70)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (value 63)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 85)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (value 94)
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (value 92)
   - Item 8: Agent 2 (value 70)

2. **Rebalancing to Ensure Each Agent Gets an Integer Number of Items:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 7]
   - Agent 2: Items [0, 5, 6, 8]

This initial allocation respects the agents' preferences and ensures each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their individual utility without creating envy. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
