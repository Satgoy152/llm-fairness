Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  21  42  33  78  51  59  77  57
1  63  62  12  63  61  14  93  46  71
2  81   2  87  94  28  45  95  41  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as balanced as possible. We can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities of the agents.

Here's a potential allocation that aims to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 4, 5
   - Total value: 93 (item 0) + 78 (item 4) + 51 (item 5) = 222

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 6, 8
   - Total value: 62 (item 1) + 93 (item 6) + 71 (item 8) = 226

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 3, 7
   - Total value: 87 (item 2) + 94 (item 3) + 41 (item 7) = 222

This allocation considers the preferences of each agent and attempts to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced. This is a way to approach fairness and potentially achieve envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
