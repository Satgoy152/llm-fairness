Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  85  69  10  55  39  18  77  26
1   2  33   7  35  71  59  34  64   5
2  44   5  75  37  11  53   7  49  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and find a distribution where no agent envies another, if possible. This can be quite complex, but we can aim for a balanced distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while maintaining a fair distribution overall.

### Valuations Table

The valuations for each agent are as follows:

- **Agent 0**: 16, 85, 69, 10, 55, 39, 18, 77, 26
- **Agent 1**: 2, 33, 7, 35, 71, 59, 34, 64, 5
- **Agent 2**: 44, 5, 75, 37, 11, 53, 7, 49, 51

### Strategy for Allocation

1. **Maximize Individual Happiness**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations first, ensuring no single agent gets all high-valued items.
2. **Balance the Allocation**: Make sure each agent ends up with a similar total valuation of items to keep envy to a minimum.

### Proposed Allocation

After considering the valuations, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 4, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 5, 7]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 6]

### Justification

- **Agent 0** is assigned items [1, 4, 8] with values 85, 55, and 26 respectively, totaling 166.
- **Agent 1** is assigned items [3, 5, 7] with values 35, 59, and 64 respectively, totaling 158.
- **Agent 2** is assigned items [0, 2, 6] with values 44, 75, and 7 respectively, totaling 126.

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free but seeks to balance the total valuation across agents as much as possible, given the constraints of integer item distribution.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 8],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9, as required.
