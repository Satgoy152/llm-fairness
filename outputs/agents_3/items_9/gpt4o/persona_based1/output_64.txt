Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  40   8  58  39  88  74  62  93
1  23  10  42  42  43  94  65  45  41
2  21  17  14  32  58  36  70  81   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that aims to be fair and envy-free, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Since this problem has three agents and nine items, a simple equal division might not work perfectly, but we can attempt to maximize fairness.

First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 11 + 40 + 8 + 58 + 39 + 88 + 74 + 62 + 93 = 473
- Agent 1: 23 + 10 + 42 + 42 + 43 + 94 + 65 + 45 + 41 = 365
- Agent 2: 21 + 17 + 14 + 32 + 58 + 36 + 70 + 81 + 8 = 337

Each agent ideally should get items that sum up to approximately one-third of their total valuation. Let's try to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items like 5 (88), 8 (93), and 7 (62). Let's allocate these first as they contribute significantly to their total valuation.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items like 5 (94), 6 (65), and 4 (43). However, item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we need to prioritize other high-value items.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items like 7 (81), 6 (70), and 4 (58). Items 7 and 6 are already allocated, so we have to distribute remaining items taking this into account.

Based on this analysis, let's attempt an allocation that seems fair:

- Agent 0: [5, 8]
- Agent 1: [2, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 3, 7]

This distribution tries to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also keeping the total number of items per agent as balanced as possible. Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
