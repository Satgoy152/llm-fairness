Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  44  31  84  92  38  89  39  87
1  71  10  45  40  18  29  79  32   0
2  72  74  18  25  32  30  13  35  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each gets a fair share based on their preferences. Given the nature of this problem, let's aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a total value that is as fair as possible, given the constraints.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 78 + 44 + 31 + 84 + 92 + 38 + 89 + 39 + 87 = 582
- Agent 1: 71 + 10 + 45 + 40 + 18 + 29 + 79 + 32 + 0 = 324
- Agent 2: 72 + 74 + 18 + 25 + 32 + 30 + 13 + 35 + 77 = 376

Now, let's allocate the items considering the following approach:
1. Each agent should get items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.
2. Try to balance the total value each agent receives based on their total valuations.

Based on these considerations, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [4, 8, 0]
- Agent 1 gets items: [6, 3, 5]
- Agent 2 gets items: [1, 7, 2]

Let's verify this allocation:

- Agent 0 values items [4, 8, 0] as: 92 + 87 + 78 = 257
- Agent 1 values items [6, 3, 5] as: 79 + 40 + 29 = 148
- Agent 2 values items [1, 7, 2] as: 74 + 35 + 18 = 127

Each agent receives a set of items that is a fair share based on their individual valuations. The allocation is as balanced as possible given the input constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8, 0],
    "1": [6, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 7, 2]
}
```
