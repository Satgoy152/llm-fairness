Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  76   5  89  78  62  58  90  29
1  58  80  77  33  50  42  31  61  19
2  41  75   0  24  90  34  29  60   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, which means no agent should prefer someone else's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given the constraints, it's challenging to achieve perfect envy-freeness, especially in discrete allocations, but we can strive to minimize envy.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with high valuations for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with high valuations for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with high valuations for Agent 2.

Let's try to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 3 at 89, item 7 at 90.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 at 80, item 2 at 77.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 at 90.

Given these preferences, we can assign the other items by attempting to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 7, 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 4, 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and we attempt to maximize their value according to their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, but it aims to minimize dissatisfaction among agents based on their valuations.
