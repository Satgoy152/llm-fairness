Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  88  41  51  45  56  82  65  50
1  75  84  88  89  74  60  15  98  21
2  18  42  66  83  68  74  69  49  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among them. Envy-freeness means each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated, we will attempt to balance the total value of items each agent receives based on their valuations.

Below is the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 51 + 88 + 41 + 51 + 45 + 56 + 82 + 65 + 50 = 529
   - Agent 1: 75 + 84 + 88 + 89 + 74 + 60 + 15 + 98 + 21 = 604
   - Agent 2: 18 + 42 + 66 + 83 + 68 + 74 + 69 + 49 + 63 = 532

2. **Rank Items by Value for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: [1, 6, 7, 5, 0, 3, 8, 4, 2]
   - Agent 1: [7, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 5, 8, 6]
   - Agent 2: [5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 1, 0]

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - Start by giving each agent their highest-valued items, ensuring all items are assigned and no agent has more than 3 items (since there are 9 items total and 3 agents).

   - **Agent 0**: Items [1, 6, 8]
   - **Agent 1**: Items [3, 7, 0]
   - **Agent 2**: Items [5, 2, 4]

   Each agent receives 3 items, and all items are allocated.

Finally, the allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [3, 7, 0],
    "2": [5, 2, 4]
}
```
