Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  46  98  19   8  97  60  25  89
1  99  34  66  33   2  36  13  53  47
2  31  72  91  77  63  90  44  50  33
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we want to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their individual valuations. Given the valuations matrix, let's aim for a fair division by trying to balance the total value that each agent receives.

### Valuations Matrix

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 | Item 8 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 29     | 46     | 98     | 19     | 8      | 97     | 60     | 25     | 89     |
| 1     | 99     | 34     | 66     | 33     | 2      | 36     | 13     | 53     | 47     |
| 2     | 31     | 72     | 91     | 77     | 63     | 90     | 44     | 50     | 33     |

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 2 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 3, 5, and 2.

Considering the highest values and aiming for a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 2 and 5 (value: 98 + 97 = 195).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 0 and 7 (value: 99 + 53 = 152).
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 3, 4, 6, 1, and 8 (value: 77 + 63 + 44 + 72 + 33 = 289).

### Allocations

Now, let's format these allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 6, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives based on their own preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated. Note that this solution does not guarantee perfect envy-freeness but aims to distribute the items in a fair manner based on the given valuations.
