Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  18  11  74   6  51  62  77  14
1  46  35  90  12  41  50  38  81  60
2  14  98  57  45  99  64   7  11  63
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and tries to provide each agent with items they value highly. A common approach is to use the "envy-free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which is often more practical in discrete settings.

The agents' total valuations for all items are:
- Agent 0: 333
- Agent 1: 453
- Agent 2: 458

Here's a step-by-step allocation process to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Select items that maximize Agent 0's valuation:
   - Choose item 7 (value 77)
   - Choose item 3 (value 74)
   - Choose item 6 (value 62)
   - Choose item 5 (value 51)
   
   Total value for Agent 0: 77 + 74 + 62 + 51 = 264

2. **Agent 1**: Select items that maximize Agent 1's valuation from the remaining:
   - Choose item 2 (value 90)
   - Choose item 8 (value 60)
   - Choose item 0 (value 46)

   Total value for Agent 1: 90 + 60 + 46 = 196

3. **Agent 2**: Assign the remaining items to Agent 2:
   - Choose item 4 (value 99)
   - Choose item 1 (value 98)

   Total value for Agent 2: 99 + 98 = 197

Now, each agent has been allocated items, and all items have been distributed. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 8],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring the items are distributed to minimize envy as best as possible under the given conditions.
