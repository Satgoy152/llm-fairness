Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  95  18  13  88  21  25  57  28
1  81  16  44   6  51  91  69  44  65
2  65  74  45   8  28  62  49  64  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we need to consider both the values each agent assigns to the items and the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items being allocated. One possible approach is to use a round-robin method based on each agent's highest preferences or a similar fair division method.

Let's try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value assigned to each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high values: 1, 4, 0
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items with high values: 5, 8, 6
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items with high values: 8, 7, 1

We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total value is balanced, and no agent feels they have been unfairly treated.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4, 3]
  - Total value = 95 + 88 + 13 = 196

- **Agent 1**: [5, 6, 0]
  - Total value = 91 + 69 + 81 = 241

- **Agent 2**: [8, 7, 2]
  - Total value = 75 + 64 + 45 = 184

While this allocation might not be perfectly envy-free, it strives to balance the total values across agents given the discrete and limited items.

**Final Allocation JSON:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [5, 6, 0],
    "2": [8, 7, 2]
}
```
