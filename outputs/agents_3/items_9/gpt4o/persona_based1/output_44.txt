Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  39  86  89  46   0  39  58  52
1  64  76  47  71  76  67  30   3  63
2  13  10  67  28   0  76  20  60  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can utilize a combination of the adjusted winner procedure and balancing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items 3, 2, and 8, as these have the highest valuations.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items 1, 4, and 0, which have relatively high valuations for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items 5, 7, and 6, based on the highest valuations for this agent.

Here's the allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 3: Value = 89
  - Item 2: Value = 86
  - Item 8: Value = 52
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1: Value = 76
  - Item 4: Value = 76
  - Item 0: Value = 64
- **Agent 2**:
  - Item 5: Value = 76
  - Item 7: Value = 60
  - Item 6: Value = 20

Each agent receives three items, and the allocation seeks to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 0],
    "2": [5, 7, 6]
}
```
