Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  62  54  51  40  86  94  89   1
1  57  22  76  76  68  36  93  68  52
2  28  30  98   8  29  34  32  22  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 62 54 51 40 86 94 89  1]
 [57 22 76 76 68 36 93 68 52]
 [28 30 98  8 29 34 32 22 26]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. 

Here is one possible fair allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: [5, 6, 7]
   - Total Valuation: 86 + 94 + 89 = 269

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: [2, 3, 4]
   - Total Valuation: 76 + 76 + 68 = 220

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: [0, 1, 8]
   - Total Valuation: 28 + 30 + 26 = 84

This allocation gives each agent a distinct set of items, with the aim of balancing out their total valuations to ensure fairness. Note that while the total valuations are not exactly equal, the allocation respects the preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Now, let's present the allocation in JSON format as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 8]
}
```
