Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  67  72  97  87  24  35  23  68
1   2  54  44  54  96  73  61  50  92
2  66  34  63   0  56  65   1  13  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they receive a fair share. In this context, achieving exact envy-freeness can be complex, but we can aim for a reasonable allocation that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items** to determine how much each agent values the entire set of items.
2. **Use these valuations to guide the allocation**, ensuring that no agent receives a significantly less valuable set of items compared to their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 53 + 67 + 72 + 97 + 87 + 24 + 35 + 23 + 68 = 526
- Agent 1: 2 + 54 + 44 + 54 + 96 + 73 + 61 + 50 + 92 = 526
- Agent 2: 66 + 34 + 63 + 0 + 56 + 65 + 1 + 13 + 37 = 335

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 3 (97), 4 (87), and 2 (72).
- **Agent 1** highly values items 4 (96), 8 (92), and 5 (73).
- **Agent 2** values items 0 (66), 2 (63), and 5 (65) significantly.

Since all agents have the same total valuation but different preferences for individual items, we can try to balance the allocation by considering their highest preferences and spreading them out.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 3, 7]. Total valuation: 53 + 97 + 23 = 173.
- **Agent 1** receives items [4, 5, 8]. Total valuation: 96 + 73 + 92 = 261.
- **Agent 2** receives items [1, 2, 6]. Total valuation: 34 + 63 + 1 = 98.

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent and tries to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
