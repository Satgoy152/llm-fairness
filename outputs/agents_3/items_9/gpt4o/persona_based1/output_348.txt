Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  27  13  93  77  57   8  28  83
1  91  72  76   4  38  61  64  99  18
2  70   6  85  88   7  97  22  72  52
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among agents. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" principle, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints and the need for an integer number of items per agent, a heuristic or algorithmic approach is often employed.

Let's work through an allocation step-by-step:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent values items differently.
   - We will initially consider each agent's highest valued items.

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 (93) the most.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 (99) the most.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 (97) the most.

3. **Assign Each Agent Their Highest Valued Item Initially:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 7.
   - Agent 2 gets item 5.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8.
   - We will allocate these based on maximizing each agent's total value while keeping the allocation envy-free.

5. **Continue Allocation:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value, 77).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value, 85).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value, 91).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value, 64).
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (next highest value, 83).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value, 6).

6. **Final Allocation Check:**
   - Each agent should have 3, 3, and 3 items respectively.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 8],
    "1": [7, 0, 6],
    "2": [5, 2, 1]
}
```

Each agent's allocation aims to maximize their total value derived from the items while ensuring no agent envies another.
