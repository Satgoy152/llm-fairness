Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  21  93  49  95  40  36  53  61
1   1  27  29  11  40  71  38  95  57
2  75  31   5  16  69  93  12   0  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we can use a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach, taking turns to give each agent the item they value most that hasn't been allocated yet. Given that there are only 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should receive exactly 3 items.

Let's look at the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (95)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (93)
   - Third highest: Item 0 (87)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 7 (95)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (71)
   - Third highest: Item 4 (40) [Already chosen by Agent 0]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (93)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (75)
   - Third highest: Item 4 (69) [Already chosen by Agent 0]

Now let's allocate the items step by step:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 picks Item 4 (95)
  - Agent 1 picks Item 7 (95)
  - Agent 2 picks Item 5 (93)

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 picks Item 2 (93)
  - Agent 1 picks Item 5 (71) [Already chosen by Agent 2, so next highest available is Item 8 (57)]
  - Agent 2 picks Item 0 (75)

- **Round 3 (Final Round):**
  - Agent 0 picks Item 0 (87) [Already chosen by Agent 2, so next highest available is Item 3 (49)]
  - Agent 1 picks Item 1 (27)
  - Agent 2 picks Item 6 (12)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 3],
    "1": [7, 8, 1],
    "2": [5, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent.
