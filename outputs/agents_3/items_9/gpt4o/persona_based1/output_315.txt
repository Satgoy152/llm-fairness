Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  73  36  60   9  19  75  45  37
1  21  91  53  19  30   1  58  17  25
2  58  66  90  24  93  35  41  32  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible according to the given valuations. A common approach is to use an iterative method to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that the overall distribution remains balanced.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent values items differently, and we need to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible.
   - We need to consider how we can balance the total valuations each agent receives.

2. **Assign Items**:
   - **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 58. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 91. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 90. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 60. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 93. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 19. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 75. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 45. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 37. Assign item 8 to Agent 0.

3. **Re-evaluate Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 has received too many items. We need to balance the number of items and total values assigned.

4. **Redistribute**:
   - Reassign some items to ensure each agent gets a fair share:
     - Move Item 6 (valued at 41 by Agent 2) from Agent 0 to Agent 2.
     - Move Item 5 (valued at 1 by Agent 1) from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - After redistribution, ensure each agent has items and the total number of items is 9.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers both the preferences of the agents and the need for each to receive a roughly equal share of the overall value.
