Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  77  50   2  76  60  78  38  31
1  25  18  46  98  44  42  31  49  67
2  85  13  21  33  64   7  23  29  70
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 77 50  2 76 60 78 38 31]
 [25 18 46 98 44 42 31 49 67]
 [85 13 21 33 64  7 23 29 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 77, 50, 2, 76, 60, 78, 38, 31]
- Agent 1's valuations: [25, 18, 46, 98, 44, 42, 31, 49, 67]
- Agent 2's valuations: [85, 13, 21, 33, 64, 7, 23, 29, 70]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Identify each agent's highest valued items and attempt to allocate those without causing envy.
2. Ensure each agent receives 3 items since there are 9 items in total.

#### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest values: Item 6 (78), Item 1 (77), Item 4 (76)
  - Allocate: [6, 1, 4]

- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 8 (67), Item 7 (49)
  - Allocate: [3, 8, 7]

- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest values: Item 0 (85), Item 4 (considered but already allocated to Agent 0), Item 8 (considered but already allocated to Agent 1), next highest available: Items 2 (21) and 5 (7)
  - Allocate: [0, 2, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing envy among the agents.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 4],
    "1": [3, 8, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences to a significant extent and ensures that each agent receives an equal number of items (3 each), with all 9 items allocated.
