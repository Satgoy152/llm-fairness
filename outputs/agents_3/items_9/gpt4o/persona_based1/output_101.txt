Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  84  11  94  50  89  54  44  77
1  52  23  24  16  86  43  21   5  57
2  45  83   9  57  29  93  41  47  11
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that attempts to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent values their allocation as much as possible compared to others.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0: Highest valuation items are 3 (94), 5 (89), 1 (84).
   - Agent 1: Highest valuation items are 4 (86), 0 (52), 8 (57).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuation items are 5 (93), 1 (83), 3 (57).

2. **Greedy Allocation by Highest Valuation**:
   - Allocate the highest value item to each agent, starting from the highest overall value and ensuring no overlap.

3. **Allocation Consideration**:
   - Agent 0:
     - Highest priority items: 3, 5, 1
   - Agent 1:
     - Highest priority items: 4, 0, 8
   - Agent 2:
     - Highest priority items: 5, 1, 3

4. **Item Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Allocate item 3 (94): Highest value for Agent 0.
     - Allocate item 0 (30): Second highest preference after considering conflicts.
   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Allocate item 4 (86): Highest value for Agent 1.
     - Allocate item 8 (57): Next highest preference without conflict.
   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Allocate item 5 (93): Highest value for Agent 2.
     - Allocate item 1 (83): Second highest preference.
   - Remaining items: 2, 6, 7

5. **Final Allocation of Remaining Items**:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (11): Least liked by others.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (21): Next best available without envy.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (47): Best among remaining for Agent 2.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [4, 8, 6],
    "2": [5, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by providing each agent with items they value highly, while also ensuring each agent receives an equal number of items.
