Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  53  58  88  59  39  49  48  45
1  19  92  71  52   0  41  61  55  74
2  85  69  39  53  36  56  41  18  94
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility while ensuring that envy is minimized. Given the small number of agents and items, we can try to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

To approach this problem, let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Each agent should receive exactly 3 items to ensure all items are distributed.
2. We attempt to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible.

After evaluating the valuations, we can assign items to maximize fairness and minimize envy as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5]
  - Valuation: 47 (for item 0) + 88 (for item 3) + 39 (for item 5) = 174

- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 8]
  - Valuation: 92 (for item 1) + 71 (for item 2) + 74 (for item 8) = 237

- Agent 2: Items [4, 6, 7]
  - Valuation: 36 (for item 4) + 41 (for item 6) + 18 (for item 7) = 95

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items, and the total number of items allocated is 9. The allocations attempt to balance the total perceived value among the agents as much as possible based on their individual valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2, 8],
    "2": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
