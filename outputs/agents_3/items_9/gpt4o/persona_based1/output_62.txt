Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  83   0  84   7  31  32   7  21
1  68   1  43  10  15  65  15  62  14
2  57  83   0  64  56  93  35  18  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their own valuation. In this problem, with 3 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 5, 7, and 2.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 5, 8, and 1.

Given these preferences, let's allocate the items to achieve a fair division:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6, 8

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items, and we try to respect their preferences as much as possible.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the values each agent receives, considering their preferences and ensuring each one gets a fair share of the items.
