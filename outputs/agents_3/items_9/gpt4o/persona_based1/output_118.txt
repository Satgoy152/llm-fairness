Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34   7  22   8  65  26  96  98  22
1  57  19  58  21   5  80  53  79  17
2  97  56  62  62  75  75  34  64  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a simple algorithm to approximate an envy-free allocation by considering each agent's preferences and attempting to equalize the total value received by each agent.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. The totals are:
   - Agent 0: 378
   - Agent 1: 389
   - Agent 2: 571

2. We aim to give each agent items in such a way that the total value each receives is as equal as possible, given the constraints.

Using a heuristic approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign items to maximize fairness in terms of total value received, taking turns among agents to pick the highest valued remaining item according to their preferences, and ensuring each agent ends up with three items (since there are 9 items and 3 agents).

Following this approach, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 6, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 34 + 96 + 22 = 152

- Agent 1: [5, 7, 3]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 80 + 79 + 21 = 180

- Agent 2: [1, 2, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 2: 56 + 62 + 75 = 193

These allocations are chosen to roughly balance the total valuations across the agents, though they may not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of the items and the differing valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 8],
    "1": [5, 7, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
