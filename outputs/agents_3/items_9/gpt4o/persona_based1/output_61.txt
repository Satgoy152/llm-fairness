Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  43  12  79  49  15  69  21  65
1  31  50  30  84  29  62  40  38  46
2  70   0  84  16   7  78  78  76   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 43 12 79 49 15 69 21 65]
 [31 50 30 84 29 62 40 38 46]
 [70  0 84 16  7 78 78 76  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation where each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations, and where possible, minimize envy. Since each agent values items differently, we will use these valuations to guide our allocation decisions.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  43  12  79  49  15  69  21  65
1  31  50  30  84  29  62  40  38  46
2  70   0  84  16   7  78  78  76   3
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 and 6 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 2, 5, and 6 highly.

2. **Distribute High-Value Items:**
   - Start by allocating items with the highest valuations to the respective agents, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Re-evaluate Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate remaining items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring no envy or minimizing it as much as possible.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Highest values are items 3, 6, and 0. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as a high priority item.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items such as 1 and 5, which are moderately valued.
- **Agent 2:** Allocate high-value items like 2, as well as 5 and 6 if available.

Following this strategy:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1, 4, 8]
- Agent 2 receives items: [2, 5, 7]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations such that each agent receives items that are valuable to them while distributing the total items evenly among the agents.
