Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97   6  76  59  10  17  31  94  81
1   4  98  13  21  68  90   6  81  95
2  91  37  90  37  13  91  55  78  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items to agents in a fair and envy-free manner, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent envies another. This generally means trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their preferences.

Looking at the valuation table, we aim to allocate items such that the perceived value for each agent is as equal as possible. First, let's assess the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 0 (97), 7 (94), 8 (81)
- Agent 1 highly values items: 1 (98), 8 (95), 5 (90)
- Agent 2 highly values items: 0 (91), 5 (91), 2 (90)

We'll attempt to allocate items based on these valuations to ensure fairness:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item for each agent while avoiding overlap:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (97)
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (98)
   - Agent 2 gets item 5 (91)

2. Next, allocate the remaining highest valued items, ensuring no overlap:
   - Agent 0 gets item 7 (94)
   - Agent 1 gets item 8 (95)
   - Agent 2 gets item 2 (90)

3. Allocate remaining items to balance the allocation:
   - Agent 0 gets item 6 (31)
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (68)
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (37)

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 8, 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 2, 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and the distribution is balanced in terms of perceived value.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 6],
    "1": [1, 8, 4],
    "2": [5, 2, 3]
}
```
