Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  20  66  86  45   0  77  11  72
1  52  97  79  12  31  15  46  85  58
2  92  18  94  93  98   1  70  50  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [30, 20, 66, 86, 45, 0, 77, 11, 72]
- Agent 1: [52, 97, 79, 12, 31, 15, 46, 85, 58]
- Agent 2: [92, 18, 94, 93, 98, 1, 70, 50, 34]

A possible fair allocation method is the "Round Robin" approach, where agents take turns picking the most valued item not yet allocated.

Let's begin the allocation:

1. **Round 1:**

   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 86).
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 97).
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 98).

2. **Round 2:**

   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 77).
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 85).
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 94).

3. **Round 3:**

   - Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 72).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 52).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 1).

Now, each agent has been allocated 3 items, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1, 7, 0],
    "2": [4, 2, 5]
}
```
