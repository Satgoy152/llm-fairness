Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  33  55  81   2  78  44  31  30
1  84  41  13  45   7  31  25  38  23
2  68   3  32  57  80  41  60  63  19
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Here, we'll try to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own. 

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 33 + 55 + 81 + 2 + 78 + 44 + 31 + 30 = 389
- Agent 1: 84 + 41 + 13 + 45 + 7 + 31 + 25 + 38 + 23 = 307
- Agent 2: 68 + 3 + 32 + 57 + 80 + 41 + 60 + 63 + 19 = 423

Next, we need to allocate the items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share of the total value they perceive. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Items allocated: 3, 5, 6
   - Total value: 81 + 78 + 44 = 203

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Items allocated: 0, 7, 8
   - Total value: 84 + 38 + 23 = 145

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Items allocated: 1, 2, 4
   - Total value: 3 + 32 + 80 = 115

This allocation ensures each agent gets a significant portion of their perceived value. It's important to note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible due to the disparity in valuations, but this distribution attempts to minimize envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a share that seems fair based on their valuations.
