Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  71  45  39  17  54  33  87  77
1  38  26  58  13  19  71   7  14  33
2  51  14  38  45  54  53  45   0   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure, or simply aim to maximize each agent's total valuation under certain fairness constraints. Given the valuations, I'll attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the situation and try to balance the allocations using a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 7, and 8.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
   - Agent 2 has relatively even valuations with a slight preference for items 4 and 5.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by giving each agent their most valued items if possible, and then balance the remaining items to maintain fairness and envy-freeness.

3. **Allocation Steps:**
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 87, highest for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 71, highest for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 54, high for Agent 2 and low for others).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 71, next highest for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 58, next highest for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 60, high for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 45, high for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 45, decent for Agent 2).
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value 77, next highest for Agent 0).

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 7, and 8 with high total valuations.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 5, including their highest valuation item.
- Agent 2 gets items 3, 4, and 6, balancing their valuations.

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences while keeping the number of items per agent as whole numbers.
