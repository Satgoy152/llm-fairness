Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  26  58  66  35  28  36  25  39
1  27  14  78   6  25  49  18  34  51
2   6  64  43  52  64   8  83  57   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy. One commonly used method in these scenarios is the Envy-Free Allocation, where the goal is to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 87 + 26 + 58 + 66 + 35 + 28 + 36 + 25 + 39 = 400
- Agent 1's total valuation: 27 + 14 + 78 + 6 + 25 + 49 + 18 + 34 + 51 = 302
- Agent 2's total valuation: 6 + 64 + 43 + 52 + 64 + 8 + 83 + 57 + 5 = 382

To make a fair division, we aim to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction while minimizing the potential envy towards the bundles of other agents. This can be achieved by considering the relative valuation each agent has for each item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (87), 3 (66)
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 3
  
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 2 (78), 5 (49)
   - Allocate: Items 2 and 5

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 6 (83), 1 (64), 4 (64), 7 (57), 8 (5)
   - Allocate: Items 6, 1, 4, 7, and 8

This allocation is designed to ensure that each agent receives their most valued items while also trying to balance the total values received by different agents to minimize envy. Now, let's represent the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a share of the items.
