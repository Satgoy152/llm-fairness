Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  85  94  52  72  26   4  72  65
1  69  36  77  83  55  24  14  32  42
2  88  29  49  69  20  70  57  63  88
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim for an allocation where each agent believes they have received the best possible set of items given their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Determine each agent's total valuation for all items.
   - Agent 0: 11 + 85 + 94 + 52 + 72 + 26 + 4 + 72 + 65 = 481
   - Agent 1: 69 + 36 + 77 + 83 + 55 + 24 + 14 + 32 + 42 = 432
   - Agent 2: 88 + 29 + 49 + 69 + 20 + 70 + 57 + 63 + 88 = 533

2. **Fair Division Strategy**: Use a strategy such as the Adjusted Winner Procedure or simply trial and error to allocate items in a way that balances the agents' valuations while respecting envy-freeness.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Assign items one by one to the agent who values the item the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with 3 items (since there are 9 items in total and 3 agents).

4. **Check and Adjust**: After an initial allocation, check for envy and adjust if necessary by swapping items to improve fairness.

Here's a possible allocation that can achieve the desired fairness:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4. (Valuation: 85 + 94 + 72 = 251)
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 3, and 8. (Valuation: 69 + 83 + 42 = 194)
- Agent 2 receives items 5, 6, and 7. (Valuation: 70 + 57 + 63 = 190)

This allocation gives each agent a comparable total valuation, minimizing envy and maximizing fairness within the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
