Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  84  71  79  40  93  79  91  12
1   2  43   0  29  87  71  95  52  15
2  13  50  57  71  27  17  95   9  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a manner that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible based on the given valuations. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum the values that each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall preferences.

2. **Proportional Fairness:** Each agent should receive a share of the total value proportional to their valuation share.

3. **Greedy Allocation:** Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences to minimize envy.

4. **Finalize Allocation:** Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with these steps.

**Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

- Agent 0: \(78 + 84 + 71 + 79 + 40 + 93 + 79 + 91 + 12 = 627\)
- Agent 1: \(2 + 43 + 0 + 29 + 87 + 71 + 95 + 52 + 15 = 394\)
- Agent 2: \(13 + 50 + 57 + 71 + 27 + 17 + 95 + 9 + 65 = 404\)

**Allocate Items:**

- **Agent 0's Preference:** Based on valuation, Agent 0 should ideally be allocated items that are highly valued by them: Items 5, 1, 7, 0, 3.
- **Agent 1's Preference:** Agent 1 highly values items 6, 4, 5.
- **Agent 2's Preference:** Agent 2 highly values items 6, 2, 3, 8.

**Allocation:**

Given the above preferences and valuations, a possible allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated is:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 7]
- Agent 1: [4, 6, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 8]

This allocation considers the high-value preferences of each agent while ensuring each agent receives 3 items.

**Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 5],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to respect each agent's preferences to the greatest extent possible.
