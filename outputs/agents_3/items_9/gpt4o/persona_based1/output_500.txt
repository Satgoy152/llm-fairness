Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  77  88  96   8  73  54  49  21
1  58  76  87  74   3  53  32  10  87
2  37  24  79  52  12  33  57  37   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 77 88 96  8 73 54 49 21]
 [58 76 87 74  3 53 32 10 87]
 [37 24 79 52 12 33 57 37  4]]
Output:
The goal is to allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is fair, and ideally envy-free. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will try to achieve a fair allocation.

To make a fair allocation, let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 61 + 77 + 88 + 96 + 8 + 73 + 54 + 49 + 21 = 527
- Agent 1: 58 + 76 + 87 + 74 + 3 + 53 + 32 + 10 + 87 = 480
- Agent 2: 37 + 24 + 79 + 52 + 12 + 33 + 57 + 37 + 4 = 335

Next, we will try to allocate items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. 

We'll use a greedy algorithm, assigning the highest-valued available item to each agent in turn.

1. **Agent 0**'s highest value is for item 3 (96).
2. **Agent 1**'s highest value is for item 2 (87).
3. **Agent 2**'s highest value is for item 6 (57).

Repeat this process while considering the remaining items:

4. **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 2 (88), but it's taken, so item 1 (77).
5. **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 8 (87).
6. **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 7 (37).

Continue until all items are allocated:

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 0 (61).
8. **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 3 (74).
9. **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 5 (33).

Finally, we assign the remaining item:

10. **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 5 (73) but it's taken, so item 4 (8).
11. **Agent 1**: No items left to assign.
12. **Agent 2**: No items left to assign.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 0, 4],
    "1": [2, 8, 3],
    "2": [6, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, balancing fairness across the agents. Note that this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, but it aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value significantly.
