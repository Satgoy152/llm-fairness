Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  44  81  37  49  19  55  87  58
1  29  54  87  21  96  24  41  62  16
2  52  63  30  94  77  53  17  67  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle, relative to their own valuations. This is a challenging problem, and achieving perfect envy-freeness is often not possible, but we can attempt to minimize envy.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items most highly: 81 (item 2), 87 (item 7)
- Agent 1 values items most highly: 87 (item 2), 96 (item 4)
- Agent 2 values items most highly: 94 (item 3), 77 (item 4)

Given these valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Assign item 2 (value 81) and item 7 (value 87), which are highly valued by Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Assign item 4 (value 96) and item 1 (value 54). Item 4 is the highest valued item for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Assign item 3 (value 94), item 6 (value 17), and item 8 (value 61). Item 3 is the highest valued item for Agent 2.

4. **Remaining Items** (0 and 5):
   - Item 0 (value 42 for Agent 0, 29 for Agent 1, 52 for Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2, who values it the highest among the remaining items.
   - Item 5 (value 19 for Agent 0, 24 for Agent 1, 53 for Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2, who values it the highest among the remaining items.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 3, 5, 6, 8]

These allocations attempt to balance the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 3, 5, 6, 8]
}
```
