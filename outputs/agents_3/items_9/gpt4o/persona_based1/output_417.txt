Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  36  18  47  40  81  69   2  34
1  62  53  48  25  42  35  11  87  25
2  75  78  47  40  32  99  22   2  48
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One common method to approach this is the adjusted winner procedure, but given the constraints of the problem (integer allocations and the need to allocate all items), we can use a simpler approach by considering each agent's valuations and attempting to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's start by examining the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 39 + 36 + 18 + 47 + 40 + 81 + 69 + 2 + 34 = 366
- Agent 1: 62 + 53 + 48 + 25 + 42 + 35 + 11 + 87 + 25 = 388
- Agent 2: 75 + 78 + 47 + 40 + 32 + 99 + 22 + 2 + 48 = 443

Now, we attempt to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible:

1. **Assign high-value items:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest total valuation, so we can start by assigning some of the highest valued items to Agent 2 to reduce potential envy:
     - Item 5 (99) and Item 1 (78) to Agent 2.

2. **Assign remaining high-value items:**
   - To Agent 0, assign Item 6 (69) and Item 3 (47).
   - To Agent 1, assign Item 7 (87).

3. **Distribute remaining items to balance valuations:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 (39) and 4 (40).
   - Agent 1 receives Item 2 (48).
   - Agent 2 receives Items 8 (48).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4, 6] with total value = 39 + 47 + 40 + 69 = 245
- Agent 1: Items [2, 7] with total value = 48 + 87 = 135
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5, 8] with total value = 78 + 99 + 48 = 225

This allocation is not exactly balanced in terms of total value, but it respects the integer allocation requirement and ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 5, 8]
}
```
