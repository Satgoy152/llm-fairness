Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  26  40  54  40   6  22  53   3
1  31  98  89  84  52  23  82  51  32
2  83  52  49  11  48   8  87  46  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given these valuations.

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "adjusted winner" procedure or a similar fair division algorithm. However, for simplicity, let's try a heuristic approach to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is roughly balanced.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Sum of valuations = 256
   - Agent 1: Sum of valuations = 542
   - Agent 2: Sum of valuations = 412

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign items to the agent who values them the most first, ensuring each agent gets three items since there are 9 items and 3 agents.

3. **Heuristic Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (83)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (98)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (89)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (84)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (40)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (6)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (87)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (53)
   - Item 8: Agent 2 (28)

This allocation tries to ensure each agent gets items that they value highly, distributing the items to balance total perceived value. Each agent receives three items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 3],
    "2": [0, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair by giving each agent items they value highly, thereby attempting to minimize envy.
