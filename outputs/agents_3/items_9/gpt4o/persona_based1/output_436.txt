Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  42  95  11  85  13  17  82  82
1  31  15  64  82  88  92  64  39   6
2  20  41   6  99  40   7  16  87  44
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division. This means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, we can start by calculating each agent’s total valuation for all items to help guide the allocation process:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 58 + 42 + 95 + 11 + 85 + 13 + 17 + 82 + 82 = 485
- Agent 1's total valuation: 31 + 15 + 64 + 82 + 88 + 92 + 64 + 39 + 6 = 481
- Agent 2's total valuation: 20 + 41 + 6 + 99 + 40 + 7 + 16 + 87 + 44 = 360

Next, we will assign items in a way that considers each agent’s preferences, aiming to balance their valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

1. **Assign high-value items**: Start with items with the highest valuation across all agents and assign them to the agent who values them most, provided it does not lead to significant envy.

2. **Balance the remaining items**: Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuations among the agents, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Based on the above strategy, here's one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2, 7] 
  - Valuations: 58 (Item 0) + 95 (Item 2) + 82 (Item 7) = 235

- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 4, 5, 6]
  - Valuations: 15 (Item 1) + 88 (Item 4) + 92 (Item 5) + 64 (Item 6) = 259

- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 8]
  - Valuations: 99 (Item 3) + 44 (Item 8) = 143

This allocation balances the agents' total valuations reasonably well, given the constraints. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [3, 8]
}
```
