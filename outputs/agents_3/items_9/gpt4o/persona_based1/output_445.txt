Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  48  40  75   0  22  10  85  81
1  13  37  11  23  37  26  45  92  91
2  86  65  45  63  17  31  60  90  23
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for envy-freeness, where each agent feels they received at least as much value as any other agent from their own perspective. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all scenarios, a balanced approach is to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to balance the allocations based on these values:

- Agent 0 values all items at: 62 + 48 + 40 + 75 + 0 + 22 + 10 + 85 + 81 = 423
- Agent 1 values all items at: 13 + 37 + 11 + 23 + 37 + 26 + 45 + 92 + 91 = 375
- Agent 2 values all items at: 86 + 65 + 45 + 63 + 17 + 31 + 60 + 90 + 23 = 480

We can see that Agent 2 has the highest total valuation, followed by Agent 0, and then Agent 1. Let's distribute the items in a way that tries to balance these valuations.

1. Start by allocating items that have the highest individual value for each agent.
2. Then, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

Based on this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 7 (Value: 75 + 85 = 160)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 8 (Value: 37 + 91 = 128)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 2, 5, 6 (Value: 86 + 65 + 45 + 31 + 60 = 287)

Checking the total number of items allocated:
- Agent 0 has 2 items
- Agent 1 has 2 items
- Agent 2 has 5 items

This allocation sums to a total of 9 items. Each agent gets a share of items based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the value each agent perceives they are getting, given their individual valuations of the items.
