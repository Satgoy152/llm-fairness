Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  80  55  75  79  34  83  51  22
1  22  50  59  69   4  24  30  91  11
2  95  29  48  34  11  90  71  12   6
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we want to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive relative to other agents. This may not always be perfectly achievable, but we aim to reduce envy as much as possible.

Given the valuations, let's analyze a reasonable allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, 3, 6, and 4. The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 7, which is significantly higher than their valuation of other items.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0, 5, and 6. The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 0, but since Agent 0 also values it highly, we may need to compromise.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Let's give them items 0, 1, and 6, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1**: Give them item 7, which they value the most, and item 3, which is the next highest value for them.
- **Agent 2**: Give them items 5, 2, 4, and 8. These items collectively provide a reasonable sum of valuations for Agent 2.

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of value among the agents while respecting their preferences as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [5, 2, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
