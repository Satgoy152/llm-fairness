Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  68   5  85  51  45  21  34  31
1  45  30  77  90  34  93  21  49  12
2   5  92   2  69  44  28  77  35  86
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division and attempt to achieve envy-freeness, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

We can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach for this allocation, which maximizes the product of utilities (valuations) for each agent. This method is known to often produce allocations that are both efficient and envy-free up to one item (EF1).

Let's consider the valuations and make an initial allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [79, 68, 5, 85, 51, 45, 21, 34, 31]
   - Highest valued items: 3, 0, 1

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [45, 30, 77, 90, 34, 93, 21, 49, 12]
   - Highest valued items: 5, 3, 2

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [5, 92, 2, 69, 44, 28, 77, 35, 86]
   - Highest valued items: 1, 8, 6

We will allocate items based on these preferences, ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 5]
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives items they highly value. Let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
