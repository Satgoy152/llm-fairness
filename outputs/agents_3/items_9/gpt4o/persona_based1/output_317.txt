Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  23  13   9  39  70  36  24  40
1  32   4  86  16  41  66  75  24  79
2  57  30  52  38  99  96  31  89  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.

    - Agent 0: \(25 + 23 + 13 + 9 + 39 + 70 + 36 + 24 + 40 = 279\)
    - Agent 1: \(32 + 4 + 86 + 16 + 41 + 66 + 75 + 24 + 79 = 423\)
    - Agent 2: \(57 + 30 + 52 + 38 + 99 + 96 + 31 + 89 + 34 = 526\)

2. **Calculate Fair Share:** The fair share of total value each agent should receive is ideally proportional to the total valuation:
   - Total valuation of all items combined: \(279 + 423 + 526 = 1228\).
   - Fair share per agent: \( \frac{1228}{3} \approx 409.33\).

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy:** Distribute items to agents attempting to match or exceed their fair share, while ensuring no agent envies another.

4. **Allocation:**
   - Assign items to agents by considering their highest valued items first, ensuring that each agent receives items in such a way that the total value they derive from their allocation is as close to their fair share as possible without causing envy.

Using this method, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (99) and item 5 (96), which sum up to 195. They also value item 7 highly (89), so allocate items 4, 5, and 7 to Agent 2. This totals \(99 + 96 + 89 = 284\). To further match their fair share, we can add item 2 (52). Total now: \(284 + 52 = 336\).

- **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (86), and items 6 (75) and 8 (79). Allocating these items provides a total value of \(86 + 75 + 79 = 240\). We can additionally allocate item 5 (66) to them to increase their valuation, totaling \(240 + 66 = 306\).

- **Agent 0** will receive the remaining items. They value item 5 (70) highly, and can have items 0 (25), 1 (23), and 8 (40), for a total of \(70 + 25 + 23 + 40 = 158\).

After adjustment to ensure all items are allocated, here is a feasible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, and the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible with integer assignments.
