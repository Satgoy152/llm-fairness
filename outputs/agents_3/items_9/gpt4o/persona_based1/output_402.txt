Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  76  58  22  71  29  16  46   3
1  58  35  74  38  48  95  85   4  35
2  75   4  69  48  42  14  90  43  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[54 76 58 22 71 29 16 46  3]
 [58 35 74 38 48 95 85  4 35]
 [75  4 69 48 42 14 90 43 78]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle, we can employ an algorithm based on maximizing each agent's valuation for their assigned items while ensuring all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [54, 76, 58, 22, 71, 29, 16, 46, 3]
Agent 1: [58, 35, 74, 38, 48, 95, 85, 4, 35]
Agent 2: [75, 4, 69, 48, 42, 14, 90, 43, 78]
```

Let's distribute the items while considering the preferences of each agent:

1. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most among those who have not yet been assigned that item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 7, 8

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their valuation.

Now, present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the condition that all items are allocated, and it aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
