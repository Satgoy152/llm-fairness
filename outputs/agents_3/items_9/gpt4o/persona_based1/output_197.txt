Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  55  86   6  83   2  13  24  17
1  55  69  40  57  16  24  18  55  48
2  11  98  62  26  22   2   5  71  72
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we should strive to ensure that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their own valuations. We will use the following approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the valuations for each item from the perspective of each agent.
2. **Proportional Fair Share**: Calculate a proportional fair share for each agent based on their total valuation.
3. **Allocate Items**: Allocate items to agents such that the total value of items each agent receives is as close as possible to their proportional fair share, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and proceed with allocations:

- **Agent 0's Total Value**: 46 + 55 + 86 + 6 + 83 + 2 + 13 + 24 + 17 = 332
- **Agent 1's Total Value**: 55 + 69 + 40 + 57 + 16 + 24 + 18 + 55 + 48 = 382
- **Agent 2's Total Value**: 11 + 98 + 62 + 26 + 22 + 2 + 5 + 71 + 72 = 369

The total valuation across all items for all agents is 1083.

**Proportional Fair Share (PFS):**

- For Agent 0: \( \frac{332}{1083} \times 9 \approx 2.76 \)
- For Agent 1: \( \frac{382}{1083} \times 9 \approx 3.17 \)
- For Agent 2: \( \frac{369}{1083} \times 9 \approx 3.06 \)

This suggests an allocation close to 3 items for each agent, with attention to their specific valuations.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Sort items by each agent's valuation, aiming for high-value items per agent.
2. Allocate items iteratively to each agent by alternating choices, starting with the agent with the highest PFS.

Using this strategy, the allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4, 8] (total value: 46 + 83 + 17 = 146)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3, 7] (total value: 69 + 57 + 55 = 181)
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5, 6] (total value: 62 + 2 + 5 = 69)

**Final Allocation in JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the valuations and attempts to maintain fairness while ensuring each item is allocated.
