Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   6  87  41  95  62  13  95  96
1  35  49  30  10  68  52  85  61  19
2  83  85  51  65  41  98  15  18  93
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an allocation method that takes into account the valuations each agent has for the items. One such method is the "envy-free allocation" approach, where we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 74, 6, 87, 41, 95, 62, 13, 95, 96
- Agent 1: 35, 49, 30, 10, 68, 52, 85, 61, 19
- Agent 2: 83, 85, 51, 65, 41, 98, 15, 18, 93

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were to take each item.
2. Distribute the items in such a way that no agent would prefer to have the items allocated to another agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 4, 7, and 8 the most.
- Agent 1 values items 6 and 1 the most.
- Agent 2 values items 5, 0, and 2 the most.

Based on these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2, 3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and reduces the chances of envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
