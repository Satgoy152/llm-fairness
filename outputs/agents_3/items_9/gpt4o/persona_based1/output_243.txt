Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  51  85  50   6  87  35  82   6
1  41  82  50  38  35  88  87  90  17
2  78  80  52  34  23   5  69  99  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent prefers or is not envious of their bundle compared to the bundles of other agents based on their own valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we will aim to approximate it as closely as possible.

First, let's evaluate the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 34 + 51 + 85 + 50 + 6 + 87 + 35 + 82 + 6 = 436
- Agent 1's total valuation: 41 + 82 + 50 + 38 + 35 + 88 + 87 + 90 + 17 = 528
- Agent 2's total valuation: 78 + 80 + 52 + 34 + 23 + 5 + 69 + 99 + 56 = 496

Next, we'll attempt to allocate the items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is roughly proportional to their total valuation, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

After evaluating different allocation possibilities, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3, 5] 
  - Valuation: 51 (Item 1) + 50 (Item 3) + 87 (Item 5) = 188

- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2, 4, 8]
  - Valuation: 41 (Item 0) + 50 (Item 2) + 35 (Item 4) + 17 (Item 8) = 143

- **Agent 2**: Items [6, 7]
  - Valuation: 69 (Item 6) + 99 (Item 7) = 168

This allocation tries to balance the envy by giving each agent a fair portion of their total valuation potential, while also respecting the integer constraint on item allocation. Now, present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 8],
    "2": [6, 7]
}
```
