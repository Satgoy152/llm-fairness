Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  96  91  57  63  20   8  69  88
1  47   8  75  32  87  53  96  85  54
2  62  96  20  95  31  87  50  89  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an algorithm that aims for envy-freeness and equitable distribution. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we can aim for a solution that minimizes envy and provides a balanced distribution.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent must receive 3 items because there are 9 items and 3 agents.
   - We will try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations.
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that we do not exceed the total number of items.
   - Adjust the allocations to balance total valuations, ensuring each agent receives exactly 3 items.

3. **Detailed Allocation**:

   - **Agent 0**: 
     - Prefers items with valuations: [96, 91, 88]
     - Allocate items: 1, 2, 8

   - **Agent 1**: 
     - Prefers items with valuations: [96, 96, 87]
     - Allocate items: 0, 4, 6

   - **Agent 2**: 
     - Prefers items with valuations: [96, 95, 89]
     - Allocate items: 3, 5, 7

This allocation gives each agent 3 items and aims to balance their total valuations.

The final allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 8],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```
