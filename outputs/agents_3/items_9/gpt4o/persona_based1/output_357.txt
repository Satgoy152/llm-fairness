Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  65  76  60  79  27  82  76  69
1  55  11  54  95   7  32  42  44   3
2  24  41  92  24  47   3  43  59  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to maximize the minimum valuation across all agents, ensuring each agent gets a reasonably valued allocation.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items** are: 6 (82), 4 (79), 2 (76), 7 (76), 8 (69).
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items** are: 3 (95), 0 (55), 2 (54), 6 (42), 7 (44).
3. **Agent 2's highest valued items** are: 2 (92), 8 (75), 7 (59), 4 (47), 1 (41).

A feasible strategy is to first allocate each agent their highest valued items, ensuring that every item is allocated only once. Since items 2, 6, 7, and 8 are highly valued by multiple agents, decisions need to be made to balance the allocations.

After analyzing the valuations and trying to balance across agents, the following allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 5, 7, 8]

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5, 7, 8]
}
```
