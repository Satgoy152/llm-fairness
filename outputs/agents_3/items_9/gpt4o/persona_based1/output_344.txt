Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  54  88  17  73  53  26  70  61
1  72  93  35  79  80  97   1  95  64
2  68  71  50  96   7  93  18  82  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent is satisfied relative to their own valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking the item they value the most among the remaining unallocated items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. **Initialization**: List the items and their respective values for each agent.

2. **Round-Robin Selection**: Each agent will select their most valued item from the remaining pool in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Round 1**:
     - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 88).
     - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 97).
     - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 96).

   - **Round 2**:
     - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 85).
     - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 93).
     - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 82).

   - **Round 3**:
     - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 73).
     - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value 64).
     - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 18).

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 4],
    "1": [5, 1, 8],
    "2": [3, 7, 6]
}
```
