Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  76  28  38  70  65  81  62  64
1  26  14  36  91  39  63  22   7  17
2  98  58  19   1  55  31  75   4  65
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 76 28 38 70 65 81 62 64]

 [98 58 19  1 55 31 75  4 65]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent is satisfied with their bundle based on their individual valuations. Here’s one way to approach this problem:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall valuation perspective.
2. Use these valuations to guide allocation, trying to balance the perceived value each agent receives.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with these steps:

### Agent Total Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 71 + 76 + 28 + 38 + 70 + 65 + 81 + 62 + 64 = 555
- **Agent 1:** 26 + 14 + 36 + 91 + 39 + 63 + 22 + 7 + 17 = 315
- **Agent 2:** 98 + 58 + 19 + 1 + 55 + 31 + 75 + 4 + 65 = 406

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0** values item 6 the most (81) and item 1 second most (76).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (91) and item 5 second most (63).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (98) and item 6 second most (75).

By prioritizing each agent's high-value items and balancing the total number of items, we can achieve a fair allocation. Here’s a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 6, 7]
  - Values: 76, 81, 62
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 4, 5]
  - Values: 91, 39, 63
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 2, 8]
  - Values: 98, 19, 65

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their preferences, and every item is distributed, satisfying the condition of integer allocations.
