Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  10  80  40  75  62  25  86  18
1  62  90  39  14  27  84  24  61  76
2  94  52  28  53  89  82   5  96  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 10 80 40 75 62 25 86 18]
 [62 90 39 14 27 84 24 61 76]
 [94 52 28 53 89 82  5 96 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach aims to maximize the product of the utilities for each agent, which is a common method to achieve fairness in allocation problems.

Considering the valuations given in the table, we try to allocate the items such that the allocations are as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows: [42, 10, 80, 40, 75, 62, 25, 86, 18]
2. **Agent 1** values items as follows: [62, 90, 39, 14, 27, 84, 24, 61, 76]
3. **Agent 2** values items as follows: [94, 52, 28, 53, 89, 82, 5, 96, 29]

Let's allocate the items by maximizing fairness:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 5, 8
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 3, 7

These allocations attempt to balance the valuations among agents, minimizing envy and maximizing fairness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 8],
    "2": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
