Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  17   6  62  28  39  87  41  34
1  84  36   1  46  56  59  88  42  72
2   4  49  58   5  39  65  75  30   1
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to achieve this is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of utilities. However, given the small number of items and agents, we can also try to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here are the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 3 + 17 + 6 + 62 + 28 + 39 + 87 + 41 + 34 = 317
- Agent 1: 84 + 36 + 1 + 46 + 56 + 59 + 88 + 42 + 72 = 484
- Agent 2: 4 + 49 + 58 + 5 + 39 + 65 + 75 + 30 + 1 = 326

Aiming to balance the total value, we can try the following allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent to balance the total value received.
2. Ensure each agent gets a roughly equal share of their total value.

Let's attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 3] with values 3, 6, 62 (Total = 71)
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5] with values 36, 56, 59 (Total = 151)
- Agent 2: [6, 7, 8] with values 75, 30, 1 (Total = 106)

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it ensures each agent receives items and tries to balance the total valuation. Adjustments can be made based on specific fairness criteria.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7, 8]
}
```
