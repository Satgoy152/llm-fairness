Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  87  67  31  37  53  21  18  52
1  99  55  44  94  38   2  87  54  64
2  43  91  24  69  67  43  53  43  41
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we aim to allocate the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their share.

Let's consider the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Items: 0 (26), 1 (87), 2 (67), 3 (31), 4 (37), 5 (53), 6 (21), 7 (18), 8 (52)

Agent 1:
- Items: 0 (99), 1 (55), 2 (44), 3 (94), 4 (38), 5 (2), 6 (87), 7 (54), 8 (64)

Agent 2:
- Items: 0 (43), 1 (91), 2 (24), 3 (69), 4 (67), 5 (43), 6 (53), 7 (43), 8 (41)

We will aim to allocate items to agents such that each agent receives approximately equal total valuation, and no agent envies another's allocation. 

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (99) and item 3 (94). Allocate these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (87) and item 2 (67). Allocate these items to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (67). Allocate this item to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 8 (64) to Agent 1, as it has the second-highest valuation for it after item 0.
5. Allocate item 5 (53) to Agent 0, as it has a reasonable valuation for it, and Agent 0 still needs more items.
6. Allocate item 6 (53) to Agent 2, as it has a reasonable valuation for it.
7. Allocate item 7 (54) to Agent 1 to balance the total number of items.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items with high personal valuations: 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1 receives items with high personal valuations and balances: 0, 3, 8, 7
- Agent 2 receives items with reasonable valuations: 4, 6

Here's the fair allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 8, 7],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and aims to minimize envy by focusing on their highest valued items.
