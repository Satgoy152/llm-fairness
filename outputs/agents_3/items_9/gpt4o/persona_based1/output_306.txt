Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  22  39  59  26  27  68  88  53
1  31  89  67  12  18  66  46  76  81
2  10  31  91  19  50  64  29  60  28
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. This can be a complex problem, especially with integer constraints and a small number of agents and items.

One common approach to achieving an envy-free allocation where possible is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, with a small number of items and agents, we can attempt a simple iterative approach to approximate a fair division.

Here's one allocation that attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Total value: 385
- Agent 1 values:
  - Total value: 490
- Agent 2 values:
  - Total value: 382

To achieve a fair allocation, we can aim to distribute items so that the perceived total value for each agent is approximately equal.

After reviewing the valuations, here's an allocation that balances the values:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 5, 8]
- Agent 2 gets items [2, 4, 7]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items with values: 3, 59, 68 (total = 130)
- Agent 1 receives items with values: 89, 66, 81 (total = 236)
- Agent 2 receives items with values: 91, 50, 60 (total = 201)

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to distribute the valued items among agents as fairly as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
