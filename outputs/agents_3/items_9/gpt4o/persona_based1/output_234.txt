Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  67  14  96  40  12  65  88  51
1  75  32  89  84  96  72  85   0   9
2  14  30   5  41  30  43  77  29  89
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of items among the three agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent values their share at least as much as the shares of the other agents. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We'll try to allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: We'll do the same for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate items that Agent 2 values more, considering the remaining items.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt a fair division:

- **Agent 0's Highest Valuations**: Item 3 (96), Item 7 (88), Item 1 (67)
- **Agent 1's Highest Valuations**: Item 4 (96), Item 2 (89), Item 6 (85)
- **Agent 2's Highest Valuations**: Item 8 (89), Item 6 (77), Item 5 (43)

Given the above, we can start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent based on preference, ensuring no overlaps:

1. **Allocate to Agent 0**:
   - Item 3 (96)
   - Item 7 (88)

2. **Allocate to Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 (96)
   - Item 2 (89)
   - Item 6 (85)

3. **Allocate to Agent 2**:
   - Item 8 (89)
   - Item 5 (43)

Now, we have remaining items: 0 and 1. These need to be allocated to ensure all items are distributed.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation for Agent 2 after previously allocated items)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation for Agent 0 after previously allocated items)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly without envy (as much as possible given the constraints) and all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 1],
    "1": [4, 2, 6],
    "2": [8, 5, 0]
}
```
