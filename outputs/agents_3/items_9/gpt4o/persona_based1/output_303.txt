Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  81  56  43  91  77  87  23  25
1  56  28   6  86  53  41  50  98  38
2  68  16  88  40   7  75  46  11  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent has an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

We'll proceed step by step to allocate the items optimally based on the given valuations:

1. **Identify the items with the highest value for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 91), Item 6 (value 87), Item 1 (value 81)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (value 98), Item 3 (value 86), Item 0 (value 56) 
   - Agent 2: Item 8 (value 99), Item 2 (value 88), Item 5 (value 75)

2. **Allocate these high-value items to each agent first**:
   - Assign Item 4, 6, 1 to Agent 0
   - Assign Item 7, 3, 0 to Agent 1
   - Assign Item 8, 2, 5 to Agent 2

3. **Check for any remaining conflicts**:
   - Agent 0 gets items [4, 6, 1] with values [91, 87, 81]
   - Agent 1 gets items [7, 3, 0] with values [98, 86, 56]
   - Agent 2 gets items [8, 2, 5] with values [99, 88, 75]

4. **Verify allocations**: 
   - Total items allocated: 9
   - Each agent receives exactly 3 items

The allocations are such that each agent gets their highest valued items, which helps in achieving a state that minimizes envy.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 1],
    "1": [7, 3, 0],
    "2": [8, 2, 5]
}
```
