Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  11   8  64  39  42  33  77  18
1  75  72  39  97  63  94  25   9  31
2  73  69   7  51  69  93   3  67  42
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use a method that aims for an allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly. One approach is to use an algorithm that ensures the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. A common heuristic is to use a round-robin or maximin approach, where agents take turns picking their most preferred item from the remaining items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0: 84 + 11 + 8 + 64 + 39 + 42 + 33 + 77 + 18 = 376
   - Agent 1: 75 + 72 + 39 + 97 + 63 + 94 + 25 + 9 + 31 = 505
   - Agent 2: 73 + 69 + 7 + 51 + 69 + 93 + 3 + 67 + 42 = 474

2. **Allocate items using a maximin approach:**
   - Start by assigning the item with the highest valuation for each agent.
   - Continue to assign the next highest item that hasn't been allocated yet.

The allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 84), item 7 (value 77), item 3 (value 64).
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 94), item 3 (value 97), item 1 (value 72).
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 93), item 4 (value 69), item 1 (value 69).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 6],
    "1": [3, 5, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 2]
}
```

Each item is allocated to ensure that the total number of items allocated is 9. This allocation attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets high-value items according to their preferences.
