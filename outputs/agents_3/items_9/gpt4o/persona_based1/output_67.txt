Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  74   3  42  49  77  78  68  77
1   6  66  26  60  93  78  67  36  51
2  54  15   0  13  92  85  26  86  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to minimize envy among agents. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. However, in practice, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging, especially with a limited number of items. We will attempt to create a balanced allocation that considers the agents' valuations as closely as possible.

Here are the steps we will follow to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Use a greedy approach to allocate items one by one, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most among the remaining items.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Calculate total valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 99 + 74 + 3 + 42 + 49 + 77 + 78 + 68 + 77 = 567
   - Agent 1: 6 + 66 + 26 + 60 + 93 + 78 + 67 + 36 + 51 = 483
   - Agent 2: 54 + 15 + 0 + 13 + 92 + 85 + 26 + 86 + 12 = 383

2. Allocate items based on highest valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 26.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 60.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 78.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
   - Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most at 77.

3. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 6, 8]
   - Agent 1: [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [5, 7]

Each agent has received a fair share based on their preferences, with Agent 0 receiving four items, Agent 1 receiving three items, and Agent 2 receiving two items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7]
}
```
