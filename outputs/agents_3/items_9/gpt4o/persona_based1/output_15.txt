Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  22  14  16  90  65  65  83  37
1  10   1  12  51  29  40  75  88  74
2   2  59  60  97  42  81  87  29  56
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. Given the constraints that each agent must get an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, one approach is to use a method inspired by the "Adjusted Winner" procedure, where items are allocated to maximize individual satisfaction while keeping envy minimal.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Start by looking at which items each agent values highly and try to allocate those items to them first.

2. **Balanced Allocation**: Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of total value based on their preferences. This might mean some agents get fewer items if those items are highly valued by them.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust initial allocations to minimize envy, which means ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's see how we can allocate these items:

- Agent 0 has very high value for item 4 (90), item 7 (83), and item 0 (51).
- Agent 1 highly values item 7 (88), item 6 (75), and item 8 (74).
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (97), item 6 (87), and item 5 (81).

Considering these high-value preferences, a fair allocation might look like:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 8]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2, 3, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they highly value, and the total number of items allocated sums to 9.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
