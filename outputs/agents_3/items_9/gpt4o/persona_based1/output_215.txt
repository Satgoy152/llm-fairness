Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  13   2  80  19  78  81  69  31
1  36  21  78  68  86  84  11  15   9
2   5  18  70  43  71  71  86  96   4
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each allocation is as equitable as possible based on the agents' valuations. A common approach is to use an algorithm such as the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms, but let's simplify the process due to the limited number of agents and items.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(65 + 13 + 2 + 80 + 19 + 78 + 81 + 69 + 31 = 438\)
- Agent 1: \(36 + 21 + 78 + 68 + 86 + 84 + 11 + 15 + 9 = 408\)
- Agent 2: \(5 + 18 + 70 + 43 + 71 + 71 + 86 + 96 + 4 = 464\)

Now, let's allocate the items by considering who values each item the most. This can help minimize envy:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 65.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 13.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 78.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most at 31.

Let's assign the items based on the highest valuation by each agent:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 6 and 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, which should minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 8],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7]
}
```
