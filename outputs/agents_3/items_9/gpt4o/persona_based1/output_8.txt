Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  37  25  12  91  91  13  74  75
1  95  16  14  13  96  84  40  31  64
2  91  46  78  46  61  30  11  33  80
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

One potential method to achieve this is to use a round-robin allocation, where each agent picks their most valued remaining item in turn. However, since we want to ensure fairness, we might adjust for any significant imbalances in satisfaction. Let's proceed with this approach.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 1:** Has the highest valuation of 95 for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 91 for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 91 for item 0, but it's already taken. Next highest unallocated is 91 for item 8. Assign item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 91 for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 1:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 96 for item 4, but it's taken. Next is 84 for item 5, but it's also taken. Next is 64 for item 8, but it's taken. Next is 40 for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 80 for item 8, but it's taken. Next is 78 for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 75 for item 8, but it's taken. Next is 74 for item 7. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 31 for item 7, but it's taken. Next is 16 for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
9. **Agent 2:** Next highest unallocated valuation is 46 for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences, aiming to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
