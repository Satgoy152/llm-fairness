Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  51  46  21  64  42  70  98  61
1   9  79   8  18  52  18  62  70  20
2  12  42  50  10   5   0  58  47  35
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their preferences. Here, I'll aim for a division where each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their own valuation of the items.

Given the valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Prioritize assigning items that have the highest valuation difference between agents to the agent valuing it highest, as this reduces potential envy.
2. Ensure each agent gets approximately an equal number of items or as close as possible given the constraints.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 0, 8]

Let's verify:
- Agent 0 gets items valued at 98, 64, and 70, which are high according to their valuations.
- Agent 1 gets the item with the highest value (79) and a couple more items that they value reasonably.
- Agent 2 gets items that are not as highly valued by others and are somewhat balanced with their own valuations.

This distribution spreads out the highest-valued items and attempts to balance the distribution, considering each agent's highest preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5, 3],
    "2": [2, 0, 8]
}
```
