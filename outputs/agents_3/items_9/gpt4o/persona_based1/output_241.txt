Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12   7  32  86  87  99  30  71   8
1  59  55   3   7  76  19  14  67  69
2  90  63  82  71  89  90  71  35  90
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the three agents, we need to ensure that each agent perceives the allocation as envy-free or as fair as possible given their valuations. One approach to solve this is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum perceived value.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
   - Agent 0: \(12 + 7 + 32 + 86 + 87 + 99 + 30 + 71 + 8 = 432\)
   - Agent 1: \(59 + 55 + 3 + 7 + 76 + 19 + 14 + 67 + 69 = 369\)
   - Agent 2: \(90 + 63 + 82 + 71 + 89 + 90 + 71 + 35 + 90 = 681\)

2. **Allocation Strategy**: We aim to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation of their bundle is as close as possible to an equal share of the total valuation, which is \((432 + 369 + 681) / 3 = 494\).

3. **Greedy Allocation with Rotations**: Start by allocating items to each agent based on their highest valuation and rotate to ensure fairness.

- **Initial Allocation**:
  - Allocate highest valued items to each agent in a round-robin fashion to ensure envy-freeness.

4. **Refinement**: Make adjustments to minimize envy and balance the total valuation for each agent.

Based on the valuations and the strategy outlined:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 2, 5, 8]

This allocation is done to balance perceived values as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value among the agents, considering their distinct valuations.
