Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  36  94  76  83  78  46  38  25
1   6   7  49  68  49  55  98  74  80
2  28  96  53  16   8  40  56  38  18
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations. We'll attempt to achieve this by ensuring that each agent receives items with relatively high personal value and by balancing the overall value across agents. Here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high values for items 2, 4, and 5.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 very highly and has decent values for items 3 and 8.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the most and has moderate values for items 0 and 7.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0** gets items [2, 4, 5] for a total value of 255 (94+83+78).
- **Agent 1** gets items [3, 6, 8] for a total value of 246 (68+98+80).
- **Agent 2** gets items [0, 1, 7] for a total value of 162 (28+96+38).

This allocation attempts to keep the total value each agent receives relatively balanced, considering their individual valuations. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their individual preferences.
