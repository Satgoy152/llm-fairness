Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  28  35  31  26  77  61  36  22
1  82  51  49  56  94  99  85  59  33
2  62  59   9  49  17  63  79  70  54
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that considers the preferences of each agent while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a procedure like the adjusted winner procedure or other approximation methods suitable for small numbers of items and agents. Given the valuation matrix, a reasonable approach is to allocate items by maximizing the sum of valuations each agent receives, while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how we can allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Start by identifying items that have significantly higher value for a particular agent compared to others. These items should be allocated to the agent who values them the most.

2. **Balanced Allocation:** Ensure each agent receives a roughly equal number of items or as fair a distribution as possible, given the constraint of integer allocations.

3. **Envy-Free Check:** After an initial allocation, check if any agent would prefer another agent's bundle. Adjust allocations as needed to minimize envy.

Given the above approach, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Receives items [0, 2, 7]
- **Agent 1:** Receives items [3, 4, 5]
- **Agent 2:** Receives items [1, 6, 8]

This allocation considers both the individual valuations and roughly balances the number of items allocated to each agent.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 6, 8]
}
```
