Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  66  15  48  85  92  16  77  77
1  55  38  96  16  16  12  55  57  99
2  83  52  19  89  55  89  53  37  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[30 66 15 48 85 92 16 77 77]
 [55 38 96 16 16 12 55 57 99]
 [83 52 19 89 55 89 53 37 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for an allocation that ensures envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0: [30, 66, 15, 48, 85, 92, 16, 77, 77]
- Agent 1: [55, 38, 96, 16, 16, 12, 55, 57, 99]
- Agent 2: [83, 52, 19, 89, 55, 89, 53, 37, 62]

We can aim to allocate the items in a way that each agent ends up with a comparable total valuation. Here is one possible allocation that attempts to balance the perceived values:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items that Agent 0 values highly and others value less, such as items 4, 5, and 7:
   - Items: 4 (85), 5 (92), 7 (77)
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 85 + 92 + 77 = 254

2. **Agent 1**: We can allocate items 2, 6, and 8 to Agent 1:
   - Items: 2 (96), 6 (55), 8 (99)
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 96 + 55 + 99 = 250

3. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 2:
   - Items: 0 (83), 1 (52), 3 (89)
   - Total valuation for Agent 2: 83 + 52 + 89 = 224

This allocation ensures each agent has a similar total valuation, reducing envy potential. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
