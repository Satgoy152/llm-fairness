Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  62  91  55  90  14  26  44  54
1  32  66  63  15  45  58  81  71  17
2  90  77  97  26   4   6  39  10  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuations. This is often challenging, but we can try to achieve a solution that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let’s examine the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0’s Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 2: 91
   - Item 4: 90
   - Item 0: 63

2. **Agent 1’s Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 6: 81
   - Item 7: 71
   - Item 1: 66

3. **Agent 2’s Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 2: 97
   - Item 0: 90
   - Item 8: 71

Given these preferences, we will try to find a distribution that maximizes the value for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items where Agent 0 has high valuation but others don't value them as much. Let's give:
  - Item 4 (90)
  - Item 1 (62)
  - Item 7 (44)

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items where Agent 1 has high valuation but others don't value them as much. Let's give:
  - Item 6 (81)
  - Item 3 (15)
  - Item 8 (17)

- **Agent 2**: Allocate items where Agent 2 has high valuation but others don't value them as much. Let's give:
  - Item 2 (97)
  - Item 0 (90)
  - Item 5 (6)

**Check:**
- Agent 0's total valuation: 90 (Item 4) + 62 (Item 1) + 44 (Item 7) = 196
- Agent 1's total valuation: 81 (Item 6) + 15 (Item 3) + 17 (Item 8) = 113
- Agent 2's total valuation: 97 (Item 2) + 90 (Item 0) + 6 (Item 5) = 193

Now we have allocated all 9 items, ensuring each agent gets some items, and the allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences to the extent possible.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 7],
    "1": [6, 3, 8],
    "2": [2, 0, 5]
}
```
