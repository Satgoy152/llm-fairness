Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  98  12  13  50  76  36  61  35
1  78  74  76  41  96  33  84  76  75
2  97  96   1  87  26  88  55  31  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To determine a fair allocation of the items among the agents, I will aim for an envy-free distribution. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, given their own valuations.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 | Item 8 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 29     | 98     | 12     | 13     | 50     | 76     | 36     | 61     | 35     |
| 1     | 78     | 74     | 76     | 41     | 96     | 33     | 84     | 76     | 75     |
| 2     | 97     | 96     | 1      | 87     | 26     | 88     | 55     | 31     | 51     |

A possible approach to achieve a fair distribution is to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent's allocated items while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 1.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most and also item 5.

Let's allocate the items based on these high valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

- Start by giving each agent their most valued item:

  - Agent 0: Item 1 (98)
  - Agent 1: Item 4 (96)
  - Agent 2: Item 0 (97)

- Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations and aiming for an envy-free distribution:

  - Agent 0:
    - Items: 1, 5 (98, 76)
    - Total value: 174

  - Agent 1:
    - Items: 4, 6, 7 (96, 84, 76)
    - Total value: 256

  - Agent 2:
    - Items: 0, 3, 8 (97, 87, 51)
    - Total value: 235

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that sum up to a considerable valuation, and no agent would envy another's allocation under these circumstances. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 8]
}
```
