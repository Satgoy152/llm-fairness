Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  65  75  80   5  43  65  10  85
1  41  52  10  21  14   9  33  50  64
2  64  38  71  58  61  94  44  67  99
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division according to the criteria of envy-freeness and ensuring all items are allocated, let's approach this problem using the Maximum Weighted Matching or Envy-Free Matching method.

We want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations of the items. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [63, 65, 75, 80, 5, 43, 65, 10, 85]
- Agent 1: [41, 52, 10, 21, 14, 9, 33, 50, 64]
- Agent 2: [64, 38, 71, 58, 61, 94, 44, 67, 99]

The items will be allocated so that the total perceived value for each agent is balanced as closely as possible.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 0: Item 8 (85), Item 3 (80), Item 2 (75)
   - Allocation: Items [8, 3, 5]
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 1: Item 8 (64), Item 7 (50), Item 1 (52)
   - Allocation: Items [1, 7, 4]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items for Agent 2: Item 8 (99), Item 5 (94), Item 0 (64)
   - Allocation: Items [0, 2, 6]

Now, we'll ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives an item they value less than others in their allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2, 6]

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent and aims to balance the perceived value among agents.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 6]
}
```
