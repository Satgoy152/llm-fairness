Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  73  71  69  94  64  59  61  78
1  54  17  75   3  94  67  67  83  36
2  19  19  37   4  18  10  60  59  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. The goal is to assign items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. Given the constraint of having to allocate all items, we can apply a strategy that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 40 + 73 + 71 + 69 + 94 + 64 + 59 + 61 + 78 = 609
- Agent 1: 54 + 17 + 75 + 3 + 94 + 67 + 67 + 83 + 36 = 496
- Agent 2: 19 + 19 + 37 + 4 + 18 + 10 + 60 + 59 + 92 = 318

Based on these total valuations, we will aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0** has the highest total valuation. We will try to allocate items that maximize their perceived value without making other agents envious.

2. **Agent 1** has a moderate total valuation. We will aim to balance high-value items with low-value items to keep the distribution fair.

3. **Agent 2** has the lowest total valuation. We will ensure they get items they value highly to compensate for their overall lower valuations.

### Allocation Steps

- **Agent 0**: We aim to allocate high-value items based on Agent 0's preferences while considering the overall fairness.
  - Items: [4 (94), 1 (73), 0 (40)]

- **Agent 1**: We allocate items that Agent 1 values relatively higher compared to others.
  - Items: [2 (75), 7 (83), 5 (67)]

- **Agent 2**: We ensure Agent 2 receives items they value the most.
  - Items: [8 (92), 6 (60), 3 (4)]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 0],
    "1": [2, 7, 5],
    "2": [8, 6, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a manner that considers each agent's valuation and attempts to maintain envy-freeness by giving each agent a fair and desirable set of items based on their preferences.
