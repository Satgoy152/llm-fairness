Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  95  79  26  60  16  74  98  82
1   4  99  65  11   0  13  36  98  71
2  12  33  73  77  52  77  27  87  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that each agent believes they have received a bundle of items at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle, according to their own valuations.

Let's consider a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, 7, and 8.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 7 as well, but also values item 2 significantly.
   - Agent 2 has moderate valuations for items 2, 3, 5, and 7.

2. **Allocating High-Value Items:**
   - Item 1 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. To break the tie, we might consider balancing the overall utility across all items.
   - Item 7 is also highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 1. We can allocate it to one of them to balance their overall utility.

3. **Balancing the Allocation:**
   - Allocate items in such a way that each agent receives a mix of high and low-value items, aiming to equalize the perceived value.

4. **Allocation Proposal:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 8 (High total valuation)
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 7, 6 (High total valuation)
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 4, 5 (Moderate total valuation)

This allocation attempts to balance the overall perceived value by each agent:

- **Agent 0** gets high-value items according to their valuation.
- **Agent 1** receives a mix that balances high-value items and moderate-value items.
- **Agent 2** receives items that have moderate valuations across the board.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [2, 7, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with an attempt to minimize envy.
