Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  30  42  26  19  15  29  70  58
1  50  16  40  13   9  49  60  44  27
2  98  42  94   1   4  88  85  72  95
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own, given the valuations.

Let's first summarize the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(60 + 30 + 42 + 26 + 19 + 15 + 29 + 70 + 58 = 349\)
- Agent 1: \(50 + 16 + 40 + 13 + 9 + 49 + 60 + 44 + 27 = 308\)
- Agent 2: \(98 + 42 + 94 + 1 + 4 + 88 + 85 + 72 + 95 = 579\)

Considering these totals, Agent 2 values the items the most, hence, might be harder to satisfy in terms of envy-freeness. We'll aim to distribute items while keeping these total valuations in mind.

One approach is to start by allocating the highest-valued items to the agents who value them the most, and then iteratively assign the remaining items:

1. **Allocate highest-value items:**
   - Item 0 to Agent 2 (value: 98)
   - Item 1 to Agent 2 (value: 42)
   - Item 2 to Agent 2 (value: 94)
   - Item 5 to Agent 2 (value: 88)
   - Item 8 to Agent 2 (value: 95)

2. **Check remaining items and values:**
   - Remaining: Items 3, 4, 6, 7
   - Agent 0 highest remaining values: Item 7 (70), Item 6 (29)
   - Agent 1 highest remaining values: Item 6 (60), Item 7 (44)
   
3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Item 3 to Agent 0 (value: 26)
   - Item 4 to Agent 1 (value: 9)
   - Item 6 to Agent 1 (value: 60)
   - Item 7 to Agent 0 (value: 70)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 4, 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8

These allocations are based on maximizing the agents' preferences with an aim to maintain a balanced distribution.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]
}
```
