Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  45  86   6  88  44  94  89  42
1  55  45  94  71  33   2  72  91  39
2  10  31  84  37  84   8  87   0  97
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents where the allocation is envy-free, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be challenging, especially with integer allocations, but we will strive to create a reasonable distribution based on the given valuations.

Let's first consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 552
- Agent 1: 502
- Agent 2: 438

Next, let's allocate items by trying to balance the total value each agent receives. We will attempt to ensure each agent's allocation is as close to their preferred items as possible while maintaining fairness.

Here is an allocation that aims to be as envy-free as possible:

- Allocate items 0, 4, and 7 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 2, 3, and 6 to Agent 1.
- Allocate items 1, 5, and 8 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 58 (item 0) + 88 (item 4) + 89 (item 7) = 235
- Agent 1: 94 (item 2) + 71 (item 3) + 72 (item 6) = 237
- Agent 2: 45 (item 1) + 8 (item 5) + 97 (item 8) = 150

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations.
