Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  47  97  37  32  37  90  49  65
1  72  26  46  55  64  78  70  63  89
2  69  39  40  74  48  74  90  55  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to the others. We'll use the valuations provided to achieve this.

First, let's summarize the total valuations for each agent based on their preferences:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 82 + 47 + 97 + 37 + 32 + 37 + 90 + 49 + 65 = 536
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 72 + 26 + 46 + 55 + 64 + 78 + 70 + 63 + 89 = 563
- Agent 2: Total valuation = 69 + 39 + 40 + 74 + 48 + 74 + 90 + 55 + 91 = 580

Now, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as equal as possible, considering their total valuations.

After analyzing the valuations, a balanced allocation can be determined as follows:

1. Allocate high-value items first to spread the total value fairly.
2. Ensure every agent receives items that keep their perceived value close to others.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 4, 8]
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 5, 6]

Let's check the perceived value for each agent:

- Agent 0's items' total valuation: 82 (item 0) + 37 (item 3) + 49 (item 7) = 168
- Agent 1's items' total valuation: 26 (item 1) + 64 (item 4) + 89 (item 8) = 179
- Agent 2's items' total valuation: 40 (item 2) + 74 (item 5) + 90 (item 6) = 204

This allocation ensures a fairly balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
