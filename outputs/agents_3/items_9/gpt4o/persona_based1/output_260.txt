Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  64  30  42   6  88  58  69  85
1   3  94  50  98  64  68   6  70  36
2  82  55   3   5  94  90  13  50  55
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction. This involves ensuring that each agent gets a bundle of items such that no agent envies another's allocation.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(5 + 64 + 30 + 42 + 6 + 88 + 58 + 69 + 85 = 447\)
- Agent 1: \(3 + 94 + 50 + 98 + 64 + 68 + 6 + 70 + 36 = 489\)
- Agent 2: \(82 + 55 + 3 + 5 + 94 + 90 + 13 + 50 + 55 = 447\)

Next, we will try to allocate items to reduce envy, meaning each agent should ideally get items that they highly value, while also balancing the overall distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 3 (98) and item 1 (94). We will assign these to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (94) and item 0 (82). We will assign these to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0** highly values item 8 (85). We will assign this to Agent 0.

Now, we will allocate the remaining items to balance out the valuations:

- Assign item 5 (88) to Agent 0 (since it's also valued highly by Agent 0).
- Assign item 6 (13) to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it higher than others).
- Assign item 2 (50) to Agent 1 (since it's valued relatively high by Agent 1).
- Assign item 7 (70) to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it highly).
- Assign item 9 (55) to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it higher than others).

Finally, let's verify and finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [8, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 1, 2, 7]
- Agent 2: [4, 0, 6, 9]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and no agent has a reason to envy another's bundle based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [3, 1, 2, 7],
    "2": [4, 0, 6, 9]
}
```
