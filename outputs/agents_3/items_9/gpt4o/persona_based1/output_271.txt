Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  54  82  67  92  28  70  59  18
1  35  23  83  40  87  59  53  61  94
2  94  14  21  94   0  28  18  53  91
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12 54 82 67 92 28 70 59 18]
 [35 23 83 40 87 59 53 61 94]
 [94 14 21 94  0 28 18 53 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 12 + 54 + 82 + 67 + 92 + 28 + 70 + 59 + 18 = 482
- Agent 1: 35 + 23 + 83 + 40 + 87 + 59 + 53 + 61 + 94 = 535
- Agent 2: 94 + 14 + 21 + 94 + 0 + 28 + 18 + 53 + 91 = 413

Next, we will attempt to allocate items to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their valuations. We will try to assign items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, if possible.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize items with high value for agent 0: item 4 (92), item 2 (82), item 6 (70).
2. **Agent 1:** Prioritize items with high value for agent 1: item 8 (94), item 2 (83) (already assigned to agent 0), item 4 (87) (already assigned to agent 0), item 7 (61).
3. **Agent 2:** Prioritize items with high value for agent 2: item 0 (94), item 3 (94), item 8 (91) (already assigned to agent 1).

Let's proceed with a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [4, 6, 2] for total value = 92 + 70 + 82 = 244
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [8, 5, 7] for total value = 94 + 59 + 61 = 214
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [0, 1, 3] for total value = 94 + 14 + 94 = 202

We have allocated all 9 items, and each agent has received 3 items. This allocation tries to maximize each agent's perceived value and minimize envy. 

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6, 2],
    "1": [8, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
