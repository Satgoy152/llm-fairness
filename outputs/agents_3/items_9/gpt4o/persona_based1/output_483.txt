Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  41  44   1  76  57   3  73  14
1  41  73  77  19  68  27  94  79  43
2  32  15   6  41  88  61  16  20  78
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle. However, achieving absolute envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with an uneven distribution of item values and limited agents/items. In this case, we'll attempt to balance the total values each agent receives.

Here are the steps involved in the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 35 + 41 + 44 + 1 + 76 + 57 + 3 + 73 + 14 = 344
   - Agent 1: 41 + 73 + 77 + 19 + 68 + 27 + 94 + 79 + 43 = 521
   - Agent 2: 32 + 15 + 6 + 41 + 88 + 61 + 16 + 20 + 78 = 357

2. **Determine Initial Allocation Based on Preferences:**
   - Assign items starting from the agent with the highest valuation for each item, while trying to balance the total value allocated to each agent.

3. **Iterative Adjustments for Balance:**
   - After initial allocation, make adjustments to attempt to equalize the values as much as possible between agents.

Following this process, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 7]
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 6]

This allocation is designed to balance the total valuation across agents while respecting their preferences as much as possible.

Finally, the allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
