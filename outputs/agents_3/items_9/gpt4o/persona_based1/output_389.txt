Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  45  52   4  88  19   3  52   7
1  64  47  54   4  67  28  90   4  54
2   9  16  16  51  20  67  90  82  10
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations for each item by each agent, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate the items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value per Agent**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items as a reference for their overall preferences.
   - Agent 0: \(86 + 45 + 52 + 4 + 88 + 19 + 3 + 52 + 7 = 356\)
   - Agent 1: \(64 + 47 + 54 + 4 + 67 + 28 + 90 + 4 + 54 = 412\)
   - Agent 2: \(9 + 16 + 16 + 51 + 20 + 67 + 90 + 82 + 10 = 361\)

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Determine which items are most valued by each agent. We will try to allocate some of these items to each agent to ensure satisfaction.
   - Agent 0's top values: Item 4 (88), Item 0 (86)
   - Agent 1's top values: Item 6 (90), Item 4 (67)
   - Agent 2's top values: Item 6 (90), Item 7 (82)

3. **Allocate Items**: Start by giving each agent one or more of their top-valued items to ensure initial satisfaction, and then distribute remaining items to balance overall satisfaction.

   - **Allocate high-value items**:
     - Item 0 to Agent 0
     - Item 6 to Agent 1 (also highly valued by Agent 2, but Agent 1 has the highest total valuation)
     - Item 7 to Agent 2

   - **Distribute remaining items to balance total value**:
     - Agent 0: Items 1, 4 (ensures high-value satisfaction)
     - Agent 1: Items 2, 8
     - Agent 2: Items 3, 5

4. **Check for Envy-freeness**: No agent should prefer another's allocation over their own. Given the distribution, each agent received items that maximize their individual satisfaction based on their preferences.

The allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 6, 8],
    "2": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent and ensures no significant envy based on the given valuations.
