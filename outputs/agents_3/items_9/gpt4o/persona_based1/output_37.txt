Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  65  65  32  26  37  47  37  59
1   6  67  70  73  94  39  91  34  50
2  40  85  66  25  76  52  41  27  32
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [40 85 66 25 76 52 41 27 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while focusing on envy-freeness, we will aim to give each agent a set of items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations, we can approach this by trying to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents while considering their individual preferences. Let's proceed step-by-step to find a fair allocation.

### Valuations Matrix:
```
Agent 0: [49, 65, 65, 32, 26, 37, 47, 37, 59]
Agent 1: [6, 67, 70, 73, 94, 39, 91, 34, 50]
Agent 2: [40, 85, 66, 25, 76, 52, 41, 27, 32]
```

### Steps to Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Matches**: We start by looking at the highest values each agent has for different items.

2. **Initial Allocation by Highest Preference**:
    - Agent 0 values items 1 and 2 at 65 the highest, followed by 0 at 49.
    - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 94, followed by 6 at 91.
    - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 85, followed by 4 at 76.

3. **Avoid Conflicts by Reallocation**:
    - Since item 1 is highly valued by both Agents 0 and 2, and Agent 2 values it the most, we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation among all items for any agent).
    - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (top choice among remaining items for Agent 0).

4. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as it has a high valuation for both items 1 and 2.
    - Next, allocate item 3 to Agent 1 and item 5 to Agent 2, based on their next highest preferences.
    - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest value 91).
    - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 and item 8 to Agent 0 to balance out the number of items each agent receives.

5. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Each agent should have the same number of items (3 items each in this case) for a fair division.

### Final Fair Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their preferences, while distributing the items as evenly as possible among the agents.
