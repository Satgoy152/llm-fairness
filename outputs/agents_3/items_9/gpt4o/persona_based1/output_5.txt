Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  49  22  54  71  85  68  54  25
1  82  45  95   2  72  10   8  25  61
2   5  66  40  64   3  65  71  92   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which balances efficiency and fairness by maximizing the product of the valuations of the items allocated to each agent.

Let's calculate a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Total valuation for items: \(16 + 49 + 22 + 54 + 71 + 85 + 68 + 54 + 25 = 444\)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Total valuation for items: \(82 + 45 + 95 + 2 + 72 + 10 + 8 + 25 + 61 = 400\)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Total valuation for items: \(5 + 66 + 40 + 64 + 3 + 65 + 71 + 92 + 5 = 411\)

Given the above valuations, the goal is to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced and as high as possible without causing envy.

Allocation Strategy:
- Prioritize items based on the highest individual valuation for each item.
- Ensure each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** 
  - Items: 5, 6, 7
  - Total valuation: \(85 + 68 + 54 = 207\)

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Items: 0, 2, 4
  - Total valuation: \(82 + 95 + 72 = 249\)

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Items: 1, 3, 8
  - Total valuation: \(66 + 64 + 5 = 135\)

While this allocation does not perfectly balance the total valuations, it aims to maximize the efficiency and fairness given the constraints.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 3, 8]
}
```
