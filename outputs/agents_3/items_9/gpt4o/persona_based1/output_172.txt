Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  47  71  98  58  95  89  67  28
1  75  23  57  52  22  43  30  13  47
2  47  16  66  43  10  60  49  40  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction to ensure some level of fairness and attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation. In this context, we can consider each agent's satisfaction as the sum of their valuations for the items they receive. Our goal is to make sure that each agent has a reasonably balanced allocation based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for most items, especially items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 has moderate valuations, with item 0 being valued highly.
- Agent 2 has lower valuations overall, but relatively higher for item 2 and item 5.

Given these valuations, a good strategy is to allocate items to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring they don't envy others' allocations.

### Proposed Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.
   - Allocate items [0, 3, 5] as these have high values for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocate items that are relatively high for Agent 1 but not as high for others to keep the allocation fair.
   - Allocate items [1, 7, 8] to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Allocate remaining items that Agent 2 values relatively higher.
   - Allocate items [2, 4, 6] to Agent 2.

This distribution attempts to balance the perceived values and keep each agent's allocation reasonably fair.

Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 7, 8],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
