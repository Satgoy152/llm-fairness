Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  21  94  28  68  33  61  22  46
1  59   5  45  99  82  57  47  70  33
2   8  49  86  14  36  14   0  24  67
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives. 

The valuations of the items by the agents are given as:

- Agent 0: [11, 21, 94, 28, 68, 33, 61, 22, 46]
- Agent 1: [59, 5, 45, 99, 82, 57, 47, 70, 33]
- Agent 2: [8, 49, 86, 14, 36, 14, 0, 24, 67]

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: We will try to allocate items that maximize agent 0's utility while keeping a balance. High-value items for agent 0 are 2 (94), 4 (68), and 6 (61). Start by assigning items 2, 4, and 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: High-value items for Agent 1 are 3 (99), 4 (82), and 0 (59). Since item 4 is already assigned to agent 0, assign items 3 and 0 to agent 1 initially.

3. **Agent 2**: High-value items for agent 2 are 2 (86), 8 (67), and 1 (49). Item 2 is assigned to agent 0, so assign items 8 and 1 to agent 2 initially.

Now, reconsider the leftover items and ensure every agent gets a fair share:

- Remaining items after initial allocation: 5, 7.
  
Let's distribute these remaining items:

- Give item 5 to agent 1 (value 57).
- Give item 7 to agent 2 (value 24).

Now, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 7, 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives three items, and the distribution attempts to maximize each agent's utility while keeping the allocation as fair as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [1, 7, 8]
}
```
