Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  55  27  23  81  43  37  13  82
1  89  58  87  87  41  49  46  43   6
2  52  72  44  56  97  90  43  71  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 8 (82), 4 (81), 1 (55)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (89), 2 (87), 3 (87)

3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (97), 5 (90), 1 (72)

### Initial Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Start by assigning item 8 (highest value for agent 0).
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 0 (highest value for agent 1).
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 4 (highest value for agent 2).

### Further Allocation:
- After the initial highest valued items are allocated, continue to allocate remaining items considering each agent's next highest valued items while avoiding conflicts:
  
- **Agent 0:** Assign item 1 and item 6 (next highest values after 8).
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 2 and item 3 (next highest values after 0).
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 5, item 7 (next highest values after 4).

### Final Allocation:
This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are highly valued by them, and the allocations are as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items among the agents while attempting to respect their individual preferences and aims to minimize envy.
