Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  84  31  55  14   6  73  81  86
1  72  25  69  90  54   3  32  65  22
2  41  29  26  62  49  41  78  84  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent values their allocation as much as possible. We will try to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation by valuing their own allocation at least as much as they would value another agent's allocation.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(0 + 84 + 31 + 55 + 14 + 6 + 73 + 81 + 86 = 430\)
- Agent 1: \(72 + 25 + 69 + 90 + 54 + 3 + 32 + 65 + 22 = 432\)
- Agent 2: \(41 + 29 + 26 + 62 + 49 + 41 + 78 + 84 + 36 = 446\)

Now, let's allocate the items, trying to maximize the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items with higher value based on Agent 0's valuation:
   - Item 8: 86
   - Item 7: 81
   - Item 1: 84
   - Total value for Agent 0: 86 + 81 + 84 = 251

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items with higher value based on Agent 1's valuation:
   - Item 3: 90
   - Item 2: 69
   - Item 0: 72
   - Total value for Agent 1: 90 + 69 + 72 = 231

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with higher value based on Agent 2's valuation:
   - Item 6: 78
   - Item 7: 84 (already taken, so skip)
   - Item 5: 41
   - Item 4: 49
   - Total value for Agent 2: 78 + 41 + 49 = 168

Reassign to make sure each agent has exactly 3 items, while maintaining fairness to the best extent:

- Agent 0: [8, 7, 1]
- Agent 1: [3, 2, 0]
- Agent 2: [6, 5, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives 3 items.

Final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 7, 1],
    "1": [3, 2, 0],
    "2": [6, 5, 4]
}
```

Note: The allocation aims to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's total value based on their preferences. Adjustments were made to ensure each agent receives 3 items.
