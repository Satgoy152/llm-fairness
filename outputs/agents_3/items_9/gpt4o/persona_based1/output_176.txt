Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  47  85  58  93  23  98  25  58
1  52  43  28  88  95  40  27  79  64
2  12  52  96  42  94  64  70  86  46
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. We aim to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy between the agents, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we can consider the following approach:
1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one-by-one, prioritizing the agent who values the item the most, while ensuring each agent gets approximately equal total value.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 42 + 47 + 85 + 58 + 93 + 23 + 98 + 25 + 58 = 529
- Agent 1's total valuation: 52 + 43 + 28 + 88 + 95 + 40 + 27 + 79 + 64 = 516
- Agent 2's total valuation: 12 + 52 + 96 + 42 + 94 + 64 + 70 + 86 + 46 = 562

Next, allocate items to agents based on their individual valuations:

1. Item 6 (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 4 (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2 (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
4. Item 8 (Agent 1 values higher than others): Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 0 (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 3 (valued highest by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
7. Item 7 (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
8. Item 1 (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
9. Item 5 (Agent 2 values higher than others): Assign to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent receives, while respecting their preferences for individual items.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0, 1],
    "1": [4, 8, 3],
    "2": [2, 7, 5]
}
```
