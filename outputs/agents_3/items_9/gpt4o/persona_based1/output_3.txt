Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  67  13  74  11  57  89  81   7
1  65  12   4  15  65  10  50  58  40
2  71  40  14   4  62  44  99  77  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the three agents, we can use an envy-free approach. One common method is to use a round-robin algorithm, where each agent takes turns picking the most valuable item available to them until all items are allocated. This approach attempts to ensure each agent gets items that are most valuable to them, reducing envy.

Here's how the allocation can be performed:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (value 89).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 65).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6, but since it's already assigned, they pick item 0 with the next highest value (value 71).

We continue this process, allowing each agent to pick their most valued item that is still available:

4. **Agent 0** picks item 3 (value 74).
5. **Agent 1** picks item 4 (value 65).
6. **Agent 2** picks item 7 (value 77).

Continuing the allocation:

7. **Agent 0** picks item 7, but since it's already taken, they pick item 1 (value 67).
8. **Agent 1** picks item 8 (value 40).
9. **Agent 2** picks item 5 (value 44).

After this round-robin allocation, we need to ensure all items have been assigned:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 3, 1
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4, 8
- Agent 2: Items 7, 2, 5

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4, 8],
    "2": [7, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets the most valued items available to them in a fair round-robin manner, attempting to minimize envy among the agents.
