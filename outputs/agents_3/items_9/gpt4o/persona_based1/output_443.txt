Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  58  48  56  24  36  67  45  19
1  89  31  70  34  75   3  25  33  74
2  14  79  48   9  83  13  74  95  14
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This is a classic problem in fair division, and one approach is to use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction or attempting to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (67), Item 3 (56), Item 1 (58)
   - Allocate: Items 1, 3, 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (89), Item 4 (75), Item 2 (70)
   - Allocate: Items 0, 2, 4

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 4 (83), Item 1 (79)
   - After removing allocations given to other agents, allocate: Items 5, 7, 8

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby minimizing envy.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [5, 7, 8]
}
```
