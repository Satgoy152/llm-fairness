Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  26  98  39  50  84  35  20  55
1  19  50  38  19  71   7  86  46   3
2   4  67  90  54  57  97  59  90  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that considers envy-freeness, it is essential to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their own valuations. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy among the agents.

Below is a suggested allocation using the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Valuations suggest that Agent 0 highly values items 2, 5, and 0. Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them high perceived value.
- **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 highly, followed by item 4. Allocating these items to Agent 1 gives them a strong perceived value.
- **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5, 2, and 7. Items 5 and 2 are already taken, so Agent 2 can be given item 3, which is also highly valued by them.

Hereâ€™s the allocation based on these considerations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, 7, 8

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 7, 8]
}
```
