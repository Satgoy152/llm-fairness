Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  36  54  38  75  88   7  95  24
1  91  23  45   6   9  86  71  19  34
2  28  56   2   2  30  82   9  39  62
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent values their bundle as highly as possible compared to the bundles of the other agents. Given that we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally receive 3 items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items to guide our allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 82 + 36 + 54 + 38 + 75 + 88 + 7 + 95 + 24 = 499
- Agent 1's total valuation: 91 + 23 + 45 + 6 + 9 + 86 + 71 + 19 + 34 = 384
- Agent 2's total valuation: 28 + 56 + 2 + 2 + 30 + 82 + 9 + 39 + 62 = 292

Based on these totals, Agent 0 values the items the most, followed by Agent 1, and then Agent 2. 

Let's proceed with the allocation by considering the highest individual valuations each agent has for particular items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 5 (88), 7 (95), and 0 (82).
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0 (91), 5 (86), and 6 (71).
3. Agent 2 highly values items 5 (82), 8 (62), and 1 (56).

Considering these preferences, let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7, 8 (Values: 82, 95, 24)
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6, 4 (Values: 86, 71, 9)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, 3 (Values: 56, 2, 2)

Now, we can ensure that the allocation respects the integer constraint and is as envy-free as possible within this setup.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 8],
    "1": [5, 6, 4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
