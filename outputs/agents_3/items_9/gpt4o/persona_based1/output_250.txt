Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  40  53  75  89  65  69  72   2
1   6  79  86  35  49   7  20  44  81
2  50  17  21   5  13  83   2  49  84
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has received a better collection of items based on their own valuations. 

Given the provided valuations, we can use a round-robin algorithm or a variation of the adjusted winner procedure to ensure a fair distribution. I'll consider each agent's valuations and distribute items iteratively, ensuring that each agent's allocation is balanced with others. 

Here's a possible allocation that considers fairness and attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations are on items 4 (89), 3 (75), and 7 (72).
   - Allocate items: 3, 4, 7

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations are on items 2 (86), 1 (79), and 8 (81).
   - Allocate items: 1, 2, 8

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations are on items 5 (83), 8 (84), and 0 (50).
   - Allocation preference for item 8 is higher than agent 1, but agent 1 has more high-value items available.
   - Allocate items: 0, 5, 6 

This allocation tries to balance the high-value items among agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair share according to their own valuations. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 2, 8],
    "2": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items relative to their personal valuations.
