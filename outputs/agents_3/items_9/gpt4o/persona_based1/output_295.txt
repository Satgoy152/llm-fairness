Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  81  36  38  94  20  59  65  46
1   7  92  50  49  42   3  73  26  86
2  90  88  76   6  86  63  73  51  39
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. Here, we'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Focus on high-valued items according to their preference.
2. **Agent 1:** Aim to provide a balanced distribution considering their high valuations.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate items that are highly valued by them but not by others to minimize envy.

After analyzing the valuations, let's distribute the items:

- **Agent 0:** Receives items 1, 4, 8. These items have high values for Agent 0, maximizing their satisfaction.
- **Agent 1:** Receives items 2, 5, 7. The values for these items are relatively high for Agent 1 and provide a satisfactory distribution.
- **Agent 2:** Receives items 0, 3, 6. These items are highly valued by Agent 2 and not as crucial for others.

This distribution tries to balance each agent's preferences and minimize envy across the board.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 8],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 3, 6]
}
```
