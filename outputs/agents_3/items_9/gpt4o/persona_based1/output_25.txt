Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  74  32  96  49   2  78  19  49
1   0  69  90  70  61  25  20  40  97
2  55   5  75  92  35  82  74  31  29
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving strict envy-freeness can be challenging in discrete allocations. Therefore, we aim for a balanced distribution based on the given valuations.

Let's first examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 74 + 32 + 96 + 49 + 2 + 78 + 19 + 49 = 442
- Agent 1's total valuation: 0 + 69 + 90 + 70 + 61 + 25 + 20 + 40 + 97 = 472
- Agent 2's total valuation: 55 + 5 + 75 + 92 + 35 + 82 + 74 + 31 + 29 = 478

Next, let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation while attempting to keep the allocations as fair as possible.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (96), 6 (78), 1 (74)
   - Allocation: [3, 6, 1]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 8 (97), 2 (90), 3 (70)
   - Allocation: [8, 2, 4]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (82), 3 (92), 2 (75)
   - Allocation: [5, 0, 7]

However, note that item 3 has been allocated to more than one agent. To resolve this conflict and ensure each item is uniquely allocated, we need to adjust allocations while considering the next highest valued items for each agent. 

Let's re-adjust:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Keep 3 (96) and 1 (74), add 7 (19)
  - New allocation: [3, 1, 7]

- **Agent 1**:
  - Keep 8 (97) and 2 (90), add 4 (61)
  - New allocation: [8, 2, 4]

- **Agent 2**:
  - Keep 5 (82), add 0 (55) and 6 (74)
  - New allocation: [5, 0, 6]

Now, let's verify:
- Total items allocated: 3 (Agent 0) + 3 (Agent 1) + 3 (Agent 2) = 9

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 7],
    "1": [8, 2, 4],
    "2": [5, 0, 6]
}
```
