Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22   5  41  46  17  36  28  95  85
1   5  65  90   6  35  22  70  41  10
2  73  40  41  30  63   9  34  95  76
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their own valuations. Hereâ€™s a way to allocate the items:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 7 (value 95).
   - Next highest valued item is item 8 (value 85).
   - Next, select item 3 (value 46).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 90).
   - Next highest valued item is item 1 (value 65).
   - Next, select item 6 (value 70).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 7, but it is allocated to Agent 0; hence, next is item 0 (value 73).
   - Next highest valued item is item 8, but it is allocated to Agent 0; hence, next is item 4 (value 63).
   - Next, select item 5 (value 9).

### Allocation:

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that have high values according to their own valuation, distributing the items in a manner that should minimize envy among the agents.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8, 3],
    "1": [2, 1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives 3 items, totaling 9 items, and the allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
