Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  43  35  56  94  45  53  10  14
1  30  32  24  40   4  85  67  91  94
2  95  52  15  11  83  81   9  20   8
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the three agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can utilize an approach that balances the valuations each agent has for their allocated items. Below is one possible allocation that attempts to minimize envy among the agents:

1. **Determine Total Valuations:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined:
     - Agent 0: \(64 + 43 + 35 + 56 + 94 + 45 + 53 + 10 + 14 = 414\)
     - Agent 1: \(30 + 32 + 24 + 40 + 4 + 85 + 67 + 91 + 94 = 467\)
     - Agent 2: \(95 + 52 + 15 + 11 + 83 + 81 + 9 + 20 + 8 = 374\)

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Try to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a relatively equal share of their total valuation.

3. **Example Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their valuation without causing significant envy.
   - **Agent 1**: Select items that maximize their valuation, considering remaining high-value items.
   - **Agent 2**: Allocate remaining items while attempting to balance total valuation.

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 4] 
  - Total Value: \(64 + 94 = 158\)
  
- **Agent 1**: [5, 7, 8]
  - Total Value: \(85 + 91 + 94 = 270\)
  
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2, 3, 6]
  - Total Value: \(52 + 15 + 11 + 9 = 87\)

This allocation aims to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation for their items is more balanced, minimizing the potential for envy.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures all 9 items are allocated and attempts to provide a fair division given the agents' valuations.
