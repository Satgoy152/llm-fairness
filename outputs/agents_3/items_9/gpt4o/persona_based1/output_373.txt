Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  42  16  90  27  53  27  65  66
1  65  82  58  47  68  90  40  61  15
2  47  36   4  20  89  49  39  50   9
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. This can be challenging, especially when agents have different valuations for the items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items, which helps in understanding their preferences and priorities.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Distribute items based on the highest valuation for each item. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This might not result in an envy-free allocation but serves as a starting point.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Review the allocation to ensure no agent envies another. If an agent values another agent's items more than their own, consider swapping items to reduce envy.

4. **Balance the Number of Items:** Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

5. **Iterate if Needed:** If the initial allocation is not envy-free or balanced in terms of item count, iterate and adjust by swapping or re-allocating items until the conditions are met.

Using this method, let's provide a fair allocation for the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [3, 8] - prefers items with high personal value.
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5] - chooses items with substantial personal valuation.
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 6, 7] - takes remaining items maximizing their value.

This distribution ensures a fair allocation where each agent has items they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2, 6, 7]
}
```
