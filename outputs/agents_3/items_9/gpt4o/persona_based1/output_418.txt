Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  53  44  17  31  53  68  43  85
1  52   1   8  92  45  62  49  66  50
2   6  44   1   6  26  89  60   6   5
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. This allocation method often leads to envy-free (or close to envy-free) allocations when the number of items is divisible among the agents.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process using the MNW principle:

1. **List Agent Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [78, 53, 44, 17, 31, 53, 68, 43, 85]
   - Agent 1: [52, 1, 8, 92, 45, 62, 49, 66, 50]
   - Agent 2: [6, 44, 1, 6, 26, 89, 60, 6, 5]

2. **Allocate Items:**

   - **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0, focusing on items 0 and 8.
   - **Agent 1**: High-value items for Agent 1 include item 3.
   - **Agent 2**: High-value items for Agent 2 include item 5 and item 6.

3. **Allocation:** We aim to balance the allocations to achieve a fair distribution:

   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 8] (Values: 78, 53, 85)
   - Agent 1: [3, 4, 7] (Values: 92, 45, 66)
   - Agent 2: [2, 5, 6] (Values: 1, 89, 60)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high personal value, minimizing envy among them.

4. **Final Allocations in JSON:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation method respects the agents' preferences and attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, contributing to an envy-free or nearly envy-free allocation.
