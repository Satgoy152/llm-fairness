Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  58  29  73   0  49  84  48  59
1  67  35  56  33  22  93   8   6  24
2  36  19  53  94  56  60   0  48  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Here are the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(35 + 58 + 29 + 73 + 0 + 49 + 84 + 48 + 59 = 435\)
- Agent 1: \(67 + 35 + 56 + 33 + 22 + 93 + 8 + 6 + 24 = 344\)
- Agent 2: \(36 + 19 + 53 + 94 + 56 + 60 + 0 + 48 + 37 = 403\)

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's allocation is as close to their "fair share" as possible. The fair share for each agent is \(\text{(total value of all items)}/3 \approx 394\).

Let's use a simple method to allocate the items, attempting to prioritize each agent's highest valued items while ensuring envy-freeness as best as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Sort each agent's valuations in descending order.
2. Allocate the highest valued remaining item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent ends up with a share significantly above the average.

### Item Allocation:

Based on the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations: [6 (84), 3 (73), 1 (58)]
- Agent 1's highest valuations: [5 (93), 0 (67), 2 (56)]
- Agent 2's highest valuations: [3 (94), 5 (60), 4 (56)]

#### Steps:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2, second-highest for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (second-highest for Agent 1).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (third-highest for Agent 0).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (third-highest for Agent 1).
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (second-highest for Agent 2).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
9. Allocate item 8 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 7],
    "1": [5, 0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that they highly value, and the distribution tries to balance the total value each agent receives.
