Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  46  84  64  70  79  35  26  20
1  44  77  82  10  78  65  38   6  23
2  39  10  50  84  52  64  75  16  61
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division among the three agents, it’s essential to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use algorithms like the Envy-Free Matching or the Maximum Nash Welfare, which aim to create allocations that are as fair as possible.

In this particular scenario, given the limited number of agents and items, it can be helpful to manually analyze and allocate the items to achieve a balanced distribution. Here’s one possible allocation that aims for a fair division:

- Agent 0 seems to highly value items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 seems to highly value items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 seems to highly value items 3, 6, and 8.

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3, 6, 8

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly, thereby reducing envy and aiming for a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```
