Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  73  21   2  77  62  37  39  60
1  57  97   9  45  22  83  23   4  53
2  32  67  95  40  37  34  55  22  38
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received the best possible set of items given the circumstances. We can use a method known as the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" to ensure a sort of fair distribution, though true envy-freeness can be complex with integer allocations.

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation approach, assuming agents pick items based on their valuations, and we aim to minimize potential envy:

1. **First Round of Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 77)
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 97)
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 95)

2. **Second Round of Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 62)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5, but it's already picked by Agent 0, so next best available: item 0 (value 57)
   - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 55)

3. **Third Round of Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 8 (value 60)
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 45)
   - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 22)

At this point, all 9 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 0, 3],
    "2": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives three items, and we attempted to maximize the value for each agent in a sequential manner. While this method does not guarantee envy-freeness, it provides a structured and balanced allocation given the constraints.
