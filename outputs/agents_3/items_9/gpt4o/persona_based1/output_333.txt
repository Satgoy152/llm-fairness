Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  55  87  76  69   0  19  49  62
1   5  91  51  75  69  25   2  68  24
2  93   0  90  57   0  19  10  19  12
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with the goal of minimizing envy, we can use the method of ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Here's an allocation strategy that maintains fairness and attempts to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: We should prioritize giving Agent 0 the items they value the most. Items 2 (87), 3 (76), and 1 (55) are their top choices.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, Agent 1 should receive items that they value highly. Items 1 (91), 3 (75), and 4 (69) are their top preferences.
3. **Agent 2**: Finally, Agent 2 should receive items that they value the most. Items 0 (93), 2 (90), and 3 (57) are their top choices.

Considering the goal of balancing fairness with the constraints, we will distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is considered, and each item is allocated only once. 

Here's a viable allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 7, 8] 
  - Total value: 87 (item 2) + 49 (item 7) + 62 (item 8) = 198
- **Agent 1**: [1, 3, 4]
  - Total value: 91 (item 1) + 75 (item 3) + 69 (item 4) = 235
- **Agent 2**: [0, 5, 6]
  - Total value: 93 (item 0) + 19 (item 5) + 10 (item 6) = 122

This allocation ensures that each agent gets three items and maximizes their perceived value while making sure all items are allocated fairly. 

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of allocating all 9 items while attempting to distribute value fairly among the agents.
