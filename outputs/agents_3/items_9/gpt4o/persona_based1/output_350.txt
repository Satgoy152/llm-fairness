Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  65  95  22  11  34  82  52  38
1  78  79  56  54  49  70  22  29  26
2   8  49  98  17  27  11  34  83  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. One possible approach to achieve this is to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for each agent given their allocated items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 1.
   - Allocate items 2, 6, and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
   - Allocate items 0, 5 to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 7, and 3.
   - Allocate items 3, 7, 4, 8 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuations for the items.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 7, 4, 8]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 7, 4, and 8. 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair portion based on their valuations.
