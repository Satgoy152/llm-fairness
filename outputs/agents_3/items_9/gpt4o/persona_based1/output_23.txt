Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  64  99  89  76  65  72  20   4
1  34  46  30  34  86  83  99  45  37
2  42   2  41  60  60  96  21  95  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free and fair, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation and doesn't prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One method to achieve this is to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 68 + 64 + 99 + 89 + 76 + 65 + 72 + 20 + 4 = 557
- Agent 1: 34 + 46 + 30 + 34 + 86 + 83 + 99 + 45 + 37 = 494
- Agent 2: 42 + 2 + 41 + 60 + 60 + 96 + 21 + 95 + 64 = 481

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items so that each agent receives a fair share of the total value according to their valuations and ideally each agent gets 3 items, since we have 9 items and 3 agents.

1. **Allocate to Agent 0:**
   - Choose items with the highest value for Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Value 99
   - Item 3: Value 89
   - Item 0: Value 68
   - Total value for Agent 0: 99 + 89 + 68 = 256

2. **Allocate to Agent 1:**
   - Choose items with the highest value for Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Value 99
   - Item 5: Value 83
   - Item 4: Value 86
   - Total value for Agent 1: 99 + 83 + 86 = 268

3. **Allocate to Agent 2:**
   - The remaining items are allocated to Agent 2.
   - Item 7: Value 95
   - Item 8: Value 64
   - Item 1: Value 2 
   - Total value for Agent 2: 95 + 64 + 2 = 161

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, and every agent receives exactly 3 items. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0],
    "1": [6, 5, 4],
    "2": [7, 8, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a share that's valuable to them and should minimize envy by giving priority to their highest valued items.
