Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  83  63  57  28   9   4  71   8
1  61   2  42  22  26  92  81  51  60
2  39  92  83  94  67  54  73  40  71
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. However, given the discrete nature of the items and the differing valuations, perfect envy-freeness might not be feasible, but we can try to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(6 + 83 + 63 + 57 + 28 + 9 + 4 + 71 + 8 = 329\)
- Agent 1: \(61 + 2 + 42 + 22 + 26 + 92 + 81 + 51 + 60 = 437\)
- Agent 2: \(39 + 92 + 83 + 94 + 67 + 54 + 73 + 40 + 71 = 613\)

Next, we aim to distribute items such that each agent gets a collection of items that is roughly proportional to their total valuations, while also trying to maximize individual satisfaction.

Let's proceed with a heuristic allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by selecting items that Agent 0 values highly.

   - Item 1 (83), Item 7 (71), and Item 2 (63).

2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that Agent 1 values highly, ideally not overlapping with Agent 0's high-value items.

   - Item 5 (92), Item 6 (81), and Item 8 (60).

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate remaining items, focusing on those highly valued by Agent 2.

   - Item 3 (94), Item 4 (67), and Item 0 (39).

After the initial allocation, each agent should have three items. This ensures that every item is allocated, and each agent gets a fair set of items based on their individual preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7, 2],
    "1": [5, 6, 8],
    "2": [3, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an equal number of items.
