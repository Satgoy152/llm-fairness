Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  84  59  16  58  18  17  96  26
1  13  10  14   8  80  58  38  32  91
2  78  32  62  43   3   2  97  72  37
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can utilize a combination of techniques often used in fair division problems. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the table given:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
    0  76  84  59  16  58  18  17  96  26
    1  13  10  14   8  80  58  38  32  91
    2  78  32  62  43   3   2  97  72  37
```

To ensure a fair allocation, we will aim to distribute the items by considering the highest value each agent places on an item while also making sure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one potential allocation that attempts to balance the interests:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (96), Item 1 (84)
   - Allocate Items: 7, 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (91), Item 4 (80), Item 5 (58)
   - Allocate Items: 8, 4, 5

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (97), Item 0 (78), Item 2 (62), Item 3 (43)
   - Allocate Items: 6, 0, 2, 3

This allocation respects the following:
- Each agent receives an integer number of items.
- All 9 items are allocated.

The allocation at the end in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 6]
}
```

This setup aims to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value, thereby achieving a fair division based on the provided valuations.
