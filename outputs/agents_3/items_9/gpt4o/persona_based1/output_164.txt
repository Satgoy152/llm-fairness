Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  74  60  12  51  44  22  73  90
1  14  22  10  31  52  52  27   2  60
2  29  39  19  80  97  96  35   9   3
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use principles from fair division, such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or trying to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible.

An effective approach for this problem is to use a maximin strategy, which aims to maximize the minimum value received by any agent. We'll also try to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation too much, keeping the allocations as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- High valuations: Items 1 (74), 2 (60), 7 (73), 8 (90)

Agent 1:
- High valuations: Items 4 (52), 5 (52), 8 (60)

Agent 2:
- High valuations: Items 3 (80), 4 (97), 5 (96)

Given these preferences, we'll assign items so that each agent receives a fair share according to their highest valuations, while ensuring the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 from their perspective.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values but are not highly valued by others.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items that Agent 2 highly values and items not highly valued by others.

### Allocations
- Assign high-value items to the agents that value them the most, ensuring no agent is left without a reasonable value.

After considering these factors, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 30 + 74 + 60 = 164

- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 52 + 52 + 60 = 164

- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 6, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 2: 80 + 35 + 9 = 124

This allocation ensures each agent receives exactly three items, and the total number of items allocated is 9. The allocation aims to balance the values each agent receives according to their preferences.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 8],
    "2": [3, 6, 7]
}
```
