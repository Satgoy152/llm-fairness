Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  61  14  11  32  31   2  13  96
1  14  77   7  89  78   8  95  55  23
2  30  36  56   4  22   5  10  21   0
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's bundle of goods over their own.

We'll start by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes utility for each agent:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 8 (96), Item 0 (84), Item 1 (61)
   
2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (89), Item 6 (95), Item 4 (78)
   
3. **Agent 2's Preferences:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (56), Item 1 (36), Item 0 (30)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Since their highest valuation is for Item 8, we allocate that to Agent 0. Next, we consider Item 0, which is also highly valued by Agent 2, so we look for other items Agent 0 values. Item 1 is also highly valued by Agent 0, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Agent 1 highly values Item 6 and Item 3. We allocate these items to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values Item 2 the most, so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2. Additionally, Agent 2 values Item 1, which has already been allocated. We allocate Item 0 to Agent 2 since it is their next highest valuation.

We continue this process while ensuring each agent receives items they value highly and maintaining a total of 9 items distributed.

Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 8, 1
- **Agent 1:** Items 6, 3, 4, 7
- **Agent 2:** Items 2, 0, 5

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [6, 3, 4, 7],
    "2": [2, 0, 5]
}
```
