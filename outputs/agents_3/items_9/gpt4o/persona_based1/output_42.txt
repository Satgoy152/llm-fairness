Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  91  96  44  12   3  83  25  63
1  43  22  50  16  13  59  75  13  12
2  62  59  91  10  39  95  93  74  34
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. We'll use a heuristic approach to achieve this.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 14 + 91 + 96 + 44 + 12 + 3 + 83 + 25 + 63 = 431
- Agent 1: 43 + 22 + 50 + 16 + 13 + 59 + 75 + 13 + 12 = 303
- Agent 2: 62 + 59 + 91 + 10 + 39 + 95 + 93 + 74 + 34 = 557

Now, let's try to allocate items in a way that balances these total values and attempts to minimize envy. We'll aim to give each agent a proportional share based on their total valuations.

Since we have 9 items and 3 agents, each agent should ideally get 3 items. Let's allocate them as follows:

1. Agent 0: We will select items that maximize their valuation. Items 2, 1, and 6 are among the highest valued by Agent 0, with values of 96, 91, and 83, respectively.

2. Agent 1: We'll select items that maximize their valuation next. Items 5, 0, and 2 are among the highest valued by Agent 1, with values of 59, 43, and 50, respectively. Since item 2 is taken, we will consider the next best item, which would be item 6, but it's also taken, so we move to item 3.

3. Agent 2: We'll select items that maximize their valuation. Items 5, 6, and 2 are among the highest valued by Agent 2, with values of 95, 93, and 91, respectively. Since items 5, 6, and 2 are taken, we look at the next highest, which are items 0, 1, and 4.

Allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 1, 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5, 8
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7, 4

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 5, 8],
    "2": [6, 7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives 3 items and aims to balance their valuations as much as possible given the constraints.
