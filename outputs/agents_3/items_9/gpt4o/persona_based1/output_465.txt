Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  98  32  12  23  59  73  49   1
1  38  71  58  41  49  81   0  89  61
2  10  89  85  95  23  82  55  59  75
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, I will use the following strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum the values each agent assigns to all the items to have a sense of their total valuation.
2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**: Allocate items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.
3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that each agent receives at least three items (since there are 9 items and 3 agents), and attempt to balance perceived value.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
- Agent 0: \(54 + 98 + 32 + 12 + 23 + 59 + 73 + 49 + 1 = 401\)
- Agent 1: \(38 + 71 + 58 + 41 + 49 + 81 + 0 + 89 + 61 = 488\)
- Agent 2: \(10 + 89 + 85 + 95 + 23 + 82 + 55 + 59 + 75 = 573\)

### Step 2: Greedy Allocation
- Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:
  - Item 0: Agent 0 (54)
  - Item 1: Agent 0 (98)
  - Item 2: Agent 2 (85)
  - Item 3: Agent 2 (95)
  - Item 4: Agent 1 (49)
  - Item 5: Agent 1 (81)
  - Item 6: Agent 0 (73)
  - Item 7: Agent 1 (89)
  - Item 8: Agent 2 (75)

### Step 3: Adjust for Fairness
- Ensure the distribution of items is fair and balanced, aiming for envy-freeness.

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 6] (Total value: 54 + 98 + 73 = 225)
- Agent 1: [4, 5, 7] (Total value: 49 + 81 + 89 = 219)
- Agent 2: [2, 3, 8] (Total value: 85 + 95 + 75 = 255)

Each agent receives three items, and the allocation attempts to balance total perceived value among agents.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3, 8]
}
```
