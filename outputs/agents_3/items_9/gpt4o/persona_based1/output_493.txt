Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  42  16  80  79  59  57   0   9
1   5  97  73  68  91  25  97  71  87
2  36  75  26  90  64  99  51  22  68
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while trying to minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent. In this scenario, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation that strives to balance the valuations and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 1, 2, and 8 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a particularly high valuation for items 5, 6, and 7.

Allocating items based on these observations, we get:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, and 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2, and 8
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6, and 7

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent gets based on their preferences.

Here is the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 8],
    "2": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
