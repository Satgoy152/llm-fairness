Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  87  89  65  79  26  54  28   9
1  90  23  33  53  21  45  30  38  86
2  41  95  29  82  38  49  36  28  50
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that approximates envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent, given the constraint of allocating an integer number of items.

Let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 31 + 87 + 89 + 65 + 79 + 26 + 54 + 28 + 9 = 468
- Agent 1's total value: 90 + 23 + 33 + 53 + 21 + 45 + 30 + 38 + 86 = 419
- Agent 2's total value: 41 + 95 + 29 + 82 + 38 + 49 + 36 + 28 + 50 = 448

Now, we attempt to allocate the items while considering these valuations:

1. Sort the items based on the value each agent assigns to them.
2. Iteratively assign the highest-valued remaining items to each agent, attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's perform this allocation:

Agent 0 prefers: 2 (89), 1 (87), 4 (79), 3 (65), 6 (54), 0 (31), 5 (26), 7 (28), 8 (9).
Agent 1 prefers: 0 (90), 8 (86), 3 (53), 5 (45), 7 (38), 2 (33), 4 (21), 6 (30), 1 (23).
Agent 2 prefers: 1 (95), 3 (82), 8 (50), 5 (49), 4 (38), 6 (36), 0 (41), 7 (28), 2 (29).

To balance the total value, consider the following allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: [2, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 8]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 5, 7]

Let's verify the allocations:
- Agent 0's total value: 89 (item 2) + 79 (item 4) + 54 (item 6) = 222
- Agent 1's total value: 90 (item 0) + 86 (item 8) = 176
- Agent 2's total value: 95 (item 1) + 82 (item 3) + 49 (item 5) + 28 (item 7) = 254

This allocation is a fair attempt given the preferences and constraints. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [1, 3, 5, 7]
}
```
