Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  96  83  27  71  89  22  87  51
1  87   9  75  98  93  86  37  11  22
2  52  12  35  13  51  30  78  44  30
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[34 96 83 27 71 89 22 87 51]
 [87  9 75 98 93 86 37 11 22]
 [52 12 35 13 51 30 78 44 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

We have 3 agents and 9 items to distribute. Let's try to achieve a fair allocation based on the agents' valuations.

### Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: [34, 96, 83, 27, 71, 89, 22, 87, 51]
- Agent 1: [87, 9, 75, 98, 93, 86, 37, 11, 22]
- Agent 2: [52, 12, 35, 13, 51, 30, 78, 44, 30]

### Allocating Items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest Value: Item 1 (96)
   - Second Highest Value: Item 5 (89)
   - Third Highest Value: Item 7 (87)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest Value: Item 3 (98)
   - Second Highest Value: Item 4 (93)
   - Third Highest Value: Item 0 (87)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest Value: Item 6 (78)
   - Second Highest Value: Item 2 (35)
   - Third Highest Value: Item 8 (30)

### Proposed Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 0]
- Agent 2: [6, 2, 8]

All 9 items are allocated, and each agent receives 3 items. This allocation aims to balance the distribution according to each agent's highest preferences.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 0],
    "2": [6, 2, 8]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives some of their most valued items.
