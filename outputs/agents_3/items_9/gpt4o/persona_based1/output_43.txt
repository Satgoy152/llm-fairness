Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  89  60  52  98  71  67  94  76
1  97  85  45  46   8   0  64  88  71
2  15  10  32   8  95  77   4   1  92
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for a division method that satisfies fairness criteria, such as envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations of each agent for the items, we can use a simple round-robin method or another fair allocation method to ensure all items are distributed equitably.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 4, 1, and 7.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0, 7, and 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 4, 8, and 5.

Considering these observations, we can allocate the items as follows to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 7, and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 4, 5, and 8.

This allocation is made to balance the perceived value each agent gets from their allocated items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 7, 3],
    "2": [4, 5, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives exactly three items, totaling nine items distributed among the three agents.
