Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  37   9  36  71  26  60   3  34
1  14  49  10  86  54  96  54  60  36
2   6  25  40  27  16  98  75  19  53
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving exact envy-freeness can sometimes be challenging, especially with integer constraints, but we can aim to approximate fairness as best as possible.

First, we evaluate each agentâ€™s total valuation for all items and consider strategies like maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or reducing the envy among agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3 (86) and item 5 (96), so we allocate these items to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 (98) and item 6 (75), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
3. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for item 4 (71) and item 6 (60), but since we allocated item 6 to Agent 2, we assign item 4 to Agent 0.
4. Continue this process, trying to distribute the items such that each agent gets valuable items according to their own valuations without overlapping.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6, 8

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a decent share of the total valuation according to their preferences, given the constraints.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6, 8]
}
```
