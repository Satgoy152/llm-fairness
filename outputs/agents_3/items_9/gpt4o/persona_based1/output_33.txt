Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  67  41  94  97  74  35  33  58
1  77  91  90  76  22  93  61  63  39
2  97  97  25  28  51  78  67  86  82
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents by considering their individual valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the constraints. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) criterion, where each agent should prefer their allocation over that of any other agent, given their valuations. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0:  [59, 67, 41, 94, 97, 74, 35, 33, 58]
Agent 1:  [77, 91, 90, 76, 22, 93, 61, 63, 39]
Agent 2:  [97, 97, 25, 28, 51, 78, 67, 86, 82]
```

We need to allocate 9 items in total, ensuring that each agent receives an allocation that they value highly, while trying to maintain fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Assignments Based on Maximum Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest: 97
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest: 91
   - Agent 2 values item 0 and item 1 the highest: 97 (but item 1 is already taken by Agent 1)

2. **Second Choices After Initial Assignments:**
   - Agent 0's second-highest valued item: 3 (94)
   - Agent 1's second-highest valued item: 5 (93)
   - Agent 2's second-highest valued item: 5 (78; already taken) or 7 (86)

3. **Continue Assigning Based on Next Highest Values:**
   - Agent 0: Items 4, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 5, 2 (valued at 90)
   - Agent 2: Items 0, 7, 8 (valued at 82)

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0** prefers items 4, 3
- **Agent 1** prefers items 1, 5, 2
- **Agent 2** prefers items 0, 7, 8

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on highest individual valuations and ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 5, 2],
    "2": [0, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, with the aim of achieving a fair distribution.
