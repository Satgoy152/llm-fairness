Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  40  52   2  73  58  24  93   8
1  84  29  76  86  74  85  47  65  75
2  60  72  50  39  19  21  91  34  51
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 40 52  2 73 58 24 93  8]
 [84 29 76 86 74 85 47 65 75]
 [60 72 50 39 19 21 91 34 51]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while maintaining an envy-free allocation if possible. Given the provided valuations, we will proceed with the allocation by considering the agents' preferences and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.

First, let's examine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 97 + 40 + 52 + 2 + 73 + 58 + 24 + 93 + 8 = 347
- Agent 1: 84 + 29 + 76 + 86 + 74 + 85 + 47 + 65 + 75 = 621
- Agent 2: 60 + 72 + 50 + 39 + 19 + 21 + 91 + 34 + 51 = 437

Now, let's try to allocate the items based on agents' highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives approximately equal value:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (97), and it is the highest value for any item.
2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item highly (86) and it provides a good start towards balancing their total value.
3. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most (91), which helps balance their total value.
4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item second most (72).
5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item (74), and it helps balance their total value.
6. **Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item (93), helping balance their total value.
7. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item (76).
8. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item (85), further balancing their total value.
9. **Allocate Item 8 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values this item (51), which helps balance their total value.

The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 7
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4, 2, 5
- Agent 2 receives items: 6, 1, 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 2, 5],
    "2": [6, 1, 8]
}
```
