Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  46   8  76  52  84   2  24   4
1  11  70  50  99  77   4  55  93  98
2  56  30  31  26  29  60  76  58  22
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness where each agent would prefer their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle, given their valuations.

First, let's examine the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0: \(92 + 46 + 8 + 76 + 52 + 84 + 2 + 24 + 4 = 388\)
- Agent 1: \(11 + 70 + 50 + 99 + 77 + 4 + 55 + 93 + 98 = 557\)
- Agent 2: \(56 + 30 + 31 + 26 + 29 + 60 + 76 + 58 + 22 = 388\)

Given this, one approach is to try and distribute items such that each agent's perceived total value is approximately equal. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 92
   - Item 2: Value 8
   - Item 5: Value 84
   - Total Value: \(92 + 8 + 84 = 184\)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 99
   - Item 7: Value 93
   - Item 8: Value 98
   - Total Value: \(99 + 93 + 98 = 290\)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: Value 30
   - Item 4: Value 29
   - Item 6: Value 76
   - Total Value: \(30 + 29 + 76 = 135\)

This allocation is based on balancing the total perceived value across agents. The sums are not perfectly equal, but given the constraints, this allocation minimizes envy as much as possible.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
