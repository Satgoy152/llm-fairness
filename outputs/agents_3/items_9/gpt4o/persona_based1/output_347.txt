Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  55  78   6  61  64  93  53  45
1  21  55  71  56  55  78  83  35  63
2  51  14  64  58  33  20  16   2  66
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and provides a balanced distribution of value. A common approach to this problem is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent selects their most valued item in turn, until all items are allocated.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  55  78   6  61  64  93  53  45
1  21  55  71  56  55  78  83  35  63
2  51  14  64  58  33  20  16   2  66
```

Let's allocate the items using a round-robin method:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 6 (value 93)
   - Agent 1 selects item 2 (value 71)
   - Agent 2 selects item 8 (value 66)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 5 (value 64)
   - Agent 1 selects item 5 (value 78) - already taken, selects item 1 (value 55)
   - Agent 2 selects item 0 (value 51)

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 4 (value 61)
   - Agent 1 selects item 3 (value 56)
   - Agent 2 selects item 7 (value 2)

Now, we verify the allocation and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 5, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 1, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [8, 0, 7]

This allocation results in each agent receiving 3 items, and all 9 items are allocated. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5, 4],
    "1": [2, 1, 3],
    "2": [8, 0, 7]
}
```
