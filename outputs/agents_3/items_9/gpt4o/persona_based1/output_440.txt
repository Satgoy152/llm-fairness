Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50   9  79  45   3  94  70  50  99
1  15  54  99  85  70  17  91  77  82
2  99  91  48  31  38  74  20  77  81
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, given their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items, and we want to distribute the items to minimize envy.
   - We'll start by trying to give each agent their most valued items, as long as it doesn't lead to significant envy from others.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 8 (99), item 2 (79), and item 5 (94).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (99), item 8 (82), and item 3 (85).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 0 (99), item 1 (91), and item 8 (81).

3. **Item Allocation**:
   - Initially allocate each agent their highest-valued item:
     - Agent 0 gets item 8.
     - Agent 1 gets item 2.
     - Agent 2 gets item 0.

4. **Subsequent Allocations**:
   - Give Agent 0 the next highest available valued item, item 5.
   - Give Agent 1 the next highest available valued item, item 3.
   - Give Agent 2 the next highest available valued item, item 1.
   - Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest available values to each agent:
     - Agent 0 gets item 7.
     - Agent 1 gets item 4.
     - Agent 2 gets items 6.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 8],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, ensuring that the allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given these constraints.
