Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  40  70  54  66  97   8  45  11
1  63  45  98  76  17  88  39  42  66
2   0  57  12  73  86  56  26  66  13
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to find an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use the "envy-free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from another agent's bundle.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [74, 40, 70, 54, 66, 97, 8, 45, 11]
- Agent 1 values: [63, 45, 98, 76, 17, 88, 39, 42, 66]
- Agent 2 values: [0, 57, 12, 73, 86, 56, 26, 66, 13]

A possible allocation approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while keeping the allocation envy-free up to one item. We will assign items to agents based on their highest valuations that haven't already been assigned.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 5 (Value: 97)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (Value: 74)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (Value: 70)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (Already allocated)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (Value: 76)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (Already allocated)
   - Next highest: Item 8 (Value: 66)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (Value: 86)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (Already allocated)
   - Next highest: Item 7 (Value: 66)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (Value: 57)

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 8]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 4, 7, 6]

Let's verify that all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4, 7, 6]

Every item from 0 to 8 is allocated exactly once, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation preferences.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 7, 6]
}
```
