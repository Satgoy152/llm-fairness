Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  12  31   9  90  43  56  47  72
1  67  50  15  74  97  62  95  48  70
2  13  15  82  22  26  30  17  96  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents such that envy-freeness is considered, we can use an algorithmic approach like the adjusted winner procedure or a similar fair division technique. Here we will aim for an allocation where each agent values their share at least as much as the others.

Let's start by analyzing the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Items: 0 (30), 1 (12), 2 (31), 3 (9), 4 (90), 5 (43), 6 (56), 7 (47), 8 (72)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Items: 0 (67), 1 (50), 2 (15), 3 (74), 4 (97), 5 (62), 6 (95), 7 (48), 8 (70)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Items: 0 (13), 1 (15), 2 (82), 3 (22), 4 (26), 5 (30), 6 (17), 7 (96), 8 (77)

Let's try to allocate the items by considering the highest value items for each agent and trying to ensure no agent envies another's allocations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (90) and item 8 (72). Let's allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (97) and item 6 (95), but item 4 is already allocated. Let's allocate item 6 (95) and item 3 (74) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 7 (96) and item 2 (82). Let's allocate these to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated:
- Agent 0: items 4 and 8
- Agent 1: items 6 and 3
- Agent 2: items 7 and 2

The remaining items are 0, 1, and 5. Let's allocate these, considering remaining values:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 (30), item 5 (43), and item 1 (12). Item 5 is highest, so let's allocate it.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 (67), item 5 (62), and item 1 (50). Item 0 is highest, so let's allocate it.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 (13), item 5 (30), and item 1 (15). Item 1 is highest, so let's allocate it.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: items 4, 8, 5
- Agent 1: items 6, 3, 0
- Agent 2: items 7, 2, 1

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8, 5],
    "1": [6, 3, 0],
    "2": [7, 2, 1]
}
```
