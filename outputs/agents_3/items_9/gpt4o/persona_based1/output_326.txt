Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  96  76  11  78  29   3  67  30
1  10  83  87  25  36  92  53  83  55
2  56  75  56  82  90  12  11  23  26
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent should feel they received as much value as possible given the constraints. We have the following table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  96  76  11  78  29   3  67  30
1  10  83  87  25  36  92  53  83  55
2  56  75  56  82  90  12  11  23  26
```

We will try to distribute items so that each agent maximizes their perceived value while ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same total value. A possible allocation that considers these factors is:

- Agent 0 should receive items that they value highly.
- Agent 1 should receive items that they value highly.
- Agent 2 should receive items that they value highly.

Let's strategically allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items such as 1 (96) and 4 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize high-value items such as 5 (92) and 2 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize high-value items such as 4 (90) and 3 (82).

Given these priorities, let's attempt a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 0, 7] (Total value: 96 + 73 + 67 = 236)
- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 2, 8] (Total value: 92 + 87 + 55 = 234)
- **Agent 2**: Items [4, 3, 6] (Total value: 90 + 82 + 11 = 183)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items of high personal value, and the total value distribution is relatively even. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0, 7],
    "1": [5, 2, 8],
    "2": [4, 3, 6]
}
```
