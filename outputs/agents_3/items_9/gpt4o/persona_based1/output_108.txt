Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  89  17  14  74  44  85  48   0
1  87  30  15  80   7  53  39  84   6
2  11  74   2   4  87  81  37   7  79
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

First, let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share and no agent envies another.

1. Start by allocating the items with the highest valuations to each agent.

2. Balance the remaining items among the agents to minimize envy.

Using this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 6. 
- Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 5.

We can allocate the remaining items to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 3, 7
- Agent 2 gets items: 2, 4, 5, 8

This allocation considers the highest values and attempts to balance the allocation to minimize envy.

Final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 7],
    "2": [2, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated and aims to minimize envy among the agents based on their valuations.
