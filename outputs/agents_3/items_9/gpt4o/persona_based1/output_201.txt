Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  49  48  13  78  50  91  89  33
1  26  88  29  38  46   3  62  71  79
2  19  39  11  16  96  22  38  88  77
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations, while also keeping the allocation envy-free if possible. Here, an envy-free allocation means no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items such that:

1. Each agent receives a fair share.
2. The allocation minimizes envy among agents.

### Valuations:

- **Agent 0**: [85, 49, 48, 13, 78, 50, 91, 89, 33]
- **Agent 1**: [26, 88, 29, 38, 46, 3, 62, 71, 79]
- **Agent 2**: [19, 39, 11, 16, 96, 22, 38, 88, 77]

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for items 0, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values items 1 and 8 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 4 and 7 highly.

We will allocate each agent items that maximize their total valuation while trying to ensure the distribution is as envy-free as possible.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0, 6, and 7.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 1, and 8.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2, 3, 4, 5.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Valuation = 85 (item 0) + 91 (item 6) + 89 (item 7) = 265
- **Agent 1**: Valuation = 88 (item 1) + 79 (item 8) = 167
- **Agent 2**: Valuation = 11 (item 2) + 16 (item 3) + 96 (item 4) + 22 (item 5) = 145

This allocation attempts to minimize envy, as each agent receives items they value highly.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation results in all items being assigned, with each agent receiving a bundle that should be relatively satisfying according to their valuations.
