Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  28  52  80  12  72  62  65  44
1   1  81  30  96  99  50  36  73  36
2  91  27  44  29  14  93  82  36  64
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[71 28 52 80 12 72 62 65 44]
 [ 1 81 30 96 99 50 36 73 36]
 [91 27 44 29 14 93 82 36 64]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items with a valuation that reflects some notion of fairness, such as maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring envy-freeness.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  28  52  80  12  72  62  65  44
1   1  81  30  96  99  50  36  73  36
2  91  27  44  29  14  93  82  36  64
```

We need to allocate the items among the three agents (0, 1, and 2) such that each agent's allocation is fair based on their respective valuations.

One way to approach this is to use an algorithm like the envy-freeness with a minimum number of envy pairs, or simply trying to balance the total value each agent receives. Here, we'll use a simple approach to ensure that each agent ends up with a set of items that maximizes their perceived value while ensuring no agent is envious of another.

Allocation strategy:
1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents starting with the item that has the highest valuation for any agent, ensuring that each agent gets the item they value the most, and then proceed with the next highest, ensuring balance in total value.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: item 3 (80), item 5 (72)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: item 4 (99), item 3 (96)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: item 0 (91), item 5 (93)

Now, let's distribute the remaining items by balancing the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 5] total value = 152
- **Agent 1**: [4] total value = 99
- **Agent 2**: [0, 6] total value = 173

Now we continue assigning the remaining items:
- **Agent 0**: gets item 1 (28), item 7 (65)
- **Agent 1**: gets item 2 (30), item 8 (36)
- **Agent 2**: gets item 6 (82)

Final distribution:
- Agent 0: [3, 5, 1, 7]
- Agent 1: [4, 2, 8]
- Agent 2: [0, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly while trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 1, 7],
    "1": [4, 2, 8],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
