Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62   1  28  22  46  97  91  58  71
1  51  76   8  31  54  77  63  29  39
2  53  42  49  15  47  75  29  52  36
    
    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and try to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Given the table of valuations, we can employ a method that balances the total value perceived by each agent.

Here are the steps we'll follow to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: For each agent, calculate the total valuation of all items to understand their maximum perceived value.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by allocating items to each agent in a way that maximizes their individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item initially.

3. **Adjust for Balance**: Adjust allocations if necessary to balance the total perceived value across agents, aiming for envy-freeness.

Let's go through these steps:

### Calculations

1. **Total Valuations for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 62 + 1 + 28 + 22 + 46 + 97 + 91 + 58 + 71 = 476
   - Agent 1: 51 + 76 + 8 + 31 + 54 + 77 + 63 + 29 + 39 = 428
   - Agent 2: 53 + 42 + 49 + 15 + 47 + 75 + 29 + 52 + 36 = 398

2. **Initial Allocations Based on Maximum Values**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (97) and item 6 (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (76) and item 5 (77).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (75) and item 0 (53).

3. **Adjusting Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate high-value items like 5 and 6 initially.
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 1 and consider their second choice.
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 0 and consider other items that are less valued by others but reasonably valued by Agent 2.

### Final Allocations

After balancing and ensuring each agent feels satisfied, we reach the following fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

- **Agent 0** receives items 5, 6, and 7, which are among the highest-valued items for them.
- **Agent 1** receives items 1, 4, and 8, balancing their high value and giving them a fair share.
- **Agent 2** receives items 0, 2, and 3, ensuring they get their highest valued item as well.

This allocation considers the perceived values and aims to minimize envy, ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair amount relative to their valuations.
