Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  38  96  19  39  26  53
1  68  58  76  94  58  92  59
2  79  69  41  50  18  27   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 1.

Based on this, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 4

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5, 6],
    "2": [1, 4]
}
```
