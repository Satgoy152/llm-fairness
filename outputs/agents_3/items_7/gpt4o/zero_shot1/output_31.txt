Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  44  42  55  89  93  19
1  63  47  92  85   2  71  45
2   7  96  32  85  32  65  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Given that there are only 7 items and 3 agents, not every agent will receive the same number of items. We aim to distribute the items in a way that balances fairness and maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Start by assigning items to the agents based on the highest valuations they have for those items, ensuring that no two agents receive the same item.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:** After assigning the items with the highest valuations, distribute the remaining items by considering the next best valuations, keeping an eye on the overall balance in terms of the number of items each agent receives.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:** Double-check that all items have been assigned and that the distribution is as fair as possible in terms of both the number of items and the total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1, and moderate valuations for items 0 and 6.

Following this analysis, we can assign the items as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Items 4 and 5 (high valuations for both).
- **Agent 1:** Items 2 and 3 (high valuations).
- **Agent 2:** Items 0, 1, and 6 (best remaining choices).

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives, given the constraint of distributing only 7 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are fairly allocated among the agents while considering their individual valuations.
