Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65   4  63   1  59  96  53
1  96  73  13  12   2  17  19
2  67  42  23  33  27  41  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65  4 63  1 59 96 53]
 [96 73 13 12  2 17 19]
 [67 42 23 33 27 41 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **List the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [65, 4, 63, 1, 59, 96, 53]
   - Agent 1: [96, 73, 13, 12, 2, 17, 19]
   - Agent 2: [67, 42, 23, 33, 27, 41, 43]

2. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Start by examining which agent values each item the most.
   - Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Item 0: Highest valuation is Agent 1 (96).
   - Item 1: Highest valuation is Agent 1 (73).
   - Item 2: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (63).
   - Item 3: Highest valuation is Agent 2 (33).
   - Item 4: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (59).
   - Item 5: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (96).
   - Item 6: Highest valuation is Agent 2 (43).

4. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - Review the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item. Adjust if necessary, but in this case, each agent has received items based on their highest valuations.

5. **Check Total Number of Allocations:**
   - Make sure exactly 7 items are allocated.

Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 6]
}
```
