Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  27  30  36  85  85  34
1  76  72  79  45  58  15  26
2  15  93  10  60  26  70  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 93 10 60 26 70 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item whenever possible. Let's consider the optimal allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest-valued item: Item 4 (value 85)
   - Second highest-valued item: Item 5 (value 85)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest-valued item: Item 2 (value 79)
   - Second highest-valued item: Item 0 (value 76)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest-valued item: Item 1 (value 93)
   - Second highest-valued item: Item 6 (value 77)
   - Third highest-valued item: Item 5 (value 70)

Based on this, we can try the following assignment:

- **Agent 0** gets items with the highest value for them: Items 4 and 5
- **Agent 1** gets items with the highest value for them: Items 2 and 0
- **Agent 2** gets items with the highest value for them: Items 1, 3, and 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly and all 7 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
