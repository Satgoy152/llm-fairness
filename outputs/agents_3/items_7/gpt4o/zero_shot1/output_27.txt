Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  82  34  14  69  78  80
1  82  29  89  14  93   4  54
2  15  84   2  98  90  82  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. One way to approach this is to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign the items with the highest unique valuations to each agent first:

   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (78).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (93).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (98).

2. Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest unique valuations:

   - Agent 0: Item 6 (80) has the highest valuation for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (89) has the highest valuation for Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (84) has the highest valuation for Agent 2.

3. Allocate the last remaining item:

   - Item 0 can be allocated to Agent 1 (82), since that agent has the highest valuation for this item.

Based on this allocation strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 2, 0],
    "2": [3, 1]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized based on the given preferences.
