Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  72  82  51  70   0  78
1  40  10   9  59  99  74  24
2  36  66  64  55  25  87  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items based on each agent's valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 1. We can assign items 2 and 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has the highest valuation for item 4, which is the highest single valuation across all agents. We assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 also has a decent valuation for item 5, so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 5, but since item 5 is already assigned, we focus on other items.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (it was a close second for Agent 0, but Agent 2 needs an item).
   - Also assign item 3 to Agent 2 as it has a reasonable valuation and is unallocated.

4. Remaining item:
   - Item 0 is unassigned. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent.
