Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  46   2  70  56  71  23
1  23  78  81  58  53   4  65
2  94  19  60  10  79  84  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. An optimal approach is to use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm, but since we only have 7 items and 3 agents, we can also manually ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's look at the items and values for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: [25, 46, 2, 70, 56, 71, 23]
- Agent 1 values: [23, 78, 81, 58, 53, 4, 65]
- Agent 2 values: [94, 19, 60, 10, 79, 84, 87]

The goal is to maximize fairness while distributing all 7 items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value 94)
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 78)
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 81)
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 70)
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 79)
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 71)
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 87)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their highest values. Here is the JSON output for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent a fair number of items while maximizing the total value for each agent based on their individual preferences.
