Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  33  17  96  58  72  31
1  47  76  68  35  24  31  74
2  94   0  75   5  27  61  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation or use an equitable distribution strategy like the one below:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's look at each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 16
  - Agent 1: 47
  - Agent 2: 94
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 33
  - Agent 1: 76
  - Agent 2: 0
  - Assign to Agent 1

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 17
  - Agent 1: 68
  - Agent 2: 75
  - Assign to Agent 2

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 96
  - Agent 1: 35
  - Agent 2: 5
  - Assign to Agent 0

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 58
  - Agent 1: 24
  - Agent 2: 27
  - Assign to Agent 0

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0: 72
  - Agent 1: 31
  - Agent 2: 61
  - Assign to Agent 0

- Item 6:
  - Agent 0: 31
  - Agent 1: 74
  - Agent 2: 19
  - Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's provide the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent their most valued items as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.
