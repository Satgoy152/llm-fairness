Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  77   3  79  14  58  47
1  29  90   4  18   2  65  33
2  48  30  53  48   0   1  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction. One common approach in such allocation problems is to use a method similar to the "Max-Min Fairness" or "Envy-Free" allocation, where we try to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the highest valuation of 90.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 has the highest valuation of 79.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as agent 2 has the highest valuation of 79.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 has the highest valuation of 35.
5. Assign item 5 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the highest valuation of 65.
6. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 has the highest valuation of 53.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation of 14.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are distributed based on their valuations to maximize satisfaction.
