Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  79  99  62  32  72  45
1  74  11   7  87  18  77  33
2  37  88  68  53  79  67  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for maximizing overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0's highest values:**
   - Item 2: 99
   - Item 1: 79
   - Item 5: 72

2. **Agent 1's highest values:**
   - Item 3: 87
   - Item 0: 74
   - Item 5: 77

3. **Agent 2's highest values:**
   - Item 1: 88
   - Item 4: 79
   - Item 6: 71

Next, let's allocate items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Assign the highest valued item 2 (value 99) to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 87) to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (value 88) and item 4 (value 79) to Agent 2.
- **Remaining items**: Assign items to balance the allocation:
  - Assign item 0 (value 37) to Agent 0.
  - Assign item 5 (value 67) to Agent 2.
  - Assign item 6 (value 45) to Agent 0.

This allocation balances the total value received by each agent reasonably well.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent getting a reasonable share based on their valuations.
