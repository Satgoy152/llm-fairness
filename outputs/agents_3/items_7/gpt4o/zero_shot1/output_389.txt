Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  29  76  78  20  63  59
1  29  42  98  17  55  71  54
2  70  16  67  68  97  44   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 42 98 17 55 71 54]
 [70 16 67 68 97 44  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's preferences:

- Agent 0 values items highly at: 95, 76, 78, 63, and 59.
- Agent 1 values items highly at: 98, 71, and 55.
- Agent 2 values items highly at: 97, 70, and 68.

A potential allocation strategy is to give each agent the items they value the most, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this:

1. Give Agent 1 item 2 (value 98), as this is the highest value for any agent.
2. Give Agent 2 item 4 (value 97), as it is the next highest value.
3. Give Agent 0 item 0 (value 95), as it is the next highest value.
4. Then, give Agent 0 item 3 (value 78), as it is their next highest available item.
5. Give Agent 2 item 3 (value 68), as it is their next highest available item.
6. Give Agent 1 item 5 (value 71), as it is their next highest available item.
7. Give Agent 0 item 1 (value 29), as it is their next highest available item.

After these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.
