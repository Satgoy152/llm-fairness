Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  39  85  78  89  39  96
1  31  19  86   5  12  45   9
2  55  13   4  71   4   9  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 39 85 78 89 39 96]
 [31 19 86  5 12 45  9]
 [55 13  4 71  4  9 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One possible way to achieve this is by applying a greedy algorithm that assigns items one at a time to the agent who values it the most and hasn't yet been allocated that item, until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Agent 2 values it at 55.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 39.
   - Agent 1 values it at 19.
   - Agent 2 values it at 13.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 85.
   - Agent 1 values it at 86.
   - Agent 2 values it at 4.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78.
   - Agent 1 values it at 5.
   - Agent 2 values it at 71.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Agent 2 values it at 4.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 39.
   - Agent 1 values it at 45.
   - Agent 2 values it at 9.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Agent 1 values it at 9.
   - Agent 2 values it at 91.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": []
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 has been allocated the majority of items as they had the highest valuations for many items, while Agent 1 received two items. Agent 2 unfortunately did not receive any items, as their valuations were generally lower compared to the other agents for the given items.
