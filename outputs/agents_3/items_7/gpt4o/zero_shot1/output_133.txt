Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  57  62   3  97  18  37
1   0  88   5  23  39  27  84
2  95  17  38  98  28  69  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 88  5 23 39 27 84]
 [95 17 38 98 28 69 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the three agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. First, let's try to allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (88).

2. Next, allocate the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations:
   - Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (95).
   - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (62).
   - Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (69).
   - Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1 (84).

Considering these allocations, we assign items to the agents as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 3, 5]

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 5]
}
```
