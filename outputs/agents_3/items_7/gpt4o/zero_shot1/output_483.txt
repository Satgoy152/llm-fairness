Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  55  97   8  98  45  66
1  75  25   7   1  70  11  90
2  34  91  51  57  27  87  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 3 agents, we need to distribute them in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers item 4 (value 98) and item 2 (value 97).
   - Let's assign items 4 and 2 to agent 0 for a total value of 195.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Prefers item 0 (value 75) and item 6 (value 90).
   - Let's assign items 0 and 6 to agent 1 for a total value of 165.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Prefers item 1 (value 91), item 5 (value 87), and item 3 (value 57).
   - Let's assign items 1, 5, and 3 to agent 2 for a total value of 235.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 5, 3]
}
```
