Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  51  85  82  89  91  55
1  91  97  77  61  59  82  63
2   2  97  50  16   5  14  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 51 85 82 89 91 55]
 [91 97 77 61 59 82 63]
 [ 2 97 50 16  5 14 76]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Given the valuations for each agent, we can follow a strategy that prioritizes each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total items.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are distributed among the agents.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6]
}
```
