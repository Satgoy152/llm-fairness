Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  95  66  27  80  97  77
1  15  85  38  10   2  93  62
2  35   5  72  19  12  17  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 95 66 27 80 97 77]
 [15 85 38 10  2 93 62]
 [35  5 72 19 12 17 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 5 (97) and also high valuations for items 1 (95) and 6 (77). By allocating these items to agent 0, we maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the highest (38) and also has a high valuation for item 3 (10), relative to the other agents' valuations for these items.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0 (35) and item 4 (12), relative to the other agents.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 5, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 4

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and we have a total of 7 items allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```
