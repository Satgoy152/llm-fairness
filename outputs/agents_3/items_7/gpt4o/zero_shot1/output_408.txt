Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  84  42  38  13  75  49
1   1  52  90  43  81  37  61
2  67  68  55  20  65  63  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the valuations to guide the distribution. A common approach is to maximize the total value assigned to all agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Each agent should receive a comparable total value of items, if possible, based on their individual preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Values are [18, 84, 42, 38, 13, 75, 49]
- Agent 1: Values are [1, 52, 90, 43, 81, 37, 61]
- Agent 2: Values are [67, 68, 55, 20, 65, 63, 22]

One possible allocation strategy is to assign the items such that each agent's total value is as balanced as possible:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 84)
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 90)
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 67)
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 81)
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value = 75)
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 38)
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value = 22)

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their highest valuation items and maintains balance across the agents:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5, 3] with total value = 84 + 75 + 38 = 197
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4] with total value = 90 + 81 = 171
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6] with total value = 67 + 22 = 89

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 6]
}
```
