Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52   7  29  59  52  80  40
1  41  76   6  15  20  85  12
2  33  24  51  11  98  50  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's total valuation, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We can use a simple greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's how we can do it:

1. Identify the items each agent values the most and try to allocate them accordingly.
2. If any agent hasn't been allocated an item, assign them one of the remaining items.

Let's go through the process:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 52.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 76.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 51.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 59.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 98.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 85.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 98.

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0 has items: [0, 3]
- Agent 1 has items: [1, 5]
- Agent 2 has items: [2, 4, 6]

All agents have at least one item. Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
