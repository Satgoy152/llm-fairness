Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  17   9   6  49  20  84
1   8   4  85  32  96  31   6
2  49  40  54  82   0  25  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8  4 85 32 96 31  6]
 [49 40 54 82  0 25 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. We can approach this by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets some items if possible. 

Let's process the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 39
   - Agent 1 values it at 8
   - Agent 2 values it at 49 (highest value)

   Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 17
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Agent 2 values it at 40 (highest value)

   Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 9
   - Agent 1 values it at 85 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 54

   Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Agent 2 values it at 82 (highest value)

   Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 0

   Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 20
   - Agent 1 values it at 31 (highest value)
   - Agent 2 values it at 25

   Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 84 (highest value)
   - Agent 1 values it at 6
   - Agent 2 values it at 16

   Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

The allocations are now as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and the items are allocated primarily to the agent who values them the most.
