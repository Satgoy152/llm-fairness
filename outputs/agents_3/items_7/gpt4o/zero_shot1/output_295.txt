Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  58  33  57  15  74  22
1   2  86   0  68  49  85  43
2   6  49  97  60   0  62  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 86  0 68 49 85 43]
 [ 6 49 97 60  0 62 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items: 0 (72) and 5 (74).
   - Allocate item 0 and item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items: 1 (86) and 5 (85), but item 5 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 1 and item 3 (68) to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
   - Remaining items are 4 and 6. Agent 2 has higher valuations for these items compared to others: item 4 (0, not preferred), item 6 (59).
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

4. **Re-evaluate remaining item 4**:
   - Item 4 is left. Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (49).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
