Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  95  33  60  64  40  30
1  61  29  27  24   6  75  15
2  22  30  90  32  53  10  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that considers maximizing the collective satisfaction of the agents. One potential approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value relatively higher compared to others. Let's analyze the valuations and make assignments:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 95 (highest valuation overall)
- Item 2: 33
- Item 3: 60
- Item 4: 64
- Item 5: 40
- Item 6: 30

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 61
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 24
- Item 4: 6
- Item 5: 75 (highest valuation overall)
- Item 6: 15

Agent 2's valuations:
- Item 0: 22
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 90 (highest valuation overall)
- Item 3: 32
- Item 4: 53
- Item 5: 10
- Item 6: 13

Given these valuations, we can make the following allocations:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item overall by any agent.
2. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1, since it is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item overall by Agent 2.

Next, distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations for each agent:

4. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their next highest valued unallocated item.
5. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, since it is the next highest valuation for them.
6. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their next highest available valuation.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest unallocated item they value.

With this strategy, we allocate all items while trying to ensure each agent receives items they relatively value more.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2, 3]
}
```
