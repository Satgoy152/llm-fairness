Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  35  61  61  27   9  55
1  49  53  96  30  49  61  22
2  79  94  92  71  96  31  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by taking into account each agent's valuations. A common approach is to use a method like the "Maximum Weighted Matching" in a bipartite graph or the "Hungarian Algorithm" to find an optimal allocation. However, in this context, we can also try a more straightforward manual allocation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are assigned.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, and 4

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, providing a reasonable level of satisfaction for each agent.
