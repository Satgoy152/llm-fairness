Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  31  30  44  30  67  81
1  63  81  89  20  53  87  74
2  88  30  23   4  76  61  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 30 23  4 76 61 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items to the agent who values them most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to agents:**
   - Agent 0: Highest value item is item 6 (value 81).
   - Agent 1: Highest value item is item 2 (value 89).
   - Agent 2: Highest value item is item 6 (value 94), but item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest value is item 0 (value 88).

2. **Allocate remaining items by considering available items and maximizing each agent's total value:**
   - After initial highest allocations:
     - Agent 0 has item 6.
     - Agent 1 has item 2.
     - Agent 2 has item 0.

3. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 3, 4, 5.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 87).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 31; maximizing Agent 0's total value).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 44; maximizing Agent 0â€™s total value).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 76; maximizing Agent 2's total value).

The items are now all allocated. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4]
}
```

Here, each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, maximizing satisfaction.
