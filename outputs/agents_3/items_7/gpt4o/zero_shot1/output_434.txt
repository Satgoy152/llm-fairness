Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  56  47  79  67  12  58
1  58  36  59  77  17  42  63
2  25  20  17  93  73  53  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 56 47 79 67 12 58]
 [58 36 59 77 17 42 63]
 [25 20 17 93 73 53 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We will try to assign items such that the total value each agent gets is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 83, 56, 47, 79, 67, 12, 58
- Agent 1 values items: 58, 36, 59, 77, 17, 42, 63
- Agent 2 values items: 25, 20, 17, 93, 73, 53, 73

We can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (83) and item 3 (79).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (59) and item 3 (77).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (93) and item 4 (73).

Now let's assign the items:

- Agent 0:
  - Items 0 (83) and 1 (56) (next highest value for this agent after 79, which is assigned to another agent)

- Agent 1:
  - Items 2 (59) and 6 (63) (next highest value after 77)

- Agent 2:
  - Items 3 (93) and 4 (73) and 5 (53)

This allocation ensures that we distribute the items based on the agents' highest preferences while also balancing the overall distribution. Each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
