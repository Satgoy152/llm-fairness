Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  15  47  23  72  89   5
1   9  14  32  91  71  41  82
2  69  62  30  10   4  36  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 14 32 91 71 41 82]
 [69 62 30 10  4 36 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are assigned.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they received all items:
   - Agent 0: 0 + 15 + 47 + 23 + 72 + 89 + 5 = 251
   - Agent 1: 9 + 14 + 32 + 91 + 71 + 41 + 82 = 340
   - Agent 2: 69 + 62 + 30 + 10 + 4 + 36 + 56 = 267

2. Assign items one by one to maximize individual agent valuations while keeping the allocation fair.

3. Distribute the items to the agents as follows:

   - Agent 0 gets items that maximize its individual valuation relative to others:
     - Item 5: Valuation 89 (highest for Agent 0)
     - Item 4: Valuation 72 (next highest for Agent 0)
     - Item 2: Valuation 47 (third highest for Agent 0)
   
   - Agent 1 gets items maximizing its valuation while considering remaining items:
     - Item 3: Valuation 91 (highest for Agent 1)
     - Item 6: Valuation 82 (next highest for Agent 1)
   
   - Agent 2 gets the remaining items:
     - Item 0: Valuation 69
     - Item 1: Valuation 62

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that maximize their respective valuations given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1]
}
```
