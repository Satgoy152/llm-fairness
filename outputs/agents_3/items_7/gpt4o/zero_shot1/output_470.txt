Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  95  41  85  32  53  62
1  21  94  21   5  37  94  24
2  27  29  35  64  50  86  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of all agents by considering their valuations. A potential approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item when possible. Given that there are 7 items and 3 agents, one agent will get 3 items, and the other two will get 2 items each.

Let's start by identifying the item each agent values the most:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (86).

Since both Agent 0 and Agent 1 value item 1 highly, we will try to maximize the overall valuation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it is highly valued by them.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the second-most valued item by them.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it holds significant value and is not highly valued by other agents.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is their second-highest valued item.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest available item by valuation.
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it equally to item 0.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5]
}
```
