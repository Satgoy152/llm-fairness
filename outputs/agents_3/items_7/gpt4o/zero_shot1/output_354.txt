Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  90  42  37   8  56  12
1  28  72  27  63   3   1  77
2  69  40  31   4  21  66  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value 90)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (value 77)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 66)

2. Allocate these items to the respective agents:
   - Agent 0 gets item 1
   - Agent 1 gets item 6
   - Agent 2 gets item 5

3. Allocate the remaining items by looking at the highest remaining valuations:
   - Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 0 (value 85)
   - Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 0 (value 42)
   - Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 1 (value 63)
   - Item 4: Highest value is for Agent 2 (value 21)

Now, let's ensure that each agent ends up with at least one item and adjust if necessary (in this case, each agent already has at least one item):

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 5]
}
```
