Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 3 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33   8  72  65  91  20  32
1  64  59  84  78   8  27  28
2  87  47  77  18  75  34  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This approach might be implemented using a greedy algorithm or optimization techniques like the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. However, since there are only 7 items and 3 agents, we can try to solve this manually by checking combinations to maximize fairness.

Let's manually allocate the items to maximize the fairness of allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 4: 91 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Item 2: 72 (second highest value for Agent 0)
   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 163

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: 78 (highest value for Agent 1)
   - Item 0: 64 (second highest value for Agent 1)
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 142

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1: 47 (highest value for Agent 2)
   - Item 5: 34 (second highest value for Agent 2)
   - Item 6: 19 (third highest value for Agent 2)
   - Total valuation for Agent 2: 100

These allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items, considering the agents' valuations.
